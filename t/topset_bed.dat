Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited {{on the top of}} the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain. As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. <b>Topset</b> <b>beds</b> are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bars {{which form}} on the convex side of bends in Antelope Creek in eastern Wyoming superficially {{resemble}} point bars but have neither the genesis nor internal structure of true point bars in meandering perennial streams. Our observations of sediments in this shallow, sandy, ephemeral stream suggest that these bars are a function of "flashy " flow and large width-depth ratios which prohibit strong lateral flows related to helical cells. Apparently, sediment istransported parallel to downslream velocity vectors. During high flow, a large sediment mass is emplaced in the channel bend where flow expansion causes deposition. Further deposition takes place by vertical accretion as flows continue to overtop the bar. Subsequent low flows cause erosion of the bar by thalweg meandering and chute channel development, and deposition of fine material takes place in chute channels and on the bar margin. These processes result {{in the creation of}} a side bar with internal structure consisting of a main flood fill sediment body and vertically accreted <b>topset</b> <b>beds</b> with minor marginal foreset strata. A thin veneer of low-water fine sediment may occur on the outer bar margin and in chute channels. We suggest that hese bars should be distinguished from true point bars and other types of side bars and herein propose the descriptive term convex bar...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{bedrock of}} North and South Pender Islands, the southernmost islands of British Columbia's Gulf Islands chain, is formed entirely by six {{formations}} of the Late Cretaceous Nanaimo Group. These six formations are, from oldest to youngest, the Extens ion- Protection, Cedar District, DeCourcy, Northumberland, Geoffrey, and Spray Formations, A composite section of maximum thicknesses for these formations totals approximately 11, 600 feet. The formations, however, vary in thickness significantly along strike. These formations represent four cycles of deltaic progradation, {{the youngest and}} oldest of which are incompletely exposed. The Extension-Protection Formation {{is considered to be}} the upper part of a west- to northwest-prograding delta complex, the lower part of which is not exposed within the thesis area, The fluvial conglomerates of the Extension-Protection Formation, inferred to be <b>topset</b> <b>beds,</b> are overlain on South Pender Island by an interval of shallow marine arkosic and ljthic sandstones, This shallow marine interval pinches out to the northwest and is absent on North Fender Island. The mineralogy of the conglomerates and sandstones suggests that the ExtensionProtection Formation was derived from the pre- Cretaceous rocks of Vancouver Island. The Extension-Protection Formation intertongues with and grades into the Cedar District /DeCourcy delta. Prodelta muds of the lower Cedar District Formation are overlain by distal bar turbidites. The turbid ite deposits are conformably overlain by arkosic delta-front sheet sands or river mouth bars of the lower DeCourcy Formation. Continued basin subsidence, possibly combined with lower sedirnentation rates, caused a transgression over the lower DeCourcy Formation and a return to prodelta deposition of the upper Cedar District Formation. The upper Cedar District and upper DeCourcy Formations follow a depositional cycle {{similar to that of the}} lower Cedar District and lower DeCourcy Formations, with the exception that fluvial conglomerates inferred to be <b>topset</b> <b>beds</b> intertongue with and overlie the shallow marine delta-front sheet sands or river mouth bars. Paleocurrent data, lateral thinning and facies changes, and mineralogy suggest that the Cedar District/DeCourcy delta sediments were derived from a source, to the northwest on Vancouver Is land, which was composed of the Vancouver Group and the Island Intrusions. The vertical succession of prodelta muds, distal bar turbidites,. delta-front sheet sands or river mouth bars, and fluvial conglomerates is the same for the Northumberland/Geoffrey deltaic cycle as for the upper Cedar District /DeCourcy deltaic cycle. Paleocurrent data, lateral thinning and facies changes, and mineralogy suggest that the Northumberland/Geoffrey delta sediments were derived from a source area to the northwest, which was either the same source area as that of the Cedar District /DeCourcy delta, or one similar to it, The Spray Formation, the lower part of the youngest deltaic cycle exposed in the thesis area, consists of distal bar turbidites. The Northumberland/Geoffrey delta intertongues with the Spray Formation, although this intertonguing may be related to the overlying Gabriola Formation, At least three episodes of faulting have deformed the rocks of North and South Pender Islands, forming the Kulleet Syncline and other subordinate folds, The major faults trend west-northwest, with minor faults trending northwest to northeast...|$|R
40|$|Mogo Creek is {{an active}} sand-bed stream that drains a 213 -km 2 basin and flows into a blocked valley lake that {{functions}} as a terminal sediment sink. The blocked valley lake, in turn, discharges into the main stream, Macdonald River. A Gilbert-type fluvial delta has formed where Mogo Creek flows into the lake and a reverse delta has formed where the Macdonald River back floods into the blocked valley lake. The development of the fluvial delta since 1848 has been documented {{from a combination of}} maps, vertical air photographs and field surveys. The Mogo Creek fluvial delta prograded into the lake as a series of lobate sand bodies that episodically changed direction over time. Over a 13. 5 -year period 71 700 m 3 of sand (94 600 t) was deposited on the delta plain and in the river channel and 1042 m 3 (1150 t) was deposited on the delta front. Sediment bulk densities were determined so that the total delta depositional mass was computed as 95 790 t or 7095 t/year. Progradation of the delta front has segmented the lake by blocking a former side bay. <b>Topset</b> <b>beds</b> include channel sands and overbank deposits of levee sands, sand splays, chute sands and marsh muds. Foreset beds are delta front sets of planar tabular medium and coarse sands. Bottomset beds are horizontally-laminated prodelta sandy muds grading into massive, low density, lacustrine muds.

40|$|A tiltable, {{recirculating}} flume, 18 metres {{long and}} 76 cm. wide {{was used to}} investigate bedforms and structures near the transition between dunes and a plane bed for a moderately sorted, coarse sand. At Froude numbers ranging from about 0. 4 to 1. 0, three dune types developed: (1) asymmetrical (triangular) dunes, (2) convex (symmetrical) dunes and (3) humpback (whaleback) dunes. Asymmetrical dunes had gentle, long stoss sides and steep, short lee sides and contained cross-stratification with a maximum dip mostly about 30 degrees to 35 degrees. Flow separation and avalanching were strongly developed to the lee of these dunes. Convex dunes formed when the bed was thin and had longitudinal profiles that were convex-upward with stoss and lee sides of equal steepness. Internal cross-beds were likewise convex and formed from draping of sediment over the lee sides rather than from avalanching. Humpback dunes were the most distinctive bedforms in that on each dune profile the point of maximum elevation was offset {{from the top of}} the foreset (avalanche) slope. Immediately downstream from this maximum point, low-angle <b>topset</b> <b>bedding</b> merged uninterruptedly into steep foreset beds and these into bottomsets, producing sigmoidal bedding inside each dune. Although foreset slopes were much shorter in humpback dunes than in asymmetrical, their streepness remained mostly about 30 degrees to 35 degrees right up to the change to a plane bed at a Froude number of about 1. 1. For one other run a plane bed also formed but at a Froude number of about 1. 7, a rather high value for a plane bed just beyond the dune bed phase. This second plane bed may be that which occurs at Froude numbers larger than those for in-phase waves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{critical}} analysis of the Gura Văii – Turnu Severin – Izvoru Bârzii Gilbert-type deltas concentrated on the deltaic architecture {{and the age of}} the deltaic deposits, referring especially to the conglomeratic sediments considered the proximal foreset unit of the Gilbert-type fan deltas. It reveals the lack of evidences necessary to demonstrate the existence of the three units (foreset, bottomset and <b>topset</b> <b>beds)</b> which define a Gilbert-type delta. Although there are convincing data for its tectonic origin, the homoclinal structure of these deltaic deposits was considered, with no argumentation, as a primary structure generated through the deltaic progradation. The age of the rudaceous deposits in the area Gura Văii – Turnu Severin – Izvoru Bârzii, representing the core of the two outlined Gilbert deltas, was considered Zanclean (Bosphorian) by Clauzon et al. (2005) and Suc et al. (2011), rejecting the Badenian – Sarmatian (s. l.) age formerly attributed (Marinescu, 1978 and the references herein). The critical examination of these two concepts pointed out the paleontological and stratigraphic proofs which substantiate the Badenian-Sarmatian (s. l.) age, in contrast with the lack of evidences in favor of the Zanclean age. The Gilbert-type fan deltas figured by Clauzon et al. (2005) and Suc et al. (2011) {{in the area of the}} present-day Danube River course (area Gura Văii – Turnu Severin – Izvoru Bârzii), closely downstream of the Iron Gates, represents one of the main arguments of these authors for the action of the Messinian crisis in the Dacian Basin.

Ten lithofacies have been distinguished in the Pozuel Formation: 5 – 10 ° dipping clinobedded oolitic grainstone foresets passing to tabular oolitic packstones-grainstones, which interfinger the muddy basinal bottomsets. Landwards, the clinobeds pass into subhorizontal topsets composed of trough cross-bedded to structureless oolitic grainstones; oolitic-skeletal grainstones with stromatoporoids and coral-stromatoporoid-microbial mounds. Siliciclastic lithofacies and oncolitic/peloidal packstones occur at the innermost position. These lithofacies stack in strike elongated, 5 – 20 -m thick, 0, 5 – 2 km dip-oriented wide, aggradational-progradational packages with complex sigmoid-oblique geometries. Lithofacies, depositional geometries and stacking pattern permit to summarize the main characteristic of such Upper Jurassic oolitic infralittoral prograding wedge potentially to be applied in other oolitic sandbodies both in outcrops and subsurface: 1) sediment production within the wave action zone, 2) grainstone-dominated textures, 3) prograding basinward onto basinal muds, 4) laterally (strike) extensive, paralleling the shoreline, 5) variable thickness, commonly of few tens of meters, 6) broadly sigmoidal to oblique internal architecture, with topsets, foresets and bottomsets, 7) dip of foresets close to the angle of repose, 8) topsets deposited in shallow-water, extending through the shoreface, from the shoreline down to the wave base, 9) mounds, either microbial or skeletal, may occur in the topsets. The coated-grains factory was along the high-energy, wave-dominated outer platform (<b>topset</b> <b>beds),</b> from where the mud was winnowed and the grains transported both landward to the platform interior, and seaward to the platform edge, from were the grains cascaded down the slopes as grain flows and mass flows, forming clinobeds.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} lava–sediment {{interaction}} in dry depositional settings {{focusing on the}} Early Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequence in the Huab Basin, NW Namibia, as a detailed example. Here an active aeolian sand sea (erg) system was progressively engulfed by lavas of the Etendeka Flood Basalt Province 133 Ma BP. This volcanic flooding resulted in: (1) the unprecedented preservation of {{large parts of the}} active dune system; (2) the development of a variety of sediment interlayers; and (3) a record of excellent examples of the dynamic interaction between lava and aeolian sand. The lava–sediment interaction happens on a variety of scales from simple sediment interbeds within the lavas at a large scale down to complex breccia horizons and bulbous lava–sediment contacts at small scales. ‘Peperite’ like textures are found where hot lava has dynamically interacted with unconsolidated aeolian sands. Such interaction could involve lava cascading down the front of dune faces, or active ‘aa’ style flow fronts ‘bulldozing’ into and oversteepening dune faces causing rapid influx of sand into the active flow front. Resulting breccia horizons have been found up to 5 m thick. Locally, the aeolian sand is baked to a quartzite by the hot lava. In contrast, on other surfaces, the lava leaves striations in the sand as it flows across it indicating local flow directions and less pronounced interaction. In places, wind ripples and <b>topset</b> <b>beds</b> are preserved on the stoss side of the dune indicating the passive nature of emplacement for some of the lava flows. Peperites are often thought to form due to the presence of water within the unconsolidated sediments that the juvenile magma comes into contact with. However, examples from arid environments demonstrate that peperite-forming processes are diverse and may not always require water. Therefore, it is suggested that the term peperite should be used to describe deposits consisting of sediments mixed with juvenile magmatic components where it is clear {{that there has been a}} dynamic interaction between the two. This leaves the presence, or lack, of water as an issue for interpreting the processes by which the peperite formed...|$|R

The common tripartite consisting of topset, foreset and bottomset [Gilbert, G. K., 1885. The topographic features of lake shores: Washington, D. C., United States Geol. Survey, 5 th Annual Report, 69 ­ 123. ] has been identified, {{as well as the}} most distal environment consisting of turbidites, and is organised in a repetitive pattern of four main systems tracts showing a clear facies and volumetric partitioning. The first systems tract (ST 1) is characterised by the lack of <b>topset</b> <b>beds</b> {{and the development of a}} by-pass surface instead, thick foresets and bottomset beds, and thick well-developed turbiditic systems. This systems tract (ST 1) is organised in an overall progradational pattern. The second systems tract (ST 2) is characterised by a thin topset and almost no foreset equivalent. This systems tract is not always well-preserved and is organised in an overall retrograding trend with a landward shift in the position of the offlap break. The offshore is characterised by massive sandy turbidites. The third systems tract (ST 3) is characterised by small-scale deltas prograding above the staked topsets of the giant Gilbert-type fan delta. Those small Gilbert-type fan deltas are generally organised in a pure progradation evolving to an aggradational­progradational pattern. In the distal setting of those small Gilbert-type fan deltas, almost no deposits are preserved on the remaining topography of the previous Gilbert-type fan delta. The fourth systems tract (ST 4) is characterised by continuous vertically aggrading topsets that laterally pass into aggrading and prograding foresets. Bottomsets and distal turbiditic systems are starved. This fourth systems tract (ST 4) is organised in an overall aggrading trend. These giant Gilbert-type fan deltas correspond to the Middle Group of the Corinth Rift infill and their stratigraphic development was strongly influenced by evolving rift structure. They record the migration of the depocenter from the rift shoulder to the rift axis in four main sequences from ca. 1. 5 to 0. 7 Ma, related to the migration of fault activity. It is worth noting that the maximum paleobathymetry was recorded during the final stage of the progradation of the Middle Group, suggesting that the rift climax was diachronous at the scale of the entire basin. The rapid (< 1 Ma) structural and sedimentological evolution, the migration of fault activity as well as the youth of the Corinth Rift, are probably exceptional factors allowing the characterisation of such diachronism...|$|R
40|$|Lacustrine delta depositional environments {{are known}} as major targets for {{hydrocarbon}} reservoir and groundwater aquifer explorations. Outcrop-scale geophysical imaging in complex structural and stratigraphical lacustrine environments is also difficult due to extreme contrasts in physical property values, poor source and receiver coupling, and low penetration and resolution. Knowledge of geophysical imaging capabilities and outcrop-scale studies for such environments, therefore, {{are very important to}} identify structures and strata of the sediment deposits. The purposes of this thesis are to map geology of a complex stratigraphic outcrop containing poorly-consolidated unsaturated lacustrine delta sediments, to obtain subsurface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and seismic images of a well-exposed section of this outcrop, and to examine methods to improve acquisition designs and processing parameters of GPR and seismic data to increase the resolution and image quality of the data. The well-exposed outcrop is located on the Sommercamp Road, Marsing, Idaho. The site lies on the southwest side of the Western Snake River Plain, a Neogene-aged intracontinental rift basin, in southwest Idaho. The outcrop contains a 10 m exposure of an unsaturated lacustrine delta sequence with <b>topset</b> <b>beds</b> tectonically tilted 10 °, underlain by 25 ° dipping foreset sand beds with mud drapes, and cut by a near-vertical fault. Beneath the foresets are lacustrine clay sediments over an irregular rhyolite bedrock surface. I collected data using GPR and seismic reflection methods. For GPR data acquisition, I used 50, 100, and 200 MHz frequencies. I processed the GPR data using the following processing sequence: dewow, first-arrival time alignment, automatic gain control, bandpass filter, eigenvector filter, and migration. The processed 100 MHz GPR data show the best reliably images of the dipping subsurface structures of the sediments with up to the depth of 6 m using a constant velocity of 0. 12 m/ns in dry sands. The 200 MHz data show the dipping subsurface structures up to only 3 m deep using the same velocity. The 50 MHz data show the deepest signal penetration up to more than 20 m but they poorly resolve the dipping structures of the subsurface. I collected the seismic reflection data using two sources: a. 223 rifle gun and a 25 -lb sliding-dropped hammer. Seismic shot gathers from both sources show that ground roll is prominent in the shot gathers with velocities ranging from 150 - 300 m/s. Refraction analysis from the shot gathers shows that reflection velocities range from 350 - 1200 m/s. Reflections from subsurface interfaces may appear in the shot gathers with low velocities and low frequencies thus making it very difficult to distinguish reflections from the ground roll. Frequency spectra from the shot gathers of both sources show that the hammer source may contains lower reflection frequencies than the rifle sources. Due to the difficulty in satisfactorily separating the ground roll from the reflection events, I could not produce good subsurface images from the seismic data in this complex geology area...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} long-standing question regarding Mars {{history is}} whether the flat and low-lying northern plains ever hosted an ocean. The best opportunity {{to solve this problem}} is provided by stratigraphic observations of sedimentary deposits onlapping the crustal dichotomy. Here, we use high-resolution imagery and topography to analyze a branching network of inverted channel and channel lobe deposits in the Aeolis Dorsa region, just north of the dichotomy boundary. Observations of stacked, cross-cutting channel bodies and stratal geometries indicate that these landforms represent exhumed distributary channel deposits. Observations of depositional trunk feeder channel bodies, a lack of evidence for past topographic confinement, channel avulsions at similar elevations, and the presence of a strong break in dip slope between <b>topset</b> and foreset <b>beds</b> suggest that this distributary system was most likely a delta, rather than an alluvial fan or submarine fan. Sediment transport calculations using both measured and derived channel geometries indicate a minimum delta deposition time on the order of 400 [*]years. The location of this delta within a thick and widespread clastic wedge abutting the crustal dichotomy boundary, unconfined by any observable craters, suggests a standing body of water potentially 105 [*]km 2 in extent or greater and is spatially consistent with hypotheses for a northern ocean...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{physical}} oceanographic {{characteristics of the}} Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary are reviewed; these include the general pattern of water movement {{and the influence of}} high freshwater discharges on the salinity distribution. Various approaches to the problem of defining sediment transport paths in the macrotidal estuarine system, for fine grained and coarse grained material, are summarised. Transport patterns are examined, for example, through: the distribution of surficial sediments and their associated bedforms; seabed drifter studies; the analysis of tidal current and wave data, separately and in combination, because of their influence on bedload transport paths; satellite imagery, within the visible part of the spectrum; and on the basis of output from depth-averaged numerical models. Comparison between the interpretations shows that there are discrepancies and contradictions in the derived sediment transport paths. In particular, it is difficult to explain the up-channel movement of fine grained material against a background of inferred offshore movement, shown by the orientation of sandwaves and the direction of movement of the surface waters. An early model to overcome this contradiction incorporated ‘two-way differential transport’ throughout the water column. Localised contradictions in the transport paths for sand and ‘fine sediment’ occur in the inner part of the Bristol Channel. The most recent conjectural models for sediment movement incorporate an ebb- dominated zone along the central axis of the Channel, together with flood-dominated coastal zones. This lateral variation in transport paths, across the Channel, constrasts with the earlier proposition for vertical differentiation; it is suggested by seabed drifter recovery patterns and confirmed by the output from one of the numerical models. Transport towards the flood-dominated zones at the boundaries is enhanced under the superimposed influence of waves, which is demonstrated through the use of sediment transport formulae and sand tracer experiments. Although the annual contribution of the rivers to the overall sediment budget is shown to be small, the time of retention of waters and sediment within the system could result in fluviatile sediment inputs being retained for tens of years. In an attempt to extrapolate observations of transport processes into the ancient record, a preliminary facies model for the macrotidal Bristol Channel is presented. The model shows the availability of sand increasing in an onshore direction; progressing in this direction, the facies pass from scoured bedrock and lag deposits, through cross bedded megaripple foresets and the <b>topset</b> planar <b>bedding</b> of intertidal flats, to Holocene fill and supratidal deposits...|$|R

The Plio-Pleistocene marine lower Saugus Formation is well {{exposed in}} the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. The lower Saugus is composed mostly of interfingering sandstone, coquinite, and conglomerate deposits, with rare occurrences of intrasparrudite limestone and laminated mudstone. The beds unconformably overlie the Miocene Modelo Formation {{throughout most of}} the study area. The lower Saugus, in the study area, is interpreted to represent a fluvial-dominated delta that is herein named the "Simi Delta". Lithosomes interpreted to be prodelta deposits include clast-supported phosphorite conglomerate and intensely bioturbated, fine to medium sandstone. Delta-front deposits include bedded medium sandstone, serpulid-bearing sandstone, and oyster-pecten coquinites. Distributary-mouth bar deposits are composed of well sorted, parallel-laminated, medium sandstone. Interdistributary bay deposits are composed of poorly sorted, silty, fine sandstone and commonly contain abundant macrofossils. A laminated, lensoidal mudstone, exposed in the Gillibrand Quarry area, is interpreted to represent an abandoned channel which was filled with clay. In Browns Canyon, an angular discordance which is interpreted to represent the transition between <b>topset</b> and foreset <b>beds</b> on a Gilbert-type delta is exposed stable or slightly emergent. This Gilbert-type delta requires a tectonic regime to form. In the Gillibrand Quarry area, where distributary-mouth bar deposits are exposed, a subsiding receiving basin is required. This difference in tectonic regimes suggests that the "Simi Delta" consisted of at least two different delta lobes, which were formed at two different times. Provenance includes an igneous, a high-rank metamorphic, and a reworked sedimentary source. The presence of anorthosite and gneissic clasts indicates that during the Plio-Pleistocene, the San Gabriel Mountain complex was a highland and was shedding these distinctive clasts into the westward-flowing Plio-Pleistocene Santa Clara River which deposited its sediment on the "Simi Delta". Between 1, 000, 000 and 70, 000 years before present, the Santa Susana Mountains were uplifted causing the Pleistocene Santa Clara River to shift to its present course and abandon the "Simi Delta" depositional site...|$|R
