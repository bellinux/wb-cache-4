In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation.

50|$|The {{practice}} of traitor tracing {{is most often}} implemented with computer software, and evolved from the previous method of activation codes. In this model, each box of software ships with a unique activation number on a sticker or label {{that can only be}} read after the package is opened, separate from the CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM. This number is an encoded serial number, expanded to a usually large number or string of numbers, digits, and hyphens. When the software is being installed, or the first time it is run, the user is prompted to type in the license code. This code is then decoded back to its base serial number. This process reduces the number in complexity, and the additional information removed by this process is used to verify the authenticity of the serial number. If the user mistypes a single character in what is sometimes a very long code, the software will refuse to install and require the number <b>to</b> be <b>retyped</b> until it is correct.|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{characterized}} by typical extrapyramidal motor features and increasingly recognized non-motor symptoms such as working memory (WM) deficits. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), we investigated differences in neuronal activation during a motor WM task in 23 non-demented PD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants had <b>to</b> memorize and <b>retype</b> variably long visuo-spatial stimulus sequences after short or long delays (immediate or delayed serial recall). PD patients showed deficient WM performance compared to controls, which was accompanied by reduced encoding-related activation in WM-related regions. Mirroring slower motor initiation and execution, reduced activation in motor structures such as the basal ganglia and superior parietal cortex was detected for both immediate and delayed recall. Increased activation in limbic, parietal and cerebellar regions was found during delayed recall only. Increased load-related activation for delayed recall was found in the posterior midline and the cerebellum. Overall, our results demonstrate that impairment of WM in PD is primarily associated with a widespread reduction of task-relevant activation, whereas additional parietal, limbic and cerebellar regions become more activated relative to matched controls. While the reduced WM-related activity mirrors the deficient WM performance, the additional recruitment may point to either dysfunctional compensatory strategies or detrimental crosstalk from "default-mode" regions, contributing to the observed impairment...|$|R

This gave the effect of command line recall and editing even if the operating system did not support it. For example, when working at an operating system's command prompt, an erroneous command could quickly be corrected and re-sent without having <b>to</b> <b>retype</b> the entire line. This was possible in many terminals of the day, but the HP 2640 was smart enough to only retransmit the line from the first character typed by the user, omitting, for example, the operating system's command prompt. This was later implemented as [...] "line mode". Another method was to paint a formatted with protected fields within a screen in character mode and place it into local edit mode similar to the above but the user did not know. This meant that the characters entered by the user would not be transmitted to the host until a 'special' key, typically the enter key, but other keys were also deemed special (i.e. immediate interrupt of the host) such as control y and function keys. Only the data within the unprotected areas would be transferred in this way, using a semi block mode mechanism, a sort of half way house between block mode and normal character mode, Formatted fields also meant forms could be stored in memory ( [...] tested for and recalled locally or repainted from the host if not present), just the unprotected data areas need be sent, thereby removing the need to repaint or issue direct cursor placements in order to update the screen (TIM/3000 Air Call Computer Systems).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the research undertaken {{to investigate the}} optimal implementation of text prediction. Using a 16. 7 Tb large dataset, a double-blind experiment is executed with 156 participants which predicts up to 4 words ahead what a user is typing. Following the main research question: Which User Interface Configuration Supports an Optimal Implementation of Text Prediction in Physical Keyboard Supported Software? several hypotheses are defined. The optimal implementation {{is defined as the}} text prediction system that leads to the least errors over the shortest time it takes a participant <b>to</b> <b>retype</b> a text. The results show that that optimal implementation is no text prediction. The text prediction system used for the experiment made users type more errors and it took users more time <b>to</b> <b>retype</b> a text with the system enabled than without. A significant result was found in the influence of the user interface used and the amount of words predicted. There are in total four user interfaces tested, and the autofill interface, among many familiar from Google’s search bar, results in the least amount of errors typed. However, even with this interface enabled,typing without text prediction results in significantly less errors. The amount of words predicted varies from 0 (the words being typed is completed by the system) to 4 (the word being typed is completed and four additional words are predicted). With three words predicted, the amount of errors typed is the lowest. But likewise to the user interface, the control experiment without prediction performs significantly better. It is from these results that the author can only conclude that the optimal implementation of text prediction is no text prediction. In further research, the author presents an inverted way of text prediction which might increase the accuracy of the predictions, and a longitudinal study to further understand the significant results...|$|E

It outlines psychological impact of health changes for human being and explains their effect to quality of life, detect strategy of successfulageing, prosperity and age dignity. Further directs its focus to analyse all ranges of social issues (e. g. loneliness, non self-reliance, intergenerational relations not only within the family, etc.) which seniors are struggling or may encounter with changes of their health situation. Conclusion of piecework is devoted to methodology (empirical part of work) which aims to determine the views and attitudes of seniors to own health situation and health determinants (age, genetic predisposition, current disease, ache, health difficulties, etc.) which influence forming these attitudes.

40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} {{juvenile}} offenders´ motivation for crime. In the theoretical part the basic terminology relating to this issued and considered {{essential for the}} issue description is introduced. Futhermore, the criminal activity of juveniles is characterized and {{the current state of}} the issue is described. The criminogenous factors leading to criminal activity are defined. These are divided into endogenous and exogenous. The final part of the theoretical part deals with motivation for criminal activity. The main goal/topic of my thesis was to illustrate motivation of juvenile offenders for criminal activity. To a thorough understanding and determination of the issue, sub-objectives were set { [...] } to identify endogenous causes of crime commiting by juvenile offenders, and comparison of individual offenders and evaluation of their readiness to commit crime. The research questions corresponded with the goals stated. The research was conducted by a qualitative method. The respondents were received through a purpose selection by the PMS institution. To obtain the data, the moderated semi-structured interview technique was chosen. The interviews were recorded using a dictaphone to make the most accurate analysis, and then <b>retyped</b> <b>to</b> a verbatim transcript. To analyze the data the anchored theory method was applied. Coding is based on the principles of the theory. I have used open coding. There were ten juvenile crime offenders who took part in this research as respondents. The research has shown the existence of a few problematic areas that provide grounds for criminal activities. As the fundamental areas have proved to be an inadequate family background and inappropriately spent free time in connection with members of a gang. The research outcomes revealed that the main (dominant) motif was fun and entertainment. Secondary (not frequent) motif was financial profit. The research results have also shown that these offenders tend to commit crime under the influence of alcohol and friends. I believe that my work has revealed new evidence surprising for many people. And that is that criminal activity of juveniles has been declining, being rather a marginal phenomenon (juvenile crime makes up only 2 % of the total crime rate), and brutality and severity of offences commited by juveniles does not reach such a gravity as it is presented by the media. I would like to recommend the results of the thesis to be used as a basis for a preventive action in the field of juvenile delinquency. Due to the findings, more efficient and effective preventive programs could be set up to eliminate this socio-pathological phenomenon so that a favourable social climate could be established...|$|R

After being tested for their native language, English-native participants were instructed <b>to</b> <b>retype</b> stimuli as quickly and as accurately as they could. The participants were informed that the system was keeping a score based on accuracy and speed, and that a high score {{would result in a}} position on a public scoreboard.

Responses were recorded and compared to the original stimuli. Responses that differed from the stimuli were considered a typographical or spelling error, and added to an error corpus. Collecting a corpus using a game offers several unique benefits. 1) A game attracts engaged participants, quickly. 2) The web-based delivery reduces the cost and decreases the time and effort of collecting the corpus. 3) Participants have fun. Spelling error corpora have been difficult and expensive to obtain for many languages and this research was performed to fill this gap.

As computer algebra systems have evolved, it is natural to use {{more and more to}} the abstract method. The following code is pretty condensed. I feel that compact code is in general also faster to grasp. If you should not agree, it should be easy to rearrange the individual procedures. It can help to look under the hood. The first routines compute the dimension of an arbitrary graph. Mathematica already knows how to compute the unit ball. We have to take away the vertex itself to get the unit sphere. Dimension is then defined inductively as 1 plus the average of the dimensions of the unit spheres. At the end we include an example on how to call the routine. It produces a list of the local dimensions of a random graph with 15 vertices and 40 edges...|$|E
30|$|When {{the above}} {{conditions}} are applied several advantages become apparent, {{based on the}} principle of not needing <b>to</b> <b>retype</b> information. For items in the robot, there is no scope to make a dispensing error, improving patient safety; the process is much more efficient, and the skill mix of staff can be adjusted within the dispensary. As a consequence of all of the above, the speed of the prescription dispensing process increases dramatically. Another consequence of integrating electronic prescribing with a robot is that the purchasing of medicines needs to be given consideration so that items with appropriate bar codes are purchased, to ensure there is a direct link between product, robot and he electronic prescribing system. There is also a change in the professional model at Hospital A, as the dispensary pharmacist is no longer in complete control of the dispensing going on in the dispensary. This has wider implications for professional practice. The professional dispensing expertise is replaced to some extent by a systems approach. This allows flexibility in where dispensing is triggered (60 % of the time at ward level by other pharmacists to dispensary pharmacist). It also allows pharmacists to maintain being at ward level rather than having {{to come back to the}} dispensary to help dispense. The ability to have ‘instantaneous dispensing’ means there is more time for the pharmacists to devote to the clinical care of the patient, and thereby doing more ‘value added’ clinical roles.|$|E
