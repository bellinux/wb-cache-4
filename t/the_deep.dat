But <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>the</b> network is, the more difficult it is to train, which means <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>the</b> neural network is more difficult to train. That is, the neural network has a “degeneration” phenomenon. It also means <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> neural network will have a higher training error and test error than the shallow network.

He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form the coma of Tempel 1.
