All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer.

25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, the Oakland Seals were in {{financial}} difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL did not want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and vetoed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise {{for the price of}} $6million (three times the cost in 1967). The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the 1970–71 season.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Hibbard-Swenson Company {{chartered}} {{the newly}} built motor schooner King & Winge to carry relief {{supplies to the}} Belvedere and complete the normal trading run. King & Winge became stuck in the ice near Point Barrow and bent her propeller. The ship was extricated by the revenue cutter Bear on August 22. They met the Belvedere at Point Barrow, delivered the supplies, took on some crewmen from the Elvira, and subsequently put into at Nome August 30. Bear arrived the same day and reported that its attempt to rescue {{the crew of the}} Karluk from Wrangel Island off the northeast Siberian coast had been thwarted by bad weather, ice and low fuel. Stefansson's former secretary Burt McConnell then requested that King & Winge attempt a rescue; this request was reiterated by Captain Bartlett of the Karluk. Swenson set out for Wrangel Island in the King & Winge with A.P. Jochimsen as Master. They stopped at East Cape, Siberia, and picked up an umiak and a party of natives to man it, in case they had to cross ice interspersed with open water. As they approached the beach in the umiak, the native crew was alarmed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Karluk survivors vigorously pumping a rifle, but Swenson reassured them in their language. They removed a total of twelve expedition survivors from two separate camps. The survivors included an Inupiaq couple and their two children. The survivors were later transferred to the Bear.|$|E

He was sent to the Naval Training Station in North Chicago, where he was still a student when World War I came to an end. He {{achieved}} the rank of seaman second class, but never went to sea, and was discharged in February 1919. John Tracy's desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma. Studies at two more institutions, plus the additional allowance of [...] "war credits", won Tracy a place at Ripon College. He entered Ripon in February 1921, declaring his intention to major in medicine.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the backing}} of his home state, Pierce faced {{obstacles}} in gaining the nomination, as he had not held elective office in a decade, and lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be [...] "utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their own elected, knew that his position as a party leader would be endangered if he was unwilling to run. Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, {{with the understanding that}} his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

500|$|In November 1895, Republican John Griggs {{was elected}} {{governor}} of New Jersey; his campaign was managed by Hobart. [...] The election of New Jersey's first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation {{in the newspapers}} that Hobart would {{be a candidate for}} vice president. [...] New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart, both <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their own possibly elevated to national office, and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey. [...] Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state, and the Griggs victory showed that Republicans could hope to win New Jersey's electoral votes, which they had not done since 1872. [...] Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign.|$|E

When the war began she {{was estimated to be}} 21.19% complete, with [...] of steel assembled on the slip. She was only lightly damaged by German air attacks and bombardments, and, as some material had been used during the Siege of Leningrad, she was estimated to be 19.5% complete {{after the end of the}} war. Some thought was given to completing her, but this was opposed as she was regarded as obsolete in light of the experience gained during the war. Stalin's expressed desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Project 23-class ships completed only delayed the decision to scrap her; this was ordered on 29 May 1948 and was well underway by April 1949.|$|E

Video game insiders linked the poor reception of the game to the departure of Brian Miller in his role as the Senior Vice President of Paramount, as he had been heavily involved in the marketing for the game.

500|$|Back in Scranton, {{the party}} {{planning}} continues to go poorly. Dwight publicly and loudly confronts Kelly about {{her time in}} juvenile hall, {{which turns out to}} be for stealing the boat of an ex-boyfriend when she was 14. Kelly also declares she hates the cake Jim picked for her, which is completely blank; he later decorates it and spells her name incorrectly as [...] "Kelley". When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to think of anything. They finally settle on offering her one hour of napping or one hour of watching television. She loves the idea and chooses the nap. Meanwhile, Angela appears much happier than usual because she bought a new $7,000 cat with the money she received from selling Andy's engagement ring. She has also set up a nanny cam so she can monitor the cats from work. However, she is horrified <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her other cats having sex with the new cat, and rushes home to stop it. Later, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar (Oscar Nunez) watch Angela arrive home on the nanny cam screen, and become disgusted when Angela starts licking the cat to help clean it. Angela eventually returns to work and coughs up a hairball. Oscar claims the image will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
