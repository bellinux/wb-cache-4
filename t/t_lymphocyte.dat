Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (<b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte)</b> mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E

However, the nature of opioids produced by T cells is still matter of debate in mice. Whereas β-endorphin has been found in <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by using antibody-based methods, messenger RNA (mRNA) quantification shows mainly mRNA encoding for enkephalins. The objective of the study is to elucidate the nature of T cell-derived opioids responsible for analgesia and clarify discrepancy of the results at the protein and genetic levels. MethodsCD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were isolated from wild-type and enkephalin-deficient mice. mRNA encoding for β-endorphin and enkephalin was quantified by RT-qPCR. The binding of commercially available polyclonal anti-endorphin antibodies to lymphocytes from wild-type or enkephalin knockout mice was assessed by cytofluorometry. Opioid-mediated analgesic properties of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from wild-type and enkephalin-deficient mice were compared in a model of inflammation-induced somatic pain by measuring sensitivity to mechanical stimuli using calibrated von Frey filaments. ResultsCD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> expressed high level of mRNA encoding for enkephalins but not for β-endorphin in mice. Anti-β-endorphin polyclonal IgG antibodies are specific for β-endorphin but cross-react with enkephalins. Anti-β-endorphin polyclonal antibodies bound to wild-type but not enkephalin-deficient CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Endogenous regulation of inflammatory pain by wild-type <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was completely abolished when <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were deficient in enkephalins. Pain behavior of immune-deficient (i. e., without B and <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes)</b> mice was superimposable to that of mice transferred with enkephalin-deficient lymphocytes. ConclusionsRabbit polyclonal anti-β-endorphin serum IgG bind to CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> because of their cross-reactivity towards enkephalins. Thus, staining of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by anti-β-endorphin polyclonal IgG reported in most of studies in mice is because of their binding to enkephalins.

Because systemic inflammation is also a component of emphysema, we hypothesize that peripheral CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of emphysematous smokers who show evidence of systemic inflammation will have higher expression of cytotoxic molecules. Methods We assessed parameters of systemic inflammation in normal individuals (smokers or non-smokers) and in emphysematous subjects with an active smoking history by measuring serum interleukine- 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor. Expression of perforin, granzyme B, and FasL protein by CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and natural killer cells were assessed by flow cytometry while perforin, granzyme B, and FasL mRNA expression were measured on purified systemic CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by real-time PCR.

Even with the presence of systemic inflammation in emphysematous smokers, the percentage of peripheral CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and NK cells expressing perforin and granzyme B protein was not different between the three groups. Conclusion Despite evidence of systemic inflammation, peripheral <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of emphysematous smokers did not show higher levels of cytotoxic markers, suggesting that increase of activated <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the emphysematous lung may be due to either activation in the lung or specific peripheral recruitment. </p...|$|R
