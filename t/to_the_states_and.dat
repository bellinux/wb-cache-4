5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>and</b> federal criminal investigations were less {{common in the}} first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E

5|$|Ted Williams, {{whose mother}} was of Mexican {{heritage}} enlisted on May 22, 1942. Williams received his wings and commission in the Marine Corps on May 2, 1944. He was in Hawaii awaiting orders {{as a replacement}} pilot when the war ended. Williams returned to the States in December 1945 and was discharged from the Marines on January 28, 1946. On May 2, 1952, Williams was recalled to active duty due to the Korean War. After completing jet refresher training in the F9F Panther at Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams joined VMF-311 in Korea. He flew 37 combat missions and had a narrow escape when he crash-landed a flak-damaged aircraft. Among the decorations he received was the Air Medal with two Gold Stars for meritorious achievement. Williams returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> relieved from active duty with the rank of captain on July 28, 1953. Williams, who played professional baseball with the Boston Red Sox, was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1966.|$|E

Board of Education, the court incorporated the establishment clause, determining that it applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> that a law enabling reimbursement for busing to all schools (including parochial schools) was constitutional.|$|E

25|$|The {{goods and}} {{services}} tax (GST) is a value-added tax introduced in Australia in 2000, which is collected by the Australian Tax Office. The revenue is then redistributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> territories via the Commonwealth Grants Commission process. In essence, this is Australia's program of horizontal fiscal equalisation. Whilst the rate is currently set at 10%, there are many domestically consumed items that are effectively zero-rated (GST-free) such as fresh food, education, and health services, certain medical products, as well as exemptions for Government charges and fees that are themselves {{in the nature of}} taxes.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1975, {{the band}} had become disillusioned with {{their lack of}} success in America.

According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately £45,000 at the time. Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Black Sabbath, only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 2012, it was {{announced}} that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally Financial, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.|$|E

She did not repeat her indoor success, however, as her arms collided with Michelle Perry in the semi-finals and fell, missing out on the opportunity to compete at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. Vowing to salvage her season, she returned to Europe to compete on the major World Athletics Tour meets, but she only finished seventh and eighth in Oslo and Lausanne. She returned to form in Rethymno, beating Priscilla Lopes-Schliep and Damu Cherry with a world-leading time of 12.47seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{healthcare}} reform {{debate in the}} United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. Following the election of Barack Obama as president, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. However, {{in the next election}} of Donald Trump as president, he campaigned to repeal and replace Obamacare {{and came up with a}} seven-point plan for {{healthcare reform}}. With this seven point plan President Trump discussed that the healthcare system would work based on free market principles. According to Ballotpedia, he stated that he would repeal Obamacare, reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance, institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals, make Health Saving Accounts inheritable, require price transparency, block-grant Medicaid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>and</b> allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers. Trump added that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, this seven point plan has not taken the place of Obamacare, and it is possible that Obamacare will not be repealed but instead it will be modified so that all parts of this plan work accordingly.|$|E
