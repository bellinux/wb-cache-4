40|$|Background: Translational {{research}} in medicine requires researchers {{to identify the}} steps to transfer basic scientific discoveries from laboratory benches to bedside decision-making, and eventually into clinical practice. On a parallel track, philosophical work in ethics has not been obliged to identify the steps to translate theoretical conclusions into adequate practice. The medical ethicist A. Cribb suggested some years ago {{that it is now}} time to debate ‘the business of translational’ in medical ethics. Despite the very interesting and useful perspective on the field of medical ethics launched by Cribb, the debate is still missing. In this paper, I take up Cribb’s invitation and discuss further analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice. Discussion: The analytic distinctions needed to base an ethics aiming to translate between theory and practice are identified as ‘movements of translation’. I explore briefly what would constitute success and limitations to these intended <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> by addressing the challenges of the epistemological gap between philosophical and practical ethics. The categories of <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> I suggest can serve {{as a starting point for}} a systematic, collective self-inspection and discussion of the merits and limitations of the various academic and practical activities that bioethicists are engaged in. I further propose that translational ethics could be considered as a new discipline of ethical work constructively structured around compositions of <b>translational</b> <b>movements.</b> Summary: Breaking the idea of translational ethics into distinct <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> provide us with a nuanced set of conditions to explore and discuss the justification and limitations of various efforts carried out in the field of bioethics. In this sense, the proposed framework could be a useful vehicle for augmented collective, self-reflexivity among both philosophers and practitioners who are ‘doing bioethics’. Also, carefully designed, overall approaches combining justified, self-reflexive philosophical and practical efforts according to the suggested distinctions could be expected to realise – or at least improve a facilitation of – translation of ethics across the theory-practice gap. </p...|$|R

40|$|We present kinematics, actuation, {{detailed}} design, characterization {{results and}} initial user evaluations of AssistOn-Knee, a novel self-aligning active exoskeleton for robot-assisted knee rehabilitation. AssistOn-Knee can, not only assist flexion/extension {{movements of the}} knee joint but also accommodate its <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> in the sagittal plane. Automatically aligning its joint axes, AssistOn-Knee enables an ideal match between human knee axis and the exoskeleton axis, guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy. Self-aligning feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the exoskeleton, allowing more effective time spent on exercises. The proposed exoskeleton actively controls the rotational degree of freedom of the knee through a Bowden cable-driven series elastic actuator, while the <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> of the knee joints are passively accommodated through use of a 3 degrees of freedom planar parallel mechanism. AssistOn-Knee possesses a lightweight and compact design with significantly low apparent inertia, thanks to its Bowden cable based transmission that allows remote location of the actuator and reduction unit. Furthermore, thanks to its series-elastic actuation, AssistOn-Knee enables high-fidelity force control and active backdrive-ability within its control bandwidth, while featuring passive elasticity for excitations above this bandwidth, ensuring safety and robustness throughout the whole frequency spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{structures}} its optic flow during flight by interspersing <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> with abrupt body rotations. Whether these ‘body saccades’ {{are accompanied}} by steering movements of the head {{is a matter of}} debate. By tracking single flies moving freely in an arena, we now discovered that walking Drosophila also perform saccades. Movement analysis revealed that the flies separate rotational from <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> by quickly turning their bodies by 15 degrees within a tenth of a second. Although walking flies moved their heads by up to 20 degrees about their bodies, their heads moved with the bodies during saccadic turns. This saccadic strategy contrasts with the head saccades reported for e. g. blowflies and honeybees, presumably reflecting optical constraints: modelling revealed that head saccades as described for these latter insects would hardly affect the retinal input in Drosophila because of the lower acuity of its compound eye. The absence of head saccades in Drosophila was associated with the absence of haltere oscillations, which seem to guide head movements in other flies. In addition to adding new twists to Drosophila walking behavior, our analysis shows that Drosophila does not turn its head relative to its body when turning during walking...|$|R

40|$|Capping {{of surface}} Ig by anti-Ig {{antibodies}} involves a membrane perturbation requiring an energy-dependent step. Lymphocytes treated with anti-Ig are stimulated to move. Previously, we {{had shown that}} movement was not essential for capping, although it influenced the localization of the cap. We have investigated the role of cell movement and of microtubular proteins in this phenomenon. Treatment of B lymphocytes with colchicine does not affect capping of Ig nor does it affect the increase in <b>translational</b> <b>movement</b> produced by anti-Ig antibodies. Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin B stops <b>translational</b> <b>movement</b> and may affect capping to some degree under appropriate circumstances. Lymphocytes treated with both drugs are impaired in capping. We surmise {{that there may be}} two cytoplasmic events regulating directly or indirectly capping: one associated with the process of <b>translational</b> <b>movement,</b> the other associated with the activity of microtubules. Lymphocytes treated with concanavalin A do not cap Ig. Colchicine reverses this inhibition. Certain experimental procedures antagonize the colchicine effect, the most striking of which is the use of cytochalasin B. Colchicine appears to increase movement of the Con A-treated lymphocyte, and this increased movement appears responsible for the accumulation of complexes to the posterior part of the cell.

40|$|Honeybees use {{visual cues}} to {{relocate}} profitable food sources and their hive. What bees see while navigating, {{depends on the}} appearance of the cues, the bee’s current position, orientation and movement relative to them. Here we analyse the detailed flight behaviour during the localisation of a goal surrounded by cylinders that are characterised either by a high contrast in luminance and texture or by mostly motion contrast relative to the background. By relating flight behaviour {{to the nature of the}} information available from these landmarks, we aim to identify behavioural strategies that facilitate the processing of visual information during goal localisation. We decompose flight behaviour into prototypical movements using clustering algorithms in order to reduce the behavioural complexity. The determined prototypical movements reflect the honeybee’s saccadic flight pattern that largely separates rotational from <b>translational</b> <b>movements.</b> During phases of <b>translational</b> <b>movements</b> between fast saccadic rotations, the bees can gain information about the three dimensional layout of their environment from the translational optic flow. The prototypical movements reveal the prominent role of sideways and up- or downward movements, which can help bees to gather information about objects, particularly in the frontal visual field. We find that the occurrence of specific prototypes depends on the bees’ distance from the landmarks and the feeder and that changing the texture of the landmarks evokes different prototypical movements. The adaptive use of different behavioural prototypes shapes the visual input and can facilitate information processing in the bees’ visual system during local navigation...|$|R
