40|$|Applications {{typically}} have some local {{understanding of a}} database schema, a virtual database that may differ significantly from the actual schema of the data where it is stored. Application engineers often support a virtual database using custom-built middleware because the available solutions, including updatable views, are unable to express necessary capabilities. We propose an alternative means of mapping a virtual database to a physical database that guarantees they remain synchronized under data or schema updates against the virtual schema. One constructs a mapping by composing channel transformations (CTs) that encapsulate atomic transformations — including complex transformations such as pivoting — with known updatability properties. Applications, query interfaces, and any other services can behave as if the virtual database is the implemented schema. We describe how CTs translate queries, DML, <b>and</b> <b>DDL,</b> <b>and</b> the properties that are necessary for such translation to be correct.

40|$|BackgroundVancomycin-resistant enterococci are {{pathogenic}} {{bacteria that}} attenuate antibiotic sensitivity by producing peptidoglycan precursors that terminate in d-Ala-d-lactate rather than d-Ala-d-Ala. A key enzyme in effecting antibiotic resistance is the metallodipeptidase VanX, which reduces the cellular pool of the d-Ala-d-Ala dipeptide. ResultsWe constructed eleven mutants, using the recently determined VanX structure as a basis, to investigate residue function. Mutating Aspt 42 or Ser 114 showed a large effect principally on KM, consistent with roles {{in recognition of}} the d-Ala-d-Ala termini. The drastic reduction or absence of activity in the Arg 71 mutants correlates with a role in the stabilization of an anionic tetrahedral transition state. Three residues of the Escherichia colid-Ala-d-Ala ligase (Ddl), Glu 15, Ser 281 and Arg 255, are similarly conserved and have equivalent functions with respect to VanX, consistent with a convergent evolution of active sites to bind d-Ala-d-Ala and lower energy barriers for formation of the tetrahedral intermediate and transition states. In the N-acyl-d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase VanY, all active-site residues are conserved (except for the two responsible for recognition of the dipeptide amino terminus). ConclusionsThe mutagenesis results support structure-based functional predictions and explain why the VanX dipeptidase <b>and</b> <b>Ddl</b> ligase show narrow specificity for the d,d-dipeptide substrate. The results reveal that VanX <b>and</b> <b>Ddl,</b> two enzymes that use the same substrate but proceed in opposite directions driven by distinct cofactors (zinc versus ATP), evolved similar architectural solutions to substrate recognition and catalysis acceleration. VanY sequence analysis predicts an active site and mechanism of reaction similar to VanX...|$|R
40|$|D-Cycloserine (DCS) targets the {{peptidoglycan}} biosynthetic enzymes D-alanine racemase (Alr) and Dalanine: D-alanine ligase (Ddl). Previously, we {{demonstrated that}} the overproduction of Alr in Mycobacterium smegmatis determines a DCS resistance phenotype. In this study, we investigated the roles of both Alr <b>and</b> <b>Ddl</b> in the mechanisms of action of and resistance to DCS in M. smegmatis. We found that the overexpression of either the M. smegmatis or the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ddl gene in M. smegmatis confers resistance to DCS, but at lower levels than the overexpression of the alr gene. Furthermore, a strain overexpressing both the alr <b>and</b> <b>ddl</b> genes displayed an eightfold-higher level of resistance. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of Alr by DCS decreases the intracellular pool of D-alanine, we determined the alanine pools in M. smegmatis wild-type and recombinant strains with or without DCS treatment. Alr-overproducing strain GPM 14 cells not exposed to DCS displayed almost equimolar amounts of L- and D-alanine in the steady state. The wild-type strain and Ddl-overproducing strains contained a twofold excess of L- over D-alanine. In all strains, DCS treatment led to a significant accumulation of L-alanine and a concomitant decease of D-alanine, with approximately a 20 -fold excess of L-alanine in the Ddl-overproducing strains. These data suggest that Ddl is not significantly inhibited by DCS at concentrations that inhibit Alr. This study is of significance for {{the identification of the}} lethal target(s) of DCS and the development of novel drugs targeting the D-alanine branch of mycobacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Seven new 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-phenylalanine {{derivatives}} were synthesized {{in order}} to investigate {{the effect of the}} amino acid chirality on the gelating properties of these small molecules in water. Gelation tests have shown that enantiomerically pure homochiral 1, 3, 5 -cyclohexyl-tricarboxamide-L-phenylalanine is a non-hydrogelator as it crystallizes from water, whereas the heterochiral derivatives with either two L-phenylalanine moieties and one D-phenylalanine (LLD), or vice versa (DDL), are very good hydrogelators. Concentration-dependent gel-to-sol transition-temperature (T-gs) curves for LLD or DDL gels show a siamoidal behaviour, which is in contrast to the logarithmic curves generally observed for gels derived from low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs). Such sigmoidal behaviour can be related to interactions between fibre bundles, which give rise to intertwined bundles of fibres. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of LLD <b>and</b> <b>DDL</b> gels show a network of thin, unbranched, fibre bundles with diameters of 20 nm. Right-handed twisted fibre bundles are present in the LLD gel, whereas left-handed structures can be found in tile DDL gel. Each bundle of fibres consists of a finite number of primary fibres. Gels consisting of mixtures of gelators, LLD <b>and</b> <b>DDL,</b> <b>and</b> nongelators (LLL or DDD) were investigated by means of T-gs measurements, CID spectroscopy and TEM. Results show that the incorporation of nongelator molecules into gel fibres occurs; this leads to higher T-gs values and to changes in the helicity of the fibre bundles. Furthermore, it was found that peripheral functionalization of the homochiral derivatives LLL or DDD by means of a second amino acid or a hydrophilic moiety can overcome the effect of chirality; this process in turn leads to good hydrogelators...|$|R

Homogeneous evolutionary rates of descendant clades from the common ancestor (the node) were tested with delta-shift statistics (Δ 1 and Δ 2) at all nodes (Moore et al. 2004). One million random resolutions with 1000 TSI/ERM-resolved trees under one-million ERM simulations were performed to identify significant diversification rate shifts of each node. We selected the best diversification rate model (rate-constant, RC, or rate-variable, RV) through ∆AICRC test statistics using the fitdAICrc function of R package laser ver. 2.3 (Rabosky 2006).

Docking studies were performed for 34 compounds in order to evaluate their affinity to bacterial proteins that are known targets for some antibiotics with different mechanism of action: inhibitors of cell wall synthesis, inhibitors of protein synthesis, inhibitors of nucleic acids synthesis and antimetabolites. After validation of the molecular docking approach, virtual screening of all the compounds was performed against penicillin binding protein 1 a (PBP 1 a), alanine racemase (Alr), d-alanyl-d-alanine synthetase (Ddl), isoleucyl-tRNA sinthetase (IARS), DNA gyrase subunit B, topoisomerase IV (TopoIV), dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) using AutoDock 4.

Because the owners of DNL {{were not able to}} hold meetings and the airline inactive, and {{in part because of the}} transfer of Norwegian negotiation power to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board, DNL did not attempt to procure any aircraft. Still, negotiations continued between the flag carriers, and DNL stated in 1944 that they were interested in procuring some aircraft.

Among the issues was the distribution of ownership: DDL suggested a 40% stake for SILA <b>and</b> 30% for <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> DNL, with the latter two granting Aero 10% if they should join; DNL proposed an equal ownership between the three.|$|R

30|$|The second {{significant}} {{factor is the}} methodology, that is, how DDL is implemented. There are generally two ways to adopt DDL approach, namely, direct <b>DDL</b> <b>and</b> indirect <b>DDL</b> (Yoon <b>and</b> Jo 2014). In direct DDL, learners consult corpora directly for solving language problems; whereas indirect DDL refers to learners’ use of paper-based concordance lines extracted by teachers or researchers. Direct DDL is the dominant paradigm in previous studies (Yoon and Hirvela 2004; Yoon 2008; Gaskell and Cobb 2004; Gilmore 2009; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Pérez-Paredes et al. 2012; Chang 2014; Tono et al. 2014; Cotos 2014), but recently {{there are also a}} lot of studies employing indirect DDL such as Boulton (2009, 2010), Huang (2014), Smart (2014), etc. These studies have shown that both direct <b>and</b> indirect <b>DDL</b> have their own distinctive advantages and disadvantages. To compare the effectiveness of the two ways, Yoon and Jo (2014) conducted a small-scale study investigating their different effects on L 2 learners’ error correction in a writing class. This study revealed that the self-correction rate was higher in indirect DDL than in the direct DDL for most learners, especially for lower-level learners; however, direct DDL activities may have more positive effects on learner autonomy especially for higher-level learners. Thus it could be found that indirect DDL is more appropriate for lower-level or novice learners, which is consistent with Gaskell and Cobb’s (2004) viewpoint that indirect DDL is a transitional step to direct DDL.|$|R
