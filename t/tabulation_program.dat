40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the differences between}} 1981 Ball State University undeclared and declared major matriculates freshmen on selected variables related to persistence. This study {{did not attempt to}} make forecasts regarding persistence by the study participants, but rather to serve as a base population from which longitudinal studies examining the relationship between declaration of a major and persistence could be based. Responses to a 60 -item questionnaire were tabulated and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. A cross <b>tabulation</b> <b>program</b> was used in generating frequency and percentage data. In addition, chi square and T-test programs were used in reviewing the statistical significance of the differences. The undeclared and declared students were found to differ significantly in thier responses to the following variables: 1) college attendance by others; 2) influence to attend college; 3) Ball State University attendance; 4) major/occupation selection priority; and 5) vocational and academic expectations and experiences.

40|$|The {{database}} {{constructed in}} this study enables us to input quantitative data related to crystallographic orientation to elucidate the properties of change of crystallographic orientation during bending of fine-grained materials. The obtained results are summarized as follows; (1) A crystal orientation <b>tabulation</b> <b>program</b> was produced. The crystallographic orientation distribution on the ND plane was computed quantitatively using Euler angle data acquired from SEM-EBSD analysis, so that quantitative data can be input into a database. (2) A devised algorithm was created, which can input combined data sets of the texture accumulation ratio and IPF figure of crystallographic orientation to three specific orientations of[001], [101], and [111], and the quantitative data of springback. (3) To date, 75 data of about 22. 3 MB, including 37 data of purecopper, 25 data of pure aluminum, and 13 data of various steels, have been stored in the database.

30|$|To {{represent}} {{and measure}} commercial competencies {{in the field}} of VET a test environment named ALUSIM was developed. It is a simulation of an industrial company that produces extruded aluminum products, such as beverage cans (see also, Winther and Achtenhagen 2009, first edition; Winther 2010). The assessment is designed {{in such a way that}} test-takers assume the role of an apprentice in the ALUSIM company and are introduced to different situations via video clip, and then have to act in the simulated work area with a real computer. For this purpose, various documents are made available, such as customer lists and product catalogs, as well as working tools like writing and <b>tabulation</b> <b>programs,</b> email programs, calendars, calculators, and notepads. The assessment is intended to be authentic in terms of occupational situations, and appropriate with respect to abilities acquired through vocational training. It can be described as a “simulated” performance test that assesses working products and processes (see Kubiszyn and Borich 2010, p. 186) and promotes and captures decision-making. The items are divided into four main curricular areas of focus: work preparation, purchasing, corporate communications, and sales. The response format varies between short-answer items and extended-response items (see Kubiszyn and Borich 2010; Nitko and Brookhart 2014; Hanna and Dettmer 2004). In respect of the latter, for example, emails have to be formulated (e.g., to make formal requests); for short-answer items, brief answers, consisting of numbers or key words, have to be supplied within a given template. These item formats, in contrast to multiple-choice questions, are suitable for assessing competencies that are relevant in vocational situations, because they measure how well test-takers are able to generate answers, act, and express themselves (see Hanna and Dettmer 2004).|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} every well-order {{of the set}} of lattice points induces an {{embedding}} from the set of closed connected orientable 3 -manifolds into the set of links which is a right inverse of the 0 -surgery map and this embedding induces further two embeddings from the set of closed connected orientable 3 -manifolds into the wellordered set of lattice points and into the set of link groups. In particular, the set of closed connected orientable 3 -manifolds is a well-ordered set by a well-order inherited from the well-ordered set of lattice points and the homeomorphism problem on the 3 -manifolds can be in principle replaced by the isomorphism problem on the link groups. To determine the embedding images of every 3 -manifold, we propose a <b>tabulation</b> <b>program</b> on the well-ordered set of 3 -manifolds which {{can be carried out}} inductively until a concrete pair of indistinguishable 3 -manifolds occurs (if there is such a pair).

5000|$|Late 1977 [...] Air Force {{aerospace}} medicine’s pioneering {{contributions to}} cardiovascular disease research continued when a multi-year study was launched to scientifically understand the epidemiology {{of cardiovascular disease}} {{in the context of}} aviation. The study, which focused on older aviators, determined aviation-related conditions that posed the most risk to aviation safety with the fulfilled goal of providing ‘safe to fly’ outcomes that improved aviation utilization and helped extend the careers of veteran aviators. This study was part of a series of aerospace medicine initiatives that greatly contributed to scientific understanding of cardiovascular disease. Among other Air Force studies that contributed to cardiovascular disease research was the Heart Evaluation and Risk <b>Tabulation</b> (HEART) <b>program</b> that involved early diagnosis of heart attacks and strokes in flying personnel. HEART, which provided the basis for new, effective preventive health dietary programs for military and civilian communities, led to the Air Force Coronary Arteriosclerosis Prevention Study {{that was one of the}} first of its kind in the U.S. to study risk factors for cardiovascular disease in pilots in their 40s and 50s.|$|R
40|$|Finding {{the longest}} common {{subsequence}} in $k$-length substrings (LCS$k$) is a recently proposed problem motivated by computational biology. This is a generalization of the well-known LCS problem in which matching symbols from two sequences $A$ and $B$ are replaced with matching non-overlapping substrings of length $k$ from $A$ and $B$. We propose several algorithms for LCS$k$, being non-trivial incarnations {{of the major}} concepts known from LCS research (dynamic programming, sparse dynamic <b>programming,</b> <b>tabulation).</b> Our algorithms make use of a linear-time and linear-space preprocessing finding the occurrences of all the substrings of length $k$ from one sequence in the other sequence.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} applicative caching technique from functional programming is adapted to OLD resolution {{as an alternative to}} OLDT resolution for predicates that are actually functions. An inference system, OLDTF resolution, is given with a proof procedure. It is argued why this special case is interesting in its own right also outside the area of deductive databases. It is outlined how special cases of our technique can be used to declaratively incorporate efficient data structures with state in logic programs. 1 Introduction In a programming language with referential transparency, an expression can be replaced with any other expression that has the same meaning. <b>Tabulation</b> in functional <b>programming</b> In functional programming languages this has been exploited through a technique called tabulation or memoing [6, 15, 18, 23].

40|$|The Logic Push-Down Automaton (LPDA) is {{introduced}} as an abstract operational {{model for the}} evaluation of logic programs. The LPDA can be used to describe a significant number of evaluation strategies, ranging from the top-down OLD strategy to bottom-up strategies, with or without prediction. Two types of dynamic programming, i. e. tabular, interpretation are defined, one being more efficient but restricted to a subclass of LPDAs. We propose to evaluate a logic program by first compiling it into a LPDA according to some chosen evaluation strategy, and then applying a tabular interpreter to this LPDA. This approach offers great flexibility and generalizes Magic Set transformations. It explains in a more intuitive way some known Magic Set variants and their limits, and also suggests new developments. Keywords: logic <b>programs,</b> <b>tabulation,</b> memoing, magic-set, dynamic programming, push-down automata. 1 Introduction The recent years have seen the popularity of (at least) two approaches to i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{solving a}} query, the SLD proof {{procedure}} for definite programs sometimes searches an infinite {{space for a}} non existing solution. For example, querying a planner for an unreachable goal state. Such programs motivate the development of methods to prove {{the absence of a}} solution. Considering the definite program and the query / Q as clauses of a first order theory, one can apply model generators which search for a finite interpretation in which the program clauses as well as the clause false / Q are true. This paper develops a new approach which exploits the fact that all clauses are definite. It is based on a goal directed abductive search in the space of finite pre-interpretations for a pre-interpretation such that Q is false in the least model of the program based on it. Several methods for efficiently searching the space of pre-interpretations are presented. Experimental results confirm that our approach find solutions with less search than {{with the use of a}} first order model generator.

40|$|The {{national}} and state reports of the 19802 ̆ 7 s led to a general premise that changes {{should be made to}} improve secondary education. In response to these reports revised state standards were implemented. ^ The purpose for conducting {{this study was to determine}} whether the education reform movement and the revised state standards had brought about changes in the grade 9 - 12 program offerings and program enrollments in Nebraska Class II and Class III school districts. A secondary purpose was to develop a data base describing the current grade 9 - 12 course offerings and course enrollments. ^ A stratified sample of 48 Nebraska high schools was chosen. Pertinent data about courses offered and courses taken during the 1982 - 1983 and 1987 - 1988 school years were organized according to thirteen designated subject areas. The fall curriculum reports from the Nebraska Department of Education provided the data. ^ The amount of class time for each subject area was used as the underlying quantifier. Courses offered were measured in terms of instructional units. Courses taken by students were measured in terms of enrollment units. ^ A repeated measures t statistic was used to test for changes. The t statistic was used to develop a summary <b>tabulation</b> of <b>program</b> data for small-enrollment, medium-enrollment, and large-enrollment schools. ^ The results of this study indicated that certain changes had occurred. There had been an increase in the program offerings and an increase in the program enrollments. Some shifts of emphasis in program offerings and program participation among the subject areas had occurred. ^ In developing the data base it was found that the most courses were offered in the large-enrollment schools and the most enrollment units per student were taken in the small-enrollment schools. There were only slight differences in the percentages of total program offered in the academic areas among the three categories. In percentages of total program taken in the academic areas, the large-enrollment schools ranked first and the small-enrollment schools ranked third. ...|$|R
