Former policies based on structural measures to reduce the alea were found excessively expensive, but liberal approaches based <b>on</b> <b>insurance</b> mechanisms were not suited to face extreme events. Better solutions depend on the re-appraisal of water as a common property and the design of corresponding institutions. In France, these could have been the agences de l'eau, which are now in charge of implementing the Water Framework Directive. But back in 1966, central government refused to involve them in flood control, keeping the latter in its own realm. After 1983, successive Governments preferred to develop cat'nat’, a solidarity scheme based <b>on</b> <b>taxes</b> added <b>on</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> and <b>on</b> local risk protection plans (PPR-i) constraining land use rights. This system's benefits and shortcomings are discussed, including the discrepancies between national post-disaster solidarity and local pre-disaster vulnerability reduction; it lastly shows recent evolutions towards catchment-based approaches in complex multi-level governance, in which the hydrographic district level, adopted to synthesise the flood risk management plans (FRMPs), is supplemented by catchment programmes on flood risks called PAPI.

40|$|What are the {{economic}} rationales for the pub-lic subsidy of private health insurance? Induc-ing {{more people to}} purchase private cover {{has the potential to}} create a positive fiscal exter-nality, as it frees up the limited public beds and other public resources for people who cannot afford private health insurance. Investigating this quantitatively, based on short-run demand estimates, we find that the subsidy cannot be justified {{on the basis of this}} externality effect alone. We estimate that the optimal subsidy is actually negative, that is, a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> private health <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the externality does finance some of the costs. We then consider a long-run dynamic version, consistent with the government’s stated ration-ales for the reforms.

40|$|Vehicle mass is {{a crucial}} factor for the {{distribution}} of injuries between occupants in involved vehicles in a two-vehicle crash. A larger vehicle mass protects the occupants in the vehicle while on the same time inflicts a higher injury risk on the occupants in the collision partner. This mass externality can be internalized to reach {{a situation where the}} drivers choose vehicle mass based on the social optimum instead of a private optimum that ignores the negative effects that a large vehicle mass has on the injury risk in presumptive collision partners. Using a database including collision accidents in Sweden involving two passenger cars during five years, the influence of vehicle mass on the injuries and thereby the accident cost in both vehicles is explored. The database contains information on road infrastructure, vehicle characteristics including vehicle mass and characteristics of the occupants in the vehicles including their injuries. To get a measure of the accident cost the Swedish official economic valuation of slight injuries, severe injuries and fatalities are applied. In each accident the two involved vehicles are divided into the lighter vehicle and the heavier vehicle and the effect of weight is examined separately for the two groups. The accident cost that falls on the lighter vehicle increases with the mass of the heavier vehicle and decreases with own mass. Given that a vehicle is the heavier one in the crash, neither the own mass nor the mass of the lighter vehicle significantly affect the accident cost. The expected external accident cost is calculated and it is shown to increase rapidly with vehicle mass. The paper discusses different solutions to internalize this external accident cost and calculates a mass dependent multiplicative <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> in a no-fault insurance system.

40|$|Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) {{automobile}} insurance enables insurers {{to charge the}} vehicle owner per mile instead of a pre-set number of miles per year. PAYD is offered to motorists on an optional basis, i. e., they can also choose a conventional scheme. PAYD <b>insurance</b> builds <b>on</b> the improved possibilities brought by new in-vehicle technologies for measuring distance driven. However, there is a range of other risk factors that could be supervised, {{some of which are}} already used by the insurance industry. For instance, one Swedish insurance provider charges a lower premium to vehicles that have an alco-lock installed to make it impossible to use the vehicle for an intoxicated driver. In this report, we summarize some work we have done on how to incorporate two of the most important risk factors; vehicle mass and speed. The possibility to differentiate <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> according to various risk factors raises questions on the interaction between vehicle insurance schemes and taxes. Distance driven, speeding and vehicle mass are in many countries subject to taxation (for instance gasoline tax for distance, speeding tickets for speed and vehicle tax for vehicle mass). We will briefly discuss how a PAYD scheme with a speeding penalty (this will here be called Pay As You Speed, PAYS) can be combined with taxes to implement a Pigou taxation of road accident externalities. We summarize results from a vehicle-fleet experiment with a PAYS insurance incentive for keeping within speed limits using a speed-alert device. The PAYS scheme was simulated with a monthly bonus to participants during two months reduced by a non-linear speeding penalty. We analyse this 9 ̆ 3 mass externality 9 ̆ 4 using a database including collision accidents in Sweden involving two passenger cars during five years.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether myopia (misperception of {{the long-term}} care (LTC) risk) and private insurance market loading costs can justify social LTC insurance and/or the subsidization of private insurance. We use a two-period model wherein individuals di¤er in three unobservable characteristics: level of productivity, survival probability and degree of ignorance concerning the risk of LTC (the former two being perfectly positively correlated). The decentralization of a �rst-best allocation requires that LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> of the myopic agents are subsidized (at a �Pigouvian�rate) and/or that there is public provision of the appropriate level of LTC. The support for the considered LTC policy instruments is less strong in a second-best setting. When social LTC provision is restricted to zero, a myopic agent�s <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> private LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> involves a tradeo¤ between paternalistic and redistributive (incentive) considerations and {{we may have a}} tax as well as a subsidy <b>on</b> private LTC <b>insurance.</b> Interestingly, savings (which goes untaxed in the �rst-best but plays the role of self-insurance in the second-best) is also subject to (positive or negative) taxation. Social LTC provision is never second-best optimal when private insurance markets are fair (irrespective of the degree of the proportion of myopic individuals and their degree of misperception). At the other extreme, when the loading factor in the private sector is su¢ ciently high, private coverage is completely crowded out by public provision. For intermediate levels of the loading factors, the solution relies on both types of insurance...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of an introductory chapter and four independent research papers, summarized as follows. The introductory chapter discusses the role of economics in international health and the policy contributions {{of each of the}} particular papers. In addition, the data and the methods that have been used are discussed. Paper I, entitled Community-based health insurance in low-income countries: a systematic review of the evidence, assesses the evidence base for the extent to which community-based health insurance schemes in low-income countries mobilize resources and provide effective protection. Findings suggest that the evidence base is weak and that these schemes raise little resource and provide only moderate protection. Paper II, Catastrophic Health Payments and Health Insurance in Zambia: The Problem to the Answer, assesses the extent to which health care prepayment in Zambia provide protection against the catastrophic effects of health payments compared with paying for care out-of-pocket. The results indicate that prepayment does not provide such protection and that prepayment may even induce catastrophic effects due to its effect on the demand for care. The third paper, Multiple Health Insurance Availability, Health Care Utilization, and Expenditures: Evidence from Jordan, looks at various health insurance programs in Jordan. The analysis suggests that the effect of <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> utilization and expenditures differ significantly across the various insurance types. Also, the effect of the programs differs across income groups.
