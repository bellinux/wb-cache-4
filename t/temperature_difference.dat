5|$|However, {{the extent}} of its {{contribution}} to the actual temperature differential between North America and Europe {{is a matter of}} dispute, as there is a recent minority opinion within the science community that this <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> (beyond that caused by contrasting maritime and continental climates) is mainly due to atmospheric waves created by the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between the two causes violent water-lava interactions {{that make up the}} eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift {{is the high}} summer <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This is {{accompanied}} by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of the ITS- 90 gives rise to relatively small <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> depending on the specific interpolation equation (temperature range) used. Also the use of different thermometers gives rise to small <b>temperature</b> <b>differences.</b> These and the already published <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> between the ITS- 90 and thermodynamic temperature lead to an additional small uncertainty in {{the difference between the}} triple point temperatures of pure 22 Ne and 20 Ne.

25|$|Heat storage enables {{solar thermal}} plants to produce {{electricity}} during hours without sunlight. Heat {{is transferred to}} a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. Thermal storage mediums {{will be discussed in}} a heat storage section.

One idea, which would supply the equivalent power of several nuclear power plants, would deploy a field of underwater turbines placed 300 meters (980ft) under the center of the core of the Gulf Stream. Ocean thermal energy could also be harnessed to produce electricity using the <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between cold deep water and warm surface water.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts. Significant shear is {{observed}} when the <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> {{across the front}} is 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts {{is more of an}} aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|E
5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for {{transporting}} this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

5|$|At the {{confluence}} of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers, young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in the headwaters of the Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant <b>temperature</b> <b>difference.</b> (Prior to the removal of Lewiston Dam on the main Clearwater and Grangeville Dam on the South Fork Clearwater, the Clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon.) Agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on the Snake warm its waters as it flows through the Snake River Plain, so as the Snake meets the Clearwater, its average temperature is much higher. Directly below {{the confluence}}, the river flows into Lower Granite Lake, formed by Lower Granite Dam, the uppermost dam of the Lower Snake River Project. Paradoxically, the combination of these factors gives the young salmon further time to grow and to feed in Lower Granite Lake, so when they begin the migration to the Pacific Ocean, they often have a higher chance at survival, compared to those salmon who migrate to the ocean earlier.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E

Results show that the mean <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> between the CTD and each XBT system over the total XBT profile were greater than the +/- O. 15 degrees Celsius specification for XBT probes. In the isothermal portion of the mixed layer where the <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> are minimized due to depth, instrument response, and internal waves, the <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> between the XBT's and CTD were reduced by an order of magnitude.

5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a <b>temperature</b> <b>difference</b> of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

30|$|The {{explanations}} of compound processes or principles {{can be more}} complex in their representations {{as shown in the}} ‘Weather’ example below. Sentences may refer to two contrasting objects/agents (e.g. high and low latitudes) with differing and contrasting properties (e.g. <b>temperature</b> <b>differences,</b> daylight hour differences) which are interconnected. In such cases it is useful to identify objects/agents and their key contrasting properties which are most important or most related to them. In the weather example, daylight hours and <b>temperature</b> <b>differences</b> are noted with the property contrasts at high and low latitudes. A connective consequence arc can show the overarching consequence relation between daylight hours and <b>temperature</b> <b>differences.</b> However, these differences depend on the time of the year, both being greater in winter, with the causal consequence being the daylight hour differences winter to summer.|$|R
