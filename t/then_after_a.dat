5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, {{first as a}} demo in August 2012, <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> successful Kickstarter campaign, as a full game via Steam in July 2014. A version for the Wii U console was released in October 2015. Freedom Planet has been widely compared to the Sega Genesis Sonic games. Critics praised its gameplay, aesthetics, and balance of Sonic elements with original content, but were mixed on its pacing and length. A sequel, titled Freedom Planet 2, is scheduled for a release sometime in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Marion Archibald and Valerie Fenwick {{proposed}} an alternative hypothesis, {{based on the}} evidence of East Anglian coins and post-Conquest documents. Acknowledging that Beonna and Beornred were the same person, they suggested that after Ælfwald's death in 749, Æthelwald of Mercia installed Beornred/Beonna to rule northern East Anglia and Alberht (who probably belonged to the Wuffingas dynasty) to rule in the south. According to Archibald and Fenwick, after Æthelbald was murdered in 757, Beornred/Beonna became king of Mercia, during which his coinage was increased in East Anglia, perhaps to meet “military requirements”. <b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> reign of only a few months, he was deposed by Offa and forced to flee from him back into East Anglia. Alberht, who had attempted to re-establish East Anglia as an independent kingdom and rule alone, and had succeeded for a short time, was deposed by Beornred/Beonna when he arrived as an exile in about 760. Soon afterwards, Offa asserted his authority over the East Angles in around 760-5 and removed Beonna.|$|E
5|$|Within South Africa, {{there was}} growing {{realisation}} among opponents of apartheid that sport {{could play a}} role in pressuring the government. During the 1950s, South Africa competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within South Africa united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white Football Association of South Africa from FIFA—for two years from 1961, <b>then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented South Africa from participating in the 1966 World Cup. South Africa was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white South Africa, the impact was limited. Suspension from the Olympics had a greater effect; another campaign from within South Africa and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in South Africa being barred from the 1964 Olympics and those that followed.|$|E

25|$|The Panthers {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} game in the second half. Smith returned a Gowin punt seven yards to the Panthers 37-yard line. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> 24-yard reception by Muhammad, he caught a 7-yard pass and capped the drive with a 32-yard touchdown catch. Later on, he returned a punt to his own 40-yard line, setting up a 38-yard drive that ended with Kasay's fourth field goal, increasing the Panthers lead to 26–3.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings scored 14 {{unanswered}} {{points in}} the first half, starting with wide receiver Sammy White's 30-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Tommy Kramer. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> punt, they drove 69 yards in 10 plays to score on running back Ted Brown's 1-yard touchdown run. However, Philadelphia scored before halftime by finishing off an 85-yard drive with quarterback Ron Jaworski's 9-yard touchdown completion to wide receiver Harold Carmichael. The Eagles then tied the game on the opening possession of the second half with Wilbert Montgomery's 8-yard touchdown run.|$|E
25|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> Hamilton rouge, Winnipeg's RB/KR Fritz Hanson {{caught a}} punt, {{and after a}} few moves and a few missed tackles, {{was on his way to}} a 78-yard {{touchdown}} return, making the score 18–10. Hamilton would force a safety to bring themselves within six points, but failed to crack the endzone, getting as far as the Winnipeg four-yard line. The final score was Winnipeg 18, Hamilton 12. With that, Winnipeg had become the first team from Western Canada to win a Grey Cup.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Oliver fumbled a punt return that Johnston {{recovered}} {{to set up a}} Boniol field goal, cutting the deficit to 17–14. But this was as close as they would get, as the Panthers kicked three more field goals over the Cowboys one. On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> punt, he carried the ball six times for 22 yards to set up another score on Kasay's 40-yard kick a few plays into the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{next time}} New York got the ball, Collins' 43-yard {{completion}} to Ron Dixon {{set up an}} 8-yard touchdown pass to receiver Joe Jurevicius, making the score 24–0. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> punt, New York drove 62 yards and scored another Daluiso field goal, aided by a 21-yard run from Tiki Barber, and a 21-yard pass interference penalty against defensive back Wasswa Serwanga. On the last drive of the half, Hilliard caught four passes for 59 yards on a 77-yard drive that ended with his 7-yard touchdown reception with 12 seconds left.|$|E
25|$|In May 1877, a {{group of}} buffalo hunters led by James Harvey, a Civil War veteran and long-time buffalo hunter, {{was looking for a}} buffalo herd. <b>Then</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> series of Comanche raids led by Red Young Man, where much stock was taken and a few hunters killed, the game changed. The hunters started after a more deadly game on the Llano Estacado region of north-west Texas and eastern New Mexico looking for revenge against the Comanche. The men were a mix of former Union and Confederate soldiers, former trappers and mixed breeds and knew how to fight.|$|E

25|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> 6 years break, {{which only}} saw the {{publication}} of L'accélérateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim {{not included in the}} official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and José-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and not just from Franquin's period.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, the {{government}} began to increase {{the value of the}} baht by following all increases in the value of silver against gold but not reducing it when the silver price fell. Beginning at 21.75 baht = one pound sterling, the currency rose in value until, in 1908, a fixed peg to the British pound sterling was established of 13 baht = one pound. This was revised to 12 baht in 1919 and <b>then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> period of instability, to 11 baht in 1923. During World War II, the baht was fixed at a value of one Japanese yen.|$|E
25|$|On February 5, {{based on}} {{intelligence}} of the enemy's continued buildup and the positioning of his major troop units, General Abrams decided that the enemy offensive had in fact begun. MACV {{brought to bear on}} the enemy buildup everything it had—within the still restrictive rules of engagement. Tactical air sorties, gunships, and B-52 strikes were brought in practically nonstop. A 48-hour maximum effort was begun, concentrating all available airpower against the B-3 Front in the Vietnam's Central Highlands. <b>Then,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> 24-hour cease-fire for the Tet holiday, the same maximum effort was applied in Military Region 1 in the north.|$|E
