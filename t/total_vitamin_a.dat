The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the adequacy of vitamin A intakes in pregnant and lactating women from low-income, urban and rural communities. Subjects/Methods: One or two previous-day dietary recalls were collected in a convenience sample of 234 pregnant and lactating women in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Estimated daily intakes and main sources of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> provitamin A and preformed vitamin A were calculated. Total intakes, adjusted for day-to-day variation, were examined in relation to estimated average requirements (EAR). Results: Median estimated 1 -day <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake was 1177 [*]μg retinol activity equivalents (RAE) (interquartile range (IQR) 832 – 1782) in the urban site and 567 [*]μg RAE (IQR 441 – 737) in the rural site. Women not meeting their status-specific vitamin A requirement were 3. 5 times more common in the rural communities (31 %) than in the urban confines (9 %). In the urban area, 26 women (21 %) had preformed vitamin A intakes above 1500 [*]μg on the day of data collection. Preformed vitamin A accounted for a median of 83. 9 % and 60. 9 % of the daily <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake in the urban and rural sites, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} plasma {{and urine}} concentrations of retinol, retinyl esters, retinol-binding protein (RBP), and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in dogs with chronic renal disease (CRD). ANIMALS 17 dogs with naturally developing CRD and 21 healthy control dogs. PROCEDURE A diagnosis of CRD was established {{on the basis}} of clinical signs, plasma concentrations of creatinine and urea, and results of urinalysis. Concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters were measured by use of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of RBP and THP were measured by use of sensitive ELISA systems. RESULTS Dogs with CRD had higher plasma concentrations of retinol, which were not paralleled by differences in plasma concentrations of RBP. Calculated ratio of urinary <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> (sum of concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters to creatinine concentration) and ratio of the concentration of urinary retinyl esters to creatinine concentration did not differ between groups. However, we detected a significantly higher retinol-to-creatinine ratio in the urine of dogs with CRD, which was paralleled by a higher urinary RBP-to-creatinine ratio. Thus, in dogs with CRD, the estimated fractional clearance of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> retinol, and RBP was increased. Furthermore, dogs with CRD had a reduced urinary THP-to-creatinine ratio.

We attempted to elucidate the association by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases, {{as well as by}} reviewing the references of retrieved publications. Summary odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI) were computed with a random-effects model. Study-specific ORs and 95 % CIs for the highest vs. lowest categories of vitamin A intake were pooled. RESULTS: A total of 8 case-control studies and 2 prospective studies comprising 3, 328 melanoma cases and 233, 295 non-case subjects were included. The summary OR for the highest compared with the lowest intake of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> retinol and beta-carotene was 0. 86 (95 % CI =  0. 59 - 1. 25), 0. 80 (95 % CI =  0. 69 - 0. 92) and 0. 87 (95 %CI =  0. 62 - 1. 20), respectively. Significant heterogeneity was observed among studies on vitamin A and beta-carotene intake, but not among studies on retinol intake. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. There was no indication of publication bias.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic {{insufficient}} {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) patients receive vitamin A supplementation according to CF-specific recommendations to prevent deficiencies. Whether current recommendations are optimal for preventing both deficiency and toxicity {{is a subject}} of debate. We assessed the longitudinal relation between serum retinol levels and appropriate variables. METHODS: We studied vitamin A intake, and {{the long-term effects of}} vitamin A intake, coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on serum retinol levels in 221 paediatrics CF patients during a seven-year follow up period. RESULTS: <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake, derived from 862 dietary assessments, exceeded the tolerable upper intake level in 30 % of the assessments, mainly up to age six. Although CF patients failed to meet the CF-specific recommendations, serum retinol deficiency was found in only 17 / 862 (2 %) of the measurements. Longitudinally, we observed no association to serum retinol levels for <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake, CFA, gender or age but serum retinol levels were associated with serum IgG levels. Each g/L increase in serum IgG level would result in a 2. 49 % (95 % CI - 3. 60 to - 1. 36 %) reduction in serum retinol levels. CONCLUSION: In this large sample of children and adolescents with CF, serum retinol deficiency was rare despite lower than the CF-specific recommendations. However, the TUL was commonly exceeded. A reduction in CF-specific vitamin A supplementation recommendations should therefore be considered. Moreover, serum retinol levels were not associated with vitamin A intake, CFA, gender or age, although a decreased serum retinol was associated with an increased serum IgG...|$|E

The suitability of the food-frequency questionnaire, which {{was developed by the}} Medical Research Council - Cardiff Group, for determining dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins in epidemiological studies was investigated in 196 Scottish men. The validity of the dietary data was assessed by comparison with serum vitamin concentrations, and separate analyses were performed for current smokers and non-smokers. The results showed that total energy intake and the percentage of energy derived from sugar were higher in smokers, and that both dietary and serum values of vitamin C, β-carotene and vitamin E were lower in smokers than non-smokers. After adjustment for serum lipids, energy intake and body mass index, correlation coefficients between dietary and serum vitamins C and E were similar for smokers (r 0. 555 and 0. 25 respectively) and non-smokers (r 0. 58 and 0. 32 respectively).

To estimate the prevalence of supplementation and the vitamin supplement contribution to total intake among Warsaw population aged 20 - 74 years. Material and methods. Nutrient intake and supplement use were studied in a representative sample of Warsaw population in years 2011 / 12 (486 men and 421 women) and in 2001 (658 and 671 respectively).

40|$|AbstractVitamin C {{degradation}} in acerola pulp during {{thermal treatment}} by ohmic and conventional heating was evaluated. The ohmic heating technology was studied using a Central Composite Rotatable Design, and two variables were evaluated: the solids {{content of the}} pulp (2 – 8  g/ 100  g) and the heating voltage (120 – 200  V). The results indicate that ascorbic acid degradation was significantly influenced by both of the aforementioned variables. The <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C degradation {{was influenced by the}} linear and the quadratic effects of the voltage. A comparative evaluation of the conventional and the ohmic heating processes showed that ohmic heating, when performed with low voltage gradients, promoted degradation of both the ascorbic acid and the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C in <b>a</b> manner similar to conventional heating. However, high voltage gradients induced greater ascorbic acid degradation because of electrochemical reactions. These reactions increased when high electric fields were applied, producing compounds that catalyzed the degradation pathways of ascorbic acid in the presence of oxygen...|$|R
30|$|Faced {{with the}} {{challenge}} to valorize this natural wonder, {{it is necessary that}} total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity (in soluble of lipid and water), total protein, <b>total</b> carbohydrate, and <b>vitamin</b> (<b>A,</b> C, and E) contents were determined in Gracilaria bursa-pastoris, in order to identify the new resources of natural antioxidant molecules. The present study evaluated the antioxidant potential of methanolic and aqueous extracts from Gracilaria bursa-pastoris from Nador lagoon in Mediterranean Moroccan costs by measuring the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and total content of phenolic, flavonoids, and flavonols content in each extract.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} households' {{strategies}} on preschool children's intakes of vitamin A {{were examined in}} a rural Guatemalan village. The children's caretakers were interviewed regarding acquisition, preparation, storage and consumption of vitamin A sources on four separate occasions while children's intakes were measured by a seven-day food frequency questionnaire. The median daily intake of vitamin A was 128 μg and on average β-carotene constituted 45. 5 % of daily intake. Socioeconomic variables did not predict vitamin A intakes; only horse ownership was associated (r =. 30, p <. 05) with beta-carotene, but not <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake. Purchased and cultivated sources were significant predictors of intakes. Of all the variables, household consumption of vitamin A was the prevailing predictor. However, household consumption was associated in a threshold fashion with children's intakes; it {{was a significant predictor}} of intakes only when household consumption was ≥ 11 food items measured over four days...|$|E
40|$|Storing {{processed}} food products can cause alterations in their chemical compositions. Thus, {{the objective of}} this study was to evaluate carotenoid retention in the kernels of minimally processed normal and vitamin A precursor (proVA) -biofortified green corn ears that were packaged in polystyrene trays covered with commercial film or in multilayered polynylon packaging material and were stored. Throughout the storage period, the carotenoids were extracted from the corn kernels using organic solvents and were quantified using HPLC. A completely factorial design including three factors (cultivar, packaging and storage period) was applied for analysis. The green kernels of maize cultivars BRS 1030 and BRS 4104 exhibited similar carotenoid profiles, with zeaxanthin being the main carotenoid. Higher concentrations of the carotenoids lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, and β-carotene, the total carotenoids and the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> precursor carotenoids were detected in the green kernels of the biofortified BRS 4104 maize. The packaging method did not affect carotenoid retention in the kernels of minimally processed green corn ears during the storage period...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. In a work-site {{nutrition}} intervention targeting fat and fiber, {{we examined}} the intervention's effect on specific nutrients implicated in carcinogenesis, including trace metals, vitamins, and categories of fatty acids. The rationale {{was based on the}} association observed in a variety of epidemiologic studies between these nutrients and epithelial cancers. METHODS. Data were taken from eight control companies and five intervention companies that fully implemented the Treatwell intervention. Analyses of variance were used preserving the study's nested design. RESULTS. Significant intervention-related associations were observed for increased <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> and carotene. Marginal intervention effects were observed for relative decreases in the percentage of calories from both saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, a relatively smaller increase in the percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an increase in the consumption of vitamin B 6. CONCLUSIONS. Results indicate a broader effect of the intervention than on fat and fiber only. Increased intake of carotene, the single most important of these other nutrients, is plausibly related to a variety of epithelial cancers...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{importance}} in many physiological {{processes such as}} cell proliferation and differentiation, <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> {{plays a key role}} in reproduction. The present study examines the content and distribution of retinol and retinyl esters in the blood plasma, liver, kidney, ovary and oviduct (infundibulum, magnum, isthmus and uterus) of the laying Japanese quail. (1) The results show that the stage of egg laying had no influence on the level of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> (retinol or retinyl esters) in plasma, kidney and liver. (2) The results further indicate that in the oviduct there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the concentration of retinol and retinyl esters, but that these differences are not altered by the stage of egg formation. (3) The highest levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> in the isthmus and uterus were associated with a predominance of retinyl esters (palmitate and stearate); sections with lower <b>total</b> levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> (infundibulum, magnum) had retinol as the more dominant form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A.</b> (4) Changes in the ratio of retinol to retinyl esters in the various sections of the avian oviduct might point to metabolic differences. The storage of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> might therefore be the predominant function of the uterus and isthmus; in the infundibulum and magnum, where <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> is predominantly present as retinol, <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> serves rather as a precursor for the modulation of the cellular metabolism of these structures...|$|R
40|$|Background Preterm infants {{have reduced}} liver stores of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> at birth {{compared}} to term born infants. Current guidelines recommend an intake of 700 - 1500 IU/kg/day <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> {{and there is}} evidence to support higher doses for infants with significant lung disease. The importance of appropriate early nutrition for preterm infants is increasingly becoming apparent. Objectives To examine whether preterm infants admitted to a UK neonatal unit received the currently recommended amounts of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> during the first 4 weeks of life, and to identify the feeding patterns associated with optimal <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake. Design Retrospective case note review. Setting UK tertiary neonatal unit. Population 36 preterm infants with a median gestation of 30 weeks (range 26 - 33 weeks) and median birth weight of 1305 g (range 880 - 1800 g). Main outcome measure Mean daily <b>total</b> intake of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> in each of the first 4 weeks of life. Results Despite a policy of introducing intravenous lipid supplemented with fat soluble vitamins on day 2, only four infants (11 %) consistently met the recommended daily intake of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> during the first 2 weeks of life. Adequacy of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake in the first 2 weeks of life was not predicted by gestation or pattern of feeding. Conclusion Recommendations for intravenous <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> supplementation in parenterally fed preterm infants require revision. Intravenous lipid with added fat soluble vitamins should be started as soon as possible after birth, and consideration given to early oral <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> supplementation in those infants tolerant of enteral feed...|$|R
40|$|Lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTS) in men {{may be related}} to micronutrients involved in prevention of oxidative damage or cell growth and differentiation. We tested the hypothesis that carotenoid, <b>vitamin</b> <b>A,</b> and <b>vitamin</b> C intake were inversely associated with total LUTS, voiding, and storage symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional multivariate analysis of 1466 men aged 30 – 79 y in the Boston Area Community Health survey (2002 – 2005), a population-based random sample survey. Data were collected by in-person interview and validated FFQ. Moderate-to-severe LUTS were defined using the American Urological Symptom Index and analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Overall, men consuming greater dietary lycopene, β-carotene, <b>total</b> carotenoid, or <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> had ∼ 40 – 50 % decreased odds of LUTS compared with the lowest intake quartiles (e. g. β-carotene and storage symptoms, OR = 0. 56, 95 % CI = 0. 39, 0. 82; P-trend = 0. 02). Interactions were observed between dietary iron and vitamin C or β-cryptoxanthin, whereby inverse associations with LUTS, particularly voiding symptoms, occurred only among men with moderate-to-high iron intake (P-interaction = 0. 001). High-dose supplemental and <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C were positively associated with LUTS (e. g. supplemental vitamin C ≥ 250 mg/d, OR = 1. 83, 95 % CI = 1. 21, 2. 77; P-trend = 0. 02). An interaction between β-carotene and smoking status (P-interaction = 0. 004) indicated greater odds of LUTS with higher β-carotene intake among current smokers. Results suggest that modifying consumption of carotenoids and vitamin C may influence LUTS in men...|$|R
