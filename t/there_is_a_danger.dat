5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled electric ray can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes {{to be used in}} medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In {{an interview with the}} author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

25|$|In January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol {{announced}} a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal {{would require the}} stripping of lead paint from {{the interior of the}} dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the interstitial space between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the interstitial space and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, are showing significant signs of rust and disrepair. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> that decorative ironwork could fall from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda. Without immediate repair, safety netting will be installed (blocking the rotunda's artwork from view).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided {{by the use of}} sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Oppenheimer {{reviewed}} the Weale and Capelli studies {{and suggested that}} correlations of gene frequency mean nothing without {{a knowledge of the}} genetic prehistory of the regions in question. His criticism of these studies is that they generated models based on the historical evidence of Gildas and Procopius, and then selected methodologies to test against these populations. Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the genetic map than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the Belgae and other continental people – and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons – arrived earlier and were already strong in the 5th century in particular regions or areas. Oppenheimer, basing his research on the Weale and Capelli studies, maintains that none of the invasions since the Romans have {{had a significant impact on}} the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping. He says that most people in the British Isles are genetically similar to the Basque people of northern Spain and southwestern France, from 90% in Wales to 66% in East Anglia. Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow – one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe – which occurred just after the Last Glacial Maximum. Bryan Sykes, a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History, published in the United States and Canada as Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland. Many feasible scenarios can be constructed to account for evidence. However, Y-chromosome evidence relies on the archaeological and historical evidence for interpretation, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of creating a circular argument. Therefore, scenarios that are not justified by other evidence or are created to account for the historical evidence have not been universally accepted.|$|E
500|$|The final {{portion of}} the book {{analyzes}} consequentialism {{within the scope of}} normative ethics and deontological ethics. Florida State University Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar Fernando Tesón writes in his essay [...] "Targeted Killing in War and Peace: A Philosophical Analysis" [...] that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. University of Illinois law and philosophy professor Michael Moore says in [...] "Targeted Killings and the Morality of Hard Choices" [...] that targeted killing can be seen as justified through both deontological and consequentialist models. University of Pennsylvania School of Law professor Leo Katz writes in [...] "Targeted Killing and the Strategic Use of Self-Defense" [...] that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of a state government artificially generating instances in which it asserts it must use targeted killing in self-defense. He warns against situations in which governments find it easier to kill terrorists than to put them through due process of law. Katz concludes that current regulations support targeted killing because existing law does not consider his argument and justifies the tactical elimination of terrorists.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{its high}} {{concentration}} of morphine, opium tincture is useful for treating moderate to severe pain. (The amount of codeine in the tincture is negligible and {{does not have any}} appreciable analgesic effect.) The dose of tincture is generally {{the same as that of}} morphine in opioid-naïve patients, titrated upward as needed. The usual starting dose in adults is 1.5mL by mouth every 3 to 4 hours, representing the equivalent of 15mg (approximately 1/4 grain) of morphine per dose. Opioid-tolerant patients may require higher than normal dosing. For the opioid tolerant patient, doses in the range of 3-6 mL every 3-4 hours would be usual. [...] This would represent an equivalent daily dose of between 180mg and 480mg of morphine. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of overdose in treating pain with opium tincture; see below.|$|E
