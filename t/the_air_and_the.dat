5|$|A {{different}} ad for General Motors {{featured a}} laid off assembly line robot contemplating suicide, which drew {{criticism from the}} American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company's website. The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25.|$|E
5|$|Because they {{deferred}} their {{selection to}} the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half.

After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E

Light's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E
40|$|A rotor and stator {{assembly}} having a rotor and a stator with opposing surfaces defining an <b>air</b> bearing <b>and</b> an <b>air</b> dam of an aspirating face seal. In a first embodiment, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> dam are axially offset. In a second embodiment, the rotor has an axially extending protuberance located radially between <b>the</b> <b>air</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> dam. <b>The</b> axial offset <b>and</b> <b>the</b> protuberance each act to divert <b>the</b> <b>air</b> flow (e. g., compressed gas or combustion gases in a gas turbine or steam in a steam turbine) {{in a direction}} transverse to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> flow direction through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> dam, thus isolating <b>the</b> <b>air</b> flows from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> dam which improves seal performance...|$|R

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

40|$|Key words: air nozzle; {{filtering}} bag; numerical simulation; pulse cleaning Abstract: With the computational {{fluid dynamics}} (usually being called “{{computational fluid dynamics}} ” for CFD) method, the velocity field between <b>the</b> <b>air</b> nozzle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> filtering bag <b>and</b> <b>the</b> velocity distribution inside the filtering bag are computed when changing the distance between <b>the</b> <b>air</b> nozzle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> filtering bag. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> pressure distribution inside the filtering bag is also computed at different injecting times. According to the simulation result, this article has analyzed the influence of different distances between <b>the</b> <b>air</b> nozzle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> filtering bag <b>and</b> different injecting times on <b>the</b> dust-cleaning effect, <b>and</b> supplied theoretical basis to design the optimal pulse bag filter...|$|R
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that {{take into account the}} following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E
5|$|High relates {{that the}} great serpent Jörmungandr, also {{described}} as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E

5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that {{there was still a}} fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
