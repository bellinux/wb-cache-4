500|$|A {{single parent}} (also termed lone parent or sole parent) is {{a parent who}} cares for one or more {{children}} without {{the assistance of the}} other biological parent. Historically, single-parent families often resulted from death of a spouse, for instance in childbirth. [...] Single-parent homes are increasing as married couples divorce, or as unmarried couples have children. Although widely believed to be detrimental to the mental and physical well being of a child, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> is tolerated.|$|E

[...] In 2009, it remained {{similar to that in}} some other post-industrial nations with 67.4% of all occupied housing units being occupied by the unit's owner. Home ownership rates vary depending on demographic characteristics of households such as ethnicity, race, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> as well as location and type of settlement. In 2014, homeownership dropped to a lower rate than it was in 1994, with a rate of 64%.|$|E
60|$|Then marriage, {{to resume}} my main discussion, does not {{necessarily}} mean cohabitation. All women who desire children {{do not want to be}} entrusted with their upbringing. Some women are sexual and philoprogenitive without being sedulously maternal, and some are maternal without much or any sexual passion. There are men and women in the world now, great allies, fond and passionate lovers who do not live nor want to live constantly together. It is at least conceivable that there are women who, while desiring offspring, do not want to abandon great careers for the work of maternity, women again who would be happiest managing and rearing children in manless households that they might even share with other women friends, and men to correspond with these who do not wish to live in a household with wife and children. I submit, these temperaments exist and have a right to exist in their own way. But one must recognize that the possibility of these departures from the normal <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> opens up other possibilities. The polygamy that is degrading or absurd under one roof assumes a different appearance when one considers it from the point of view of people whose habits of life do not centre upon an isolated home.|$|E

However, for other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> (especially couple households), joblessness {{is usually a}} transient or short term experience. The HILDA panel survey enables policy makers to gain an improved understanding of joblessness by {{making it possible to}} analyse how many households are persistently or multiyear jobless. Previous research was almost entirely based on cross-sectional snapshots <b>of</b> how many <b>household</b> were jobless at one point in time. Annual joblessness rates do not change much, so it seems an ‘obvious’ conclusion that many households remained persistently jobless. This report compares cross-sectional and longitudinal joblessness rates and finds that, for some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> - especially lone parent and lone person households - joblessness is indeed persistent.

60|$|I am {{doubtful}} if many {{of these}} houses had any long use as the residences of single families if {{from the very first}} almost their tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet. They were built with basements, in which their servants worked and lived--servants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs. The dining-room (with folding doors) was a little above the ground level, and in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to follow, was consumed and the numerous family read and worked in the evening, and above was the drawing-room (also with folding doors), where the infrequent callers were received. That was the vision at which those industrious builders aimed. Even while these houses were being run up, the threads upon the loom of fate were shaping to abolish altogether the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> that would have fitted them. Means of transit were developing to carry the moderately prosperous middle-class families out of London, education and factory employment were whittling away at the supply of rough, hardworking, obedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these places, new classes of hard-up middle-class people such as my uncle, employees of various types, were coming into existence, for whom no homes were provided. None of these classes have ideas of what they ought to be, or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory that dominates our minds. It was nobody's concern to see them housed under civilised conditions, and the beautiful laws of supply and demand had free play. They had to squeeze in. The landlords came out financially intact from their blundering enterprise. More and more these houses fell into the hands of married artisans, or struggling widows or old servants with savings, who became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by sub-letting furnished or unfurnished apartments.|$|E
