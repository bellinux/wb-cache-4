5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and reeds, and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> somewhat lower.|$|E

5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E

Pythons are nonvenomous ambush predators, and both the Aeta and pythons hunt deer, wild pigs, and monkeys, making them competitors and prey.|$|E
25|$|A {{nociceptor}} {{is a type}} of receptor {{at the end of a}} sensory neuron's axon that {{responds to}} damaging or potentially damaging stimuli by sending possible threat signals to the spinal cord and the brain.

25|$|Guardian is {{designed}} to operate autonomously, without input from the flight crew. An array of sensors detects a missile approaching the aircraft and passes this information to an infrared tracking camera. The system's computer analyses the input signals, to confirm that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> real, and then directs a beam of an eye-safe infrared laser at the incoming object. The laser is intended to introduce a false target into the missile's guidance system, causing it {{to turn away from}} the aircraft. The detect-track-jam process lasts for two to three seconds. The system then automatically notifies the pilot and air traffic control that a threat has been jammed.|$|E
25|$|Sean affirms <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> real, but {{is unable}} to {{convince}} Pollux to reveal where the bomb is located. At suggestion of his partner Tito Biondi (Robert Wisdom) and Special Ops specialist Dr. Hollis Miller (CCH Pounder), Sean secretly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore) to take on Castor's face and appearance. Sean is taken to the same high-security prison where Pollux is being held, and slowly convinces Pollux that he is Castor, gaining information on the bomb's location. Meanwhile, Castor awakens from his coma prematurely and discovers his face missing. He calls his gang, and they force Dr. Walsh to transplant Sean's face onto him.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of active}} sonar by a {{submarine}} to determine bearing is extremely rare {{and will not}} necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates {{it is more important}} to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.|$|E

25|$|The ‘galleries' {{produced}} by embiopterans are tunnels and chambers woven from the silk they produce. These woven constructions {{can be found}} on substrates such as rocks and the bark of trees, or in leaf litter. Some species camouflage their galleries by decorating the outer layers with bits of leaf litter or other materials to match their surroundings (see image). The galleries are essential to their life cycle, maintaining moisture in their environment, plus offering protection from predators and the elements while foraging, breeding and simply existing. The only occasion when an embiopteran will leave the gallery complex is when winged males fly out or wingless males walk out in search of a mate, or when females explore the area immediately surrounding them in search of a new food source. On detection of a potential predator or threat, the embiids retreat into their galleries, and some species have even been observed to 'play dead' until <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> no longer present.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, these {{pelicans}} may nest in colonies on isolated islands, {{which is}} believed to significantly {{reduce the likelihood of}} mammalian predation. Red foxes and coyotes readily predate colonies that they can access, the later being the only known species to hunt adult pelicans (which are too large for most bird predators to subdue). Several gulls have been known to predate pelican eggs and nestlings (including herring, ring-billed and California gull), as well as common ravens. Young pelicans may be hunted by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, and golden eagles. The pelicans react to mammalian threats differently from avian threats. Though fairly approachable while feeding, the pelicans may temporarily abandon their nests if a human or other large mammal closely approaches the colony. If <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> another bird, however, the pelicans do not abandon the nest and may fight off the interloper by jabbing at them with their considerable bills.|$|E
25|$|The James Bond {{films are}} also {{known to have}} plots {{surrounding}} nuclear weapons. Films like Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Octopussy (1983), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and The World Is Not Enough (1999) involve nuclear weapons. Some are based around their threatened use or theft, others in a showdown between the superpowers. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> prevented by Bond {{in the nick of}} time, although weapons are detonated in The Spy Who Loved Me when two Polaris missiles each destroy a stolen nuclear submarine out at sea, British and Russian respectively. However, these do not harm the world's population or land, killing only the villain's crews in each stolen submarine. In Goldfinger (1964) the titular antagonist (with assistance from Chinese and North Korean agents who want economic collapse in the West) attempts to irradiate the US's national gold reserves stored at Fort Knox with an atomic bomb in order to increase the value of his own stockpile. The villain in Octopussy (1983) was a power-mad renegade Soviet general opposed to disarmament talks with NATO, who hatches an elaborate plot to invade Western Europe after the clandestine placement and detonation of a nuclear weapon on a US Air Force base in West Germany. GoldenEye (1995) focuses on a nuclear satellite weapon that unleashes a powerful electromagnetic pulse attack upon whatever area it is detonated over, destroying anything with an electronic circuit.|$|E

500|$|A {{moderate}} risk day {{indicates that}} more widespread and/or more dangerous severe weather is possible (sometimes with major hurricanes), with significant severe weather often more likely. Numerous tornadoes (some {{of which may}} be strong and potentially long-track), more widespread or severe wind damage and/or very large/destructive hail (up to or exceeding [...] in diameter) could occur. Major events, such as large tornado outbreaks or widespread straight-line wind events, are sometimes also possible on moderate risk days, but with greater uncertainty. Moderate risk days are not terribly uncommon, and typically occur several times a month during the peak of the severe weather season, and occasionally at other times of the year. Slight and enhanced risk areas typically surround areas under a moderate risk, where <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>is</b> lower.|$|E
