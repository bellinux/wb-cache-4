5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of those songs which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E

When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha had gotten the wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, with others <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> with themselves.|$|E

Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} {{participation}} of Chinese student {{in an international}} student assessment test, the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first {{in all of the}} three categories: mathematics, science, and reading. The Chinese students scored particularly well compared to other nations in mathematics. One explanation for the Chinese results may be a culture emphasizing education and competitive examinations and more time spent studying in part due to less participation in activities such as sports. Teaching have become a higher status occupation. Also, industrialized Shanghai which has done important educational reforms may not be representative for the rest of China. While {{there was no evidence of}} cheating or technical problems with the testing, Shanghai which attracts many immigrants from the rest of China may have allowed particularly good students to study in the city and the students may have been told that the test was important for China's image. The OECD director of the testing, Andreas Schleicher, said that the results were expected to produce astonishment and had been examined for accuracy by international experts after the OECD received the Shanghai scores. He also said that the results [...] "refute the commonly held hypothesis that China just produces rote learning" [...] and [...] "Large fractions of these students demonstrate their ability to extrapolate from what <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> apply their knowledge very creatively in novel situations".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that a particular}} advantage of plurality electoral systems such as first past the post, or majoritarian electoral systems such as the alternative vote, is the geographic link between representatives and their constituents. [...] A notable disadvantage of PR is that, as its multiple-member districts are made larger, this link is weakened. [...] In party list PR systems without delineated districts, such as the Netherlands and Israel, the geographic link between representatives and their constituents is considered extremely weak. [...] Yet with relatively small multiple-member districts, in particular with STV, there are counter-arguments: about 90% of voters can consult a representative they voted for, someone whom they might think more sympathetic to their problem. In such cases it is sometimes argued that constituents and representatives have a closer link; constituents {{have a choice of}} representative so they can consult one with particular expertise in the topic at issue. [...] With multiple-member districts, prominent candidates have more opportunity to be elected in their home constituencies, which <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> can represent authentically. There is less likely to be a strong incentive to parachute them into constituencies in which they are strangers and thus less than ideal representatives. [...] Mixed-member PR systems incorporate single-member districts to preserve the link between constituents and representatives. However because up to half the parliamentary seats are list rather than district seats, the districts are necessarily up to twice as large as with a plurality/majoritarian system where all representatives serve single-member districts.|$|E
