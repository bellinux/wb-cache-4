2500|$|Polyester film {{capacitors}} are film capacitors using a dielectric {{made of the}} thermoplastic polar polymer material {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET), trade names Hostaphan or Mylar®, from the polyester family. [...] They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. The polyester film adsorbs very little moisture, and this feature makes it suitable for [...] "naked" [...] designs without any further coating needed. They are the low-cost mass-produced capacitors in modern electronics, featuring relatively small dimensions with relatively high capacitance values. [...] PET capacitors are mainly used as general purpose capacitors for DC applications, or for semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125 nbsp&°C. The maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>rating</b> of 125nbsp&°C also allows SMD film capacitors to be made with PET films. The low cost of polyester and the relatively compact dimensions are {{the main reasons for}} the high prevalence of PET film capacitors in modern designs.|$|E

50|$|Insulation is an {{important}} part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as firebrick, castable refractories and ceramic fibre, are used for insulation. The floor of the furnace are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place. Ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its density and then its maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>rating.</b> For example, 8# 2,300 °F means 8 lb/ft3 density with a maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>rating</b> of 2,300 °F.

30|$|<b>Temperature</b> {{increasing}} <b>rate</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in growth mechanism of CNTs, and proper experimentation was conducted to see its influence on the diameter, yield and structural quality of grown CNTs. Successful observations were made in these fronts simply by tuning the <b>temperature</b> increasing <b>rate.</b> At lesser <b>temperature</b> increasing <b>rate,</b> MWNTs are synthesized, whereas at higher <b>temperature</b> increasing <b>rate,</b> SWNTs are successfully achieved. We also conclude that for the growth of best quality CNTs with lesser diameter, the <b>temperature</b> increasing <b>rate</b> should be as much as possible. It was proved by the present study that the size of the catalyst does not play any role in deciding the diameter of CNTs. In support of this observation, experimental results demonstrate that diameter of CNT is much lesser than the diameter of the catalyst. The disorders present on the top surface of catalyst particles are actually responsible and the decisive factor for the diameter of grown CNTs.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the inter-ply shear {{behaviour}} of uncured {{carbon fibre}} prepreg {{is fundamental to}} avoiding process-induced defects during manufacturing of large-scale components.

The paper presents a methodol-ogy capable of determining the parameters of <b>temperature,</b> <b>rate</b> and pressure required for minimum resistance to movement of a prepreg. Investigating the joint strength and friction values individually shows that friction increases with temperature, contrary to previous work, and that the new value of joint strength is predominant at lower <b>temperatures.</b> <b>Rate</b> dependent variables are strongly linked to the resin behaviour, confirming {{the need for a}} viscoelastic model.

30|$|Another {{characteristic}} of the the temperature maxima was that it always followed the rate maxima by ~ 1 – 3 h. When the <b>temperature</b> <b>rate</b> reached its maximum it slowed down and crossed the x-axis at the <b>temperature</b> maximum.

The time lag between the <b>temperature</b> peak and <b>rate</b> maximum is only shown for 1 μM ASA treatment (Figure 5 A).

It also appears that when the rate peak at the ~ 23 h was high (D and E) the rate peak at ~ 17 h was low, and when the peak at ~ 17 was high (A) the peak at ~ 23 was relatively low. In (F) a rate maximum at 13 h was detected and it could be associated with the maximum at 17 h.|$|R
