One of the easiest procedures for gene manipula-tion in Escherichia coli is to place a drug resistance marker near, within, or in place of a cloned gene of interest. Linear DNA, containing the mutated or deleted gene flanked by ho-mologous regions of the chromosome, is then transformed or electroporated into recombination-proficient strains (i. e., recBC sbcBC or recD). Recombination between the bacterial chromosome and both ends of the linear DNA fragment re-sults in gene replacement (13, 19, 34, 46). The recombinant...|$|E
40|$|Most solid cancers contain {{regions of}} {{necrotic}} tissue. The extent of necrosis {{is associated with}} poor survival, most likely because it reflects aggressive tumour outgrowth and inflammation. Intravenously injected spores of anaerobic bacteria from the genus Clostridium infiltrate and selectively germinate in these necrotic regions, providing cancer-specific colonisation. The specificity of this system was first demonstrated over 60 years ago and evidence of colonisation has been confirmed in multiple tumour models. The use of “armed” clostridia, such as in Clostridium Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (CDEPT), may help to overcome some of the described deficiencies of using wild-type clostridia for treatment of cancer, such as tumour regrowth from a well-vascularised outer rim of viable cells. Successful preclinical evaluation of a <b>transferable</b> <b>gene</b> that metabolises both clinical stage positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents (for whole body vector visualisation) as well as chemotherapy prodrugs (for conditional enhancement of efficacy) would be a valuable early step towards the prospect of “armed” clostridia entering clinical evaluation. The ability to target the immunosuppressive hypoxic tumour microenvironment using CDEPT may offer potential for synergy with recently developed immunotherapy strategies. Ultimately, clostridia may be most efficacious when combined with conventional therapies, such as radiotherapy, that sterilise viable aerobic tumour cells...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{reduction}} of nitrate and nitrite is encoded in Thermus thermophilus by the respective <b>transferable</b> <b>gene</b> clusters. Nitrate is reduced by a heterotetrameric nitrate reductase (Nar) encoded along transporters and regulatory signal transduction systems within the nitrate respiration conjugative element (NCE). The nitrite respiration cluster (nic) encodes homologues of nitrite reductase (Nir) and nitric oxide reductase (Nor). The expression and role of the nirSJM genes in nitrite respiration were analyzed. The three genes are expressed from two promoters, one (nirSp) producing a tricistronic mRNA under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and the other (nirJp) producing a bicistronic mRNA only under conditions of anoxia plus a nitrogen oxide. As for its nitrite reductase homologues, NirS is expressed in the periplasm, has a covalently bound heme c, and conserves the heme d 1 binding pocket. NirJ is a cytoplasmic protein likely required for heme d 1 synthesis and NirS maturation. NirM is a soluble periplasmic homologue of cytochrome c 552. Mutants defective in nirS show normal anaerobic growth with nitrite and nitrate, supporting {{the existence of an}} alternative Nir in the cells. Gene knockout analysis of different candidate genes did not allow us to identify this alternative Nir protein but revealed the requirement for Nar in NirS-dependent and NirS-independent nitrite reduction. As the likely role for Nar in the process is in electron transport through its additional cytochrome c periplasmic subunit (NarC), we concluded all the Nir activity takes place in the periplasm by parallel pathways. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

This ca donor virus was mated with the A/Alaska/ 6 / 77 (H 3 N 2) wild-type virus, and three A/Alaska/ 6 / 77 (H 3 N 2) ca recombinant viruses were produced. The parental origin of the genes in the three ca recombinants had been determined previously (2), and their virulence for adult seronegative volunteers was assessed {{in the present study}} to identify the genes present in the ca donor virus that confer attenuation.

Over a 10 -year period from 2001 through 2010, a total of 92 MBL-producing P. aeruginosa urine isolates were collected from patients (one isolate per patient) who were admitted to 5 hospitals in Okayama Prefecture, Japan. When cross-infection was suspected in the hospital, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed. In the resulting dendrogram of 79 MBL-producing P. aeruginosa urine isolates, no identical isolates and 7 pairs of isolates with ≥ 80 % similarity were found.

Resistant isolates were identified in tests for trimethoprim or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) susceptibility. Resistant isolates were screened for the known horizontally transferable trimethoprim-insensitive dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes dfrG, dfrF, dfrA, dfrD, and dfrK. The nucleotide sequence of the intrinsic dfr gene was determined for resistant isolates lacking the horizontally <b>transferable</b> <b>genes.</b> Based on tentative criteria, 69 out of 268 isolates (25. 7 %) from India were resistant to trimethoprim. Occurring in 42 of the 69 resistant isolates (60. 9 %), dfrF appeared more frequently than dfrG (23 isolates; 33. 3 %) in India. The dfrF gene was also present in a collection of SXT-resistant isolates from Germany, in which it was the only detected trimethoprim resistance factor. The dfrF gene caused resistance in 4 out of 5 trimethoprim-resistant isolates from the German collection.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{burden of}} {{antimicrobial}} resistance worldwide is substantial {{and is likely}} to grow. Many factors {{play a role in the}} emergence of resistance. These resistance mechanisms may be encoded on <b>transferable</b> <b>genes,</b> which facilitate the spread of resistance between bacterial strains of the same and/or different species. Other resistance mechanisms may be due to alterations in the chromosomal DNA which enables the bacteria to withstand the environment and multiply. Many, if not most, of the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries do not have clear guidelines for antimicrobial use, and lack policies for restricting and auditing antimicrobial prescriptions. Objective The aim of this study is to review the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in GCC countries and explore the reasons for antibiotic resistance in the region. Methodology The PubMed database was searched using the following key words: antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic stewardship, prevalence, epidemiology, mechanism of resistance, and GCC country (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and United Arab Emirates). Results From January 1990 through April 2011, there were 45 articles published reviewing antibiotic resistance in the GCC countries. Among all the GCC countries, 37, 295 bacterial isolates were studied for antimicrobial resistance. The most prevalent microorganism was Escherichia coli (10, 073 / 44 %), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 709 / 20 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4, 287 / 18. 7 %), MRSA (1, 216 / 5. 4 %), Acinetobacter (1, 061 / 5 %), with C. difficile and Enterococcus representing less than 1 %.

Interestingly, kinetic studies for one of the functional mutants, Asn 233 Ala, indicate that an alanine substitution at this position significantly increases catalytic efficiency as compared with the wild-type enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Probiotics are {{increasingly}} used in aquaculture to control diseases and improve feed digestion and pond water quality; however, {{little is known}} about the antimicrobial resistance properties of such probiotic bacteria and to what extent they may contribute to the development of bacterial resistance in aquaculture ponds. Concerns have been raised that the declared information on probiotic product labels are incorrect and information on bacterial composition are often missing. We therefore evaluated seven probiotics commonly used in Vietnamese shrimp culture for their bacterial species content, phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and associated <b>transferable</b> resistance <b>genes.</b> The bacterial species was established by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis of 125 representative bacterial isolates. MIC testing was done for a range of antimicrobials and whole genome sequencing of six multiple antimicrobial resistant Bacillus spp. used to identify resistance genes and genetic elements associated with horizontal gene transfer. Thirteen bacterial species declared on the probiotic products could not be identified and 11 non-declared Bacillus spp. were identified. Although our culture-based isolation and identification may have missed a few bacterial species present in the tested products this would represent minor bias, but future studies may apply culture independent identification methods like pyro sequencing. Only 6 / 60 isolates were resistant to more than four antimicrobials and whole genome sequencing showed that they contained macrolide (ermD), tetracycline (tetL), phenicol (fexA) and trimethoprim (dfrD, dfrG and dfrK) resistance genes, but not known structures associated with horizontal gene transfer. Probiotic bacterial strains used in Vietnamese shrimp culture seem to contribute with very limited types and numbers of resistance genes compared to the naturally occurring bacterial species in aquaculture environments. Approval procedures of probiotic products must be strengthened through scientific-based efficacy trials and product labels should allow identification of individual bacterial strains and inform the farmer on specific purpose, dosage and correct application measures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{collection}} of 187 Enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from European cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (TC) resistance. A total of 45 isolates (24 %) encompassing the species Enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), E. durans (n = 7), E. faecium (n = 3), E. casseliflavus (n = 1), and E. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to TC with MIC ranges of 16 to 256 μg/ml. Eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to TC, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. By PCR detection, TC resistance could {{be linked to the}} presence of the tet(M) (n = 43), tet(L) (n = 16), and tet(S) (n = 1) genes. In 15 isolates, including all of those for which the MIC was 256 μg/ml, both tet(M) and tet(L) were found. Furthermore, all tet(M) -containing enterococci also harbored a member of the Tn 916 -Tn 1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(B) gene. Filter mating experiments revealed that 10 E. faecalis isolates, 3 E. durans isolates, and 1 E. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(M), tet(L), or both of these genes to E. faecalis recipient strain JH 2 - 2. In most cases in which only tet(M) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by JH 2 - 2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the Tn 916 -Tn 1545 family. Sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the <b>transferable</b> tet(M) <b>genes</b> belonged to four sequence homology groups (SHGs) showing an internal homology of ≥ 99. 6 %. Two of these SHGs contained tet(M) mosaic structures previously found in Tn 916 elements and on Lactobacillus and Neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two SHGs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene...|$|R
40|$|Copper, as copper sulfate, {{is often}} used as an {{alternative}} to in-feed antibiotics for growth promotion in both swine and cattle diets. Gut bacteria exposed to copper can acquire resistance, which among enterococci is conferred by a plasmid-borne <b>transferable</b> copper resistance <b>gene</b> (tcrB). The plasmid also carries tetracycline [tet(M) ] and macrolide [erm(B) ] resistance genes. Because of the genetic link between acquired copper (tcrB) and antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus spp., we hypothesized that copper supplementation may exert selection pressure for enterococci to become resistant to macrolides and tetracyclines, and possibly to other antibiotics. We conducted studies in cattle and swine to investigate the relationship between copper supplementation and the fecal prevalence of tcrB-positive enterococci, as well as its potential co-selection for macrolide and tetracycline resistance. The prevalence was higher in animals fed diets supplemented with elevated level of copper compared to normal level (P < 0. 05). The tcrB-positive isolates belonged to either E. faecium or E. faecalis; the majority was E. faecium. All tcrB-positive isolates also contained both erm(B) and tet(M) genes; however, none of them harbored the vanA gene. Median minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAntibiotic resistance, {{including}} multiresistance {{acquisition and}} dissemination by pathogens, {{is a critical}} healthcare issue threatening our management of infectious diseases [1 - 3]. Rapid accumulation of resistance phenotypes implies a reservoir of <b>transferable</b> antibiotic resistance <b>gene</b> determinants (ARGDs) selected in response to inhibition of antibiotic concentrations, as found in hospitals [1, 3 - 5]. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in environmental isolates, soil DNA [4 - 6], secluded caves [6, 7], and permafrost DNA [7, 8]. Antibiotics target essential and ubiquitous cell functions, and resistance is a common characteristic of environmental bacteria [8 - 11]. Environmental ARGDs are an abundant reservoir of potentially transferable resistance for pathogens [9 - 12]. Using metagenomic sequences, we show that ARGDs can be detected in all (n = 71) environments analyzed. Soil metagenomes had the most diverse pool of ARGDs. The most common types of resistances found in environmental metagenomes were efflux pumps and genes conferring resistance to vancomycin, tetracycline, or β-lactam antibiotics used in veterinary and human healthcare. Our study describes the diverse and abundant antibiotic resistance genes in nonclinical environments and shows that these genes are not randomly distributed among different environments (e. g., soil, oceans or human feces) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{deletion}} of {{amino acids}} {{is one of}} the evolutionary mechanisms by which nature adapts the function of proteins. A simple method has been developed that mimics this event in vitro by introducing a deletion of exactly three nucleotides at random positions in a target gene. The method involved the engineering of the mini-Mu transposon to introduce a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme MlyI. The new transposon, MuDel, was capable of efficient insertion into a target DNA sequence. To determine the efficacy of the method, the bla gene that encodes the TEM- 1 ÃŸ-lactamase was used as the target and a small library containing 22 different sequence variants was created. Of these 22 variants, 8 were identified that conferred resistance to ampicillin on Escherichia coli. Each of the TEM- 1 variants possessed a distinct ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentration, ranging from 500 to > 10 000 Âµg/ml. Sequence analysis revealed that active TEM- 1 variants contained deletions not just in loops but also helices, and included regions known to be involved in catalysis, antibiotic resistance and inhibitor binding. This new technology is <b>transferable</b> to most <b>genes,</b> permitting an extensive analysis of deletion mutations on protein function...|$|R
