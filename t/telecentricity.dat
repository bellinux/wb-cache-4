50|$|In imaging optics, a {{field lens}} is a positive-powered lens {{or group of}} lenses that comes after the {{objective}} lens and before the image plane or the eyepiece, serving to change {{the size of the}} image, or to provide image-space <b>telecentricity.</b>|$|E
50|$|In an {{alignment}} telescope, {{the precise}} micrometric {{measurement of the}} eyepiece image directly indicates the real distance of a nearby observed point from the line of sight. This absolute measurement is independent of {{the distance to the}} object, due to the <b>telecentricity</b> principle.|$|E
50|$|Telecentric lenses {{tend to be}} larger, heavier, {{and more}} {{expensive}} than normal lenses of similar focal length and f-number. This {{is partly due to}} the extra components needed to achieve <b>telecentricity,</b> and partly because the object or image lens elements of an object or image-space telecentric lens must be at least as large as the largest object to be photographed or image to be formed. , these lenses can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of US dollars or euros, depending on quality. Because of their intended applications, telecentric lenses often have higher resolution and transmit more light than normal photographic lenses.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the conception {{and implementation of}} a variable diameter ring-cutting system for a CO 2 laser with a working wavelength of 10. 6 μm. The laser-cutting system is adapted to an observation zoom microscope for combined use and is applicable for the extraction of small circular areas from polymer films, such as forensic adhesive tapes in a single shot. As an important characteristic for our application, the variable diameter ring-cutting system provides <b>telecentricity</b> in the target area. Ring diameters are continuously tunable between 500 μm and 2 mm. A minimum width of less than 20 μm was found for the ring profile edge. The basic characteristics of the system, including <b>telecentricity,</b> were experimentally evaluated and demonstrated by cutting experiments on different polymer tapes and further exemplary samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of lens design {{features}} broadband achromatic performance as well as <b>telecentricity,</b> using a minimum number of spherical elements. With appropriate modifications, the lens design form can be tailored to cover the range of response of the focal-plane array, from Si (400 - 1, 000 nm) to InGaAs (400 - 1, 700 or 2, 100 nm) or InSb/HgCdTe reaching to 2, 500 nm. For reference, lenses typically are achromatized over the visible wavelength range of 480 - 650 nm. In remote sensing applications, {{there is a need}} for broadband achromatic telescopes, normally satisfied with mirror-based systems. However, mirror systems are not always feasible due to size or geometry restrictions. They also require expensive aspheric surfaces. Non-obscured mirror systems can be difficult to align and have a limited (essentially one-dimensional) field of view. Centrally obscured types have a two-dimensional but very limited field in addition to the obscuration. <b>Telecentricity</b> is a highly desirable property for matching typical spectrometer types, as well as for reducing the variation of the angle of incidence and cross-talk on the detector for simple camera types. This rotationally symmetric telescope with no obscuration and using spherical surfaces and selected glass types fills a need in the range of short focal lengths. It can be used as a compact front unit for a matched spectrometer, as an ultra-broadband camera objective lens, or as the optics of an integrated camera/spectrometer in which the wavelength information is obtained by the use of strip or linear variable filters on the focal plane array. This kind of camera and spectrometer system can find applications in remote sensing, as well as in-situ applications for geological mapping and characterization of minerals, ecological studies, and target detection and identification through spectral signatures. Commercially, the lens can be used in quality-control applications via spectral analysis. The lens design is based on the rear landscape lens with the aperture stop in front of all elements. This allows sufficient room for <b>telecentricity</b> in addition to making the stop easily accessible. The crucial design features are the use of a doublet with an ultra-low dispersion glass (fluorite or S-FPL 53), and the use of a strong negative element, which enables flat field and <b>telecentricity</b> in conjunction with the last (field lens) element. The field lens also can be designed to be in contact with the array, a feature that is desirable in some applications. The lens has a 20 deg field of view, for a 50 -mm focal length, and is corrected over the range of wavelengths of 450 - 2, 300 nm. Transverse color, which is the most pernicious aberration for spectroscopic work, is controlled at the level of 1 m or below at 0. 7 m field and 5 m at full field. The maximum chief ray angle is less than 1. 7, providing good <b>telecentricity.</b> An additional feature of this lens is that it is made exclusively with glasses that provide good transmission up to 2, 300 nm and even some transmission to 2, 500 nm; thus, the lens can be used in applications that cover the entire solar-reflected spectrum. Alternative realizations are possible that provide enhanced resolution and even less transverse color over a narrower wavelength range...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} method for the {{automatic}} computation of high-order optical aberration coefficients to include (1) a finite object distance and (2) an infinite entrance pupil position (<b>telecentricity</b> in object space). We present coefficients {{of the power}} series expansion of the transverse aberration vector {{with respect to the}} normalized aperture and field coordinates. Aberration coefficients of very high order (e. g., 21) can be computed easily and—as shown by comparisons with trigonometric ray tracing—reliably. Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E

The considered mask options include standard binary masks, standard attenuated phase-shift masks, etched attenuated phase-shift masks and embedded-shifter phase-shift masks. The lithographic performance of these masks is investigated and optimized in terms of mask efficiency, NILS, DoF, OPC-performance and <b>telecentricity</b> errors.

This article applies rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) simulation in combination with accurate projection image modeling to explore the impact of typical mask geometry parameters {{on the characteristics of}} lithographic processes. This includes <b>telecentricity</b> and shadowing effects resulting from the off-axis illumination in EUV systems and mask induced aberration-like effects.

30|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy is used for intraoral scanner systems [28]. This technique is used to acquire in-focus images from selected depths, {{a process known as}} optical sectioning (high-resolution optical images with depth selectivity) [29]. The iTero scanner employs a parallel confocal imaging technique with an array of incident red laser beams [30]. It is important to maintain the scanning wand at a certain focal distance while scanning. The TRIOS intraoral system also works according to the principle of confocal microscopy, with a fast scanning time. A fundamental characteristic of the TRIOS system is the variation of the focal plane without moving the scanner toward the subject being scanned [30]. The TRIOS system has the feature of <b>telecentricity</b> in the space of the subject being scanned, and it is possible to shift the focal plane while keeping <b>telecentricity</b> and magnification ratio [30]. We evaluated the light wave of the iTero and TRIOS scanners using polarization beam splitter and quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs Inc., Newton, NJ). It was found that the light of the TRIOS scanner was polarized, whereas the light of the iTero scanner was not polarized. The TRIOS scanner was found to use linear-to-circular polarization by the quarter-wave plate. A wave plate is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave traveling through it. Two common types of wave plates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa [31]. In consideration of the polarization system of the TRIOS scanner, which might block the scattered reflections, this scanner might have better optical performance than iTero.|$|E

The results indicated that defocus errors arising from imperfections in the ophthalmophakometer camera <b>telecentricity</b> and light source collimation were smaller than experimental errors. Reasonable estimates emerged for anterior lens surface radius of curvature (accuracy: 0. 02 – 0. 10 mm; precision 0. 05 – 0. 09 mm), posterior lens surface radius of curvature (accuracy: 0. 10 – 0. 55 mm; precision 0. 06 – 0. 20 mm), eye rotation (accuracy: 0. 00 – 0. 32 °; precision 0. 06 – 0. 25 °), lens tilt (accuracy: 0. 00 – 0. 33 °; precision 0. 05 – 0. 98 °) and lens decentration (accuracy: 0. 00 – 0. 07 mm; precision 0. 00 – 0. 07 mm) ...|$|E
40|$|Next-generation pushbroom sensors for earth {{observation}} require high-performance optics {{that provide}} high spatial resolution over wide fields of view. Specifically, blur diameters {{on the order}} of 10 to 15 microns are needed over 5 to 15 deg fields. In addition to this fundamental level of optical performance, other characteristics, such as spatial coregistration of spectral bands, flat focal plane, <b>telecentricity,</b> and workable pupil location are significant instrument design considerations. The detector-assembly design, optical line-of-sight pointing method and sensor packaging all hinge on these secondary attributes. Moreover, the need for broad spectral coverage, ranging from 0. 4 to 12. 5 microns, places an additional constraint on optical design. This paper presents alternative design forms that are candidates for wide-field pushbroom sensors, and discusses the instrument-design tradeoffs that are linked to the selection of these alternate optical approaches...|$|E
40|$|An optical {{approach}} to constant-magnification imaging is described. Magnification variations due {{to changes in}} focus setting pose problems for pertinent vision techniques, such as, depth from defocus. It is shown that magnification of a conventional lens can be made invariant to defocus by simply adding an aperture at an analytically derived location. The resulting optical configuration is called "telecentric. " It is shown that most commercially available lenses {{can be turned into}} telecentric ones. The procedure for calculating the position of the additional aperture is outlined. The photometric and geometric properties of telecentric lenses are discussed in detail. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>telecentricity.</b> 1 Introduction The problem of magnification variation due to change in focus setting has significance in machine vision.

This {{type of a}} telescope is commonly employed in the measurement of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, which requires an image-space telecentric telescope with a large focal plane over broadband coverage. We report {{the design of the}} wide field-of-view crossed Dragone optical system using the anamorphic aspherical surfaces with correction terms up to the 10 th order. We achieved the Strehl ratio larger than 0. 95 over 32 by 18 square degrees at 150 GHz. This design is an image-space telecentric and fully diffraction-limited system below 400 GHz. We discuss the optical performance in the uniformity of the axially symmetric point spread function and <b>telecentricity</b> over the field-of-view. We also address the analysis to evaluate the polarization properties, including the instrumental polarization, extinction rate, and polarization angle rotation. This work is a part of programs to design a compact multi-color wide field-of-view telescope for LiteBIRD, which is a next generation CMB polarization satellite.

40|$|A simple {{benchtop}} apparatus {{has been}} built, {{to measure the}} x-ray imaging properties of fluorozirconate-based glassceramic x-ray storage phosphor materials. The MTF degradation due to stimulating light spreading in the plate is lower in comparison to optically turbid screens resulting in higher image MTF. In addition, the degree of transparency, or the amount of light scattering at the wavelength of the stimulating (laser) light is adjustable {{by means of the}} glass preparation process. The amount of stimulating exposure required for plate readout is generally higher than in previous systems, but well within the range of commercially available laser systems, for practical readout times. The effects of flare or unwanted readout due to back-reflection from the imaging plate is also less than in previous systems. A novel telecentric scanning system has been developed that is able to rapidly read out the latent image stored in the translucent imaging plates. This system features a reflective primary scan mirror to achieve <b>telecentricity,</b> optical correction for scan line bow, and the design should enable the construction of a relatively inexpensive scanner system for the translucent x-ray storage plates...|$|E
40|$|The {{reflection}} and diffraction of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from lithographic masks and the projection imaging of these masks by all-reflective systems introduce several significant imaging artifacts. The off-axis illumination {{of the mask}} causes asymmetric shadowing, a size bias between features with different orientations and <b>telecentricity</b> errors. The image contrast varies with the feature orientation and can easily drop far below intuitively expected values. The deformation of the wavefront or phase of the incident light by thick absorbers generates aberration-like effects, especially variations of the best-focus (BF) position vs. the pitch {{and size of the}} imaged patterns. Partial reflection of light {{from the top of the}} absorber generates a weak secondary image, which superposes with the main image. Based on a discussion of the root causes of these phenomena, we employ mask diffraction and imaging analysis for a quantitative analysis of these effects for standa rd EUV masks. Simulations for various non-standard types of mask stacks (e. g. etched multilayers, buried shifters, etc.) and for various non-standard absorber materials are used to explore the imaging capabilities of alternative masks for EUV lithography. Finally, an outlook at anamorphic systems for larger numerical apertures is given...|$|E
40|$|As the {{opportunities}} for experimental studies are still limited, a predictive simulation of EUV lithography {{is very important for}} {{a better understanding of the}} technology. One of the most critical issues in modeling of EUV lithography is the description of the mask. Typical absorber heights in the range between 80 and 100 nm are more than 5 times larger than the wavelength of the used EUV radiation. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to perform parameter studies for 3 D EUV masks, such as arrays of contacts or posts, with nowadays standard computers by straightforward application of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithms, which are used for the rigorous electromagnetic field simulation of optical masks. This paper discusses the application of field decomposition techniques for an efficient simulation of 3 D EUV-masks with FDTD algorithms. Comparisons with full 3 D simulations are used to evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the proposed approach. The application of the new QUASI 3 D rigorous electromagnetic field simulation for EUV masks reduces memory requirements and computing time by a factor of at least 100. The implemented simulation approach is applied for a first exploration of mask induced imaging artifacts such as placement errors, <b>telecentricity</b> errors, Bossung asymmetries, and focus shifts for 3 D EUV masks...|$|E
40|$|For the {{projection}} lithography, off-axis illumination {{has become one}} important resolution enhancement technique, which can also increase the depth of focus. It is realized by the pupil shaping unit to change the partial coherence factor. The pupil shaping unit is composed of a zoom system, diffractive optical elements (DOE) and axicons. By changing the focal length of the zoom system, a continuously adjustable diameter of the pupil is achieved. For the zoom system, its front focal plane and the back focal plane must be fixed and the <b>telecentricity</b> should be maintained {{in the process of}} zoom. In this paper, a zoom system with a zoom ratio of eight is designed. The system comprises only five lenses. The first lens works as the front fixed group and the last lens works as the back fixed group. The second lens is the zoom group to achieve the desired focal length, while the third and fourth lenses constitute the compensatory group to compensate the image shift. To eliminate the aberrations and obtain a compact structure, these five lenses are aspherical lenses. By using the multi-configuration design of ZEMAX software, the system is optimized to have a high imaging quality. Under the working wavelength of 193. 368 nm, the modulation transfer function is close to the diffraction limit. With this zoom system, the pupil shaping unit is simulated using ASAP software. The simulation results show that this zoom system can meet the requirement of pupil shaping of the lithography tool...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{microbeam}} {{radiation therapy}} (MRT) {{is a novel}} form of treatment, currently in its preclinical stage, which uses microplanar x-ray beams from a synchrotron radiation source. It is important to perform accurate dosimetry on these microbeams, but, to date, {{there has been no}} accurate enough method available for making 3 D dose measurements with isotropic, high spatial resolution to verify the results of Monte Carlo dose simulations. Here, we investigate the potential of optical computed tomography for satisfying these requirements. The construction of a simple optical CT microscopy (optical projection tomography) system from standard commercially available hardware is described. The measurement of optical densities in projection data is shown to be highly linear (r 2 = 0. 999). The depth-of-field (DOF) of the imaging system is calculated based on the previous literature and measured experimentally using a commercial DOF target. It is shown that high quality images can be acquired despite the evident lack of <b>telecentricity</b> and despite DOF of the system being much lower than the sample diameter. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Results are presented for a complex irradiation of a 22 mm diameter cylinder of the radiochromic polymer PRESAGE, demonstrating the exquisite 'dose-painting' abilities available in the MRT hutch of beamline ID- 17 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Dose distributions in this initial experiment are equally well resolved on both an optical CT scan and a corresponding transmission image of radiochromic film, down to a line width of 83 microm (6 lp mm(- 1)) with an MTF value of 0. 40. A group of 33 microm wide lines was poorly resolved on both the optical CT and film images, and this is attributed to an incorrect exposure time calculation, leading to under-delivery of dose. Image artefacts in the optical CT scan are discussed. PRESAGE irradiated using the microbeam facility is proposed as a suitable material for producing phantom samples for quantitative characterization of optical CT microscopy systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} {{of most of}} alignment systems for optical lithography is based on image processingof target alignment marks on the wafer under bright-field illumination. To satisfy the increasingdemand for extremely tight overlay accuracy in semiconductor manufacturing processes, all themeasurement error factors in alignment measurement system need be identified and eliminated. Theobjective of this dissertation {{is to improve the}} accuracy of wafer alignment in semiconductorexposure tools for optical lithography. Chapter 1 describes the background and the outline of this study. For preliminaries, thestate-of-art and future semiconductor manufacturing technologies are introduced referring toInternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), and the process of semiconductormanufacturing and lithography technologies are reviewed. Chapter 2 also serves as preliminaries to provide knowledge relevant to the subjects of thedissertation. Explanations are given on a semiconductor exposure tool called as a stepper or ascanner, wafer measurement systems, a focus measurement system, an alignment measurementsystem, and the sequence of semiconductor exposure. Finally, to clarify the issues to be discussed,error factors of alignment measurement system are identified and categorized. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 constitute {{the main part of the}} dissertation, and describe the mostimportant outcome of this thesis work. In Chapter 3, error analysis is given to the alignmentmeasurement system of a semiconductor exposure tool. First, an overlay error budget is discussed andthe required accuracy of overlay is quantified. Then, error analysis is given to Tool Induced Shift（TIS）and Wafer Induced Shift（WIS）, and the importance of TIS-WIS interaction is clarified. Asimple physical model is proposed that can explain the behavior of TIS, and the results ofexperiments and simulations are presented that demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. InChapter 4, new improvement methods are proposed that can solve not only the TIS problem but alsothe WIS problem. As a solution to the TIS problem, a new criterion is proposed to quantify bothcomatic aberrations and the deviation from illumination <b>telecentricity</b> in alignment optics. To solvethe WIS problem, asymmetry of an alignment mark is quantified, and offset control for the alignmentmeasurement system of semiconductor exposure tool is determined by using an atomic forcemicroscope and an optical simulator. This method is referred to as Alignment Offset Analyzer. Finally Chapter 5 gives the summary and the conclusions of the dissertation. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E
40|$|Optical-CT {{has been}} shown to be a {{potentially}} useful imaging tool for for the two very different spheres of biologists and radiation therapy physicists, but it has yet to live up to that potential. In radiation therapy, researchers have used optical-CT for the readout of 3 D dosimeters, but it is yet to be a clinically relevant tool as the technology is too slow to be considered practical. Biologists have used the technique for structural imaging, but have struggled with emission tomography as the reality of photon attenuation for both excitation and emission have made the images quantitatively irrelevant. Dosimetry. The DLOS (Duke Large field of view Optical-CT Scanner) was designed and constructed to make 3 D dosimetry utilizing optical-CT a fast and practical tool while maintaining the accuracy of readout of the previous, slower readout technologies. Upon construction/optimization/implementation of several components including a diffuser, band pass filter, registration mount & fluid filtration system the dosimetry system provides high quality data comparable to or exceeding that of commercial products. In addition, a stray light correction algorithm was tested and implemented. The DLOS in combination with the 3 D dosimeter it was designed for, PREAGETM, then underwent rigorous commissioning and benchmarking tests validating its performance against gold standard data including a set of 6 irradiations. DLOS commissioning tests resulted in sub-mm isotropic spatial resolution (MTF > 0. 5 for frequencies of 1. 5 lp/mm) and a dynamic range of ~ 60 dB. Flood field uniformity was 10 % and stable after 45 minutes. Stray light proved to be small, due to <b>telecentricity,</b> but even the residual can be removed through deconvolution. Benchmarking tests showed the mean 3 D passing gamma rate (3 %, 3 mm, 5 % dose threshold) over the 6 benchmark data sets was 97. 3 % ± 0. 6 % (range 96 %- 98 %) scans totaling ~ 10 minutes, indicating excellent ability to perform 3 D dosimetry while improving the speed of readout. Noise was low at ~ 2 % for 2 mm reconstructions. The DLOS/PRESAGE® benchmark tests show consistently excellent performance, with very good agreement to simple known distributions. The telecentric design was critical to enabling fast (~ 15 mins) imaging with minimal stray light artifacts. The system produces accurate isotropic 2 mm 3 dose data over clinical volumes (e. g. 16 cm diameter phantoms, 12 cm height), and represents a uniquely useful and versatile new tool for commissioning complex radiotherapy techniques. The system also has wide versatility, and has successfully been used in preliminary tests with protons and with kV irradiations. Biology. Attenuation corrections for optical-emission-CT were done by modeling physical parameters in the imaging setup within the framework of an ordered subset expectation maximum (OSEM) iterative reconstruction algorithm. This process has a well documented history in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), but is inherently simpler due to the lack of excitation photons to account for. Excitation source strength distribution, excitation and emission attenuation were modeled. The accuracy of the correction was investigated by imaging phantoms containing known distributions of attenuation and fluorophores. The correction was validated on a manufactured phantom designed to give uniform emission in a central cuboidal region and later applied to a cleared mouse brain with GFP (green-fluorescent-protein) labeled vasculature and a cleared 4 T 1 xenograft flank tumor with constitutive RFP (red-fluorescent-protein). Reconstructions were compared to corresponding slices imaged with a fluorescent dissection microscope. Significant optical-ECT attenuation artifacts were observed in the uncorrected phantom images and appeared up to 80 % less intense than the verification image in the central region. The corrected phantom images showed excellent agreement with the verification image with only slight variations. The corrected tissue sample reconstructions showed general agreement between the verification images. Comprehensive modeling in optical-ECT imaging was successfully implemented, creating quantitatively accurate 3 D fluorophore distributions. This work represents the 1 st successful attempt encompassing such a complete set of corrections. This method provides a means to accurately obtain 3 D fluorophore distributions with the potential to better understand tumor biology and treatment responses. Dissertatio...|$|E
