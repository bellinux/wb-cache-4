To analyze the composition of the archaeal community, (their temporal variation inside the tailing and spatial variations all along the Reigous Creek, which drains the site), seven 16 S rRNA gene libraries were constructed.

5000|$|Human {{activities}} {{accounts for}} about 1/3 of right whale mortalities. [...] Mortalities caused by ships {{are one of the}} main threats right whales face. A collision with a vessel may result in fractured bones, crushed skulls, severed <b>tail</b> <b>stocks,</b> internal hemorrhaging, and deep propeller wounds. [...] From 1971 to 2011, 91 North Atlantic right whale deaths occurred due to ship strikes, entanglements, or unknown causes. Thirty-one of those deaths were attributed to ship strikes. North Atlantic right whales are more vulnerable to ship strikes than other whales because right whales spend more time in coastal areas at the surface of the ocean and do not exhibit vessel-avoidance behavior. [...] In addition, majority of ship strike victims are females. Although it is uncertain why this is so, it is hypothesized that it is because pregnant females and females with calves spend more time at the surface where they are more vulnerable to ship strikes.|$|R

50|$|Lobtailing is {{the act of}} a whale or dolphin lifting its fluke out of {{the water}} and then {{bringing}} them down onto the surface of the water hard and fast in order to make a loud slap. Large whales tend to lobtail by positioning themselves vertically downwards into the water and then slapping the surface by bending the <b>tail</b> <b>stock.</b> Dolphins, however, tend to remain horizontal, either on their belly or their back, and make the slap via a jerky whole body movement. All species are likely to slap several times in a single session. Like breaching, lobtailing is common amongst active cetacean species such as sperm, humpback, right and grey whales. It is less common, but still occasionally occurs, amongst the other large whales. Porpoises and river dolphins rarely lobtail, but it is a very common phenomenon amongst oceanic dolphins. Lobtailing is more common within species that have a complex social order than those where animals are more likely to be solitary. Lobtaling often occurs in conjunction with other aerial behaviour such as breaching. Species with large flippers may also slap them against the water for a similar effect, known as pectoral slapping.|$|E
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and <b>tail</b> <b>stock</b> pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the finance}} literature, {{cross-sectional}} dependence in extreme returns of risky assets is often modelled implicitly assuming an asymptotically dependent structure. If the true dependence structure is asymptotically independent then current modelling approaches {{will lead to}} an over-estimation {{of the risk of}} simul-taneous extreme events. We use two simple nonparametric measures to identify and quantify the <b>tail</b> dependence among <b>stock</b> returns in five international stock markets. We show that there is strong evidence in favour of asymptotically inde-pendent models for the <b>tail</b> structure of <b>stock</b> market returns, and that most of the extremal dependence is due to heteroskedasticity in stock returns processes. Using a range of volatility filters, we find that tail index and tail dependence can be partially captured by models for heteroskedasticity. We find there is no clear reason to prefer one volatility filter over another...|$|R

50|$|The striped dolphin has {{a similar}} size and shape to several other {{dolphins}} that inhabit the waters it does (see pantropical spotted dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, Clymene dolphin). However, its colouring is very different and makes it relatively easy to notice at sea. The underside is blue, white, or pink. One or two black bands circle the eyes, and then run across the back, to the flipper. These bands widen to {{the width of the}} flipper which are the same size. Two further black stripes run from behind the ear — one is short and ends just above the flipper. The other is longer and thickens along the flanks until it curves down under the belly just prior to the <b>tail</b> <b>stock.</b> Above these stripes, the dolphin's flanks are coloured light blue or grey. All appendages are black, as well. At birth, individuals weigh about 10 kg (22 lb) and are up to a meter (3 feet) long. By adulthood, they have grown to 2.4 m (8 ft) (females) or 2.6 m (8.5 ft) (males) and weigh 150 kg (330 lb) (female) or 160 kg (352 lb) (male). Research suggested sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in Mediterranean females and in the Pacific at between seven and 9 years. Longevity is about 55-60 years. Gestation lasts about 12 months, with a three- or four-year gap between calving.|$|E
50|$|At 5am sharp on Sunday 16th August, {{the team}} set off {{once again to}} locate Nettie and quickly found the animal some 18km away from where it was tagged the {{following}} night. Now the operation had to start over again, trying to exhaust the animal {{and bring it to}} the surface and ideally to a dead stop. Nettie was as determined and as feisty as the previous day and again several hours of Nantucket Sleigh rides continued, but whilst it was evident that Nettie was tiring, it was obvious that the already exhausted team could not sustain a prolonged operation of this magnitude and that the team would tire before the whale did. A regroup was called so that a new strategy could be formulated. The team came up with a new method of attaching a large 4 foot buoy just behind the tail which it was hoped would stop the animal from diving and bring it to the surface for longer periods giving the team more opportunities to cut the line as the whale presented its tail. A new rig was quickly assembled on board the MV Elding using existing elements of the team's disentanglement equipment and off they went for several more Nantucket sleighrides. The new rig was proving very difficult and quite dangerous to get a decent attachment with Nettie trying to pull the inflatable under on several attempts, but eventually the team managed to attach the rig to within a metre of the whale's tail and the buoy was quickly pulled into position using the ingenious pulley arrangement they had constructed.The new rig had the desired effect and prevented the whale from diving and also had the unplanned benefit of providing a new separate control line which the team could utilise. The original control and trailing line with 3 kegging buoys attached and covered in potential snagging points and mono filament net which had been causing the team no end of grief through out the operation was discarded and left to trail harmlessly beside the inflatable. The team were now able to pull themselves up to within a metre of the thrashing tail, and each time the whale's tail would breach the surface, careful cuts would be made using the equipment. Eventually the team managed to cut the lines {{on both sides of the}} <b>tail</b> <b>stock</b> and the trailing line from underneath and Nettie swam free from the almost certain fatal entanglement. Pieces of rope remain on the animal as the entanglement was so severe with rope embedded deep into its <b>tail</b> <b>stock,</b> but it is expected that this rope will be expelled from the wounds during the healing process as has been documented on several previous post entanglement events on whales. An additional bridle remains from Nettie's head that runs through its mouth, but with both ends cut it is also expected that this will be expelled over time, possibly during feeding.|$|E
5000|$|Three of BDMLR's {{trustees}} and directors, Ali Jack, Mark Stevens and Geoff Hammock, flew to Reykjavik on Friday 14th August and were joined there by Brian Sharp from IFAW in the US. With over 40 whale disentanglement rescues under his belt, his {{knowledge and skills}} would be invaluable. The following day, the team {{went out into the}} bay on one of the Elding Whale Watching boats, supported by an array of other local boats and a Coast Guard patrol vessel. The flotilla set course for the last known position of the whale from the previous day. Several hours were spent searching for the whale until the call came from another of Elding's boats that they had the whale in their sight. The whale, whilst hampered by the fishing gear wrapped around its <b>tail</b> <b>stock,</b> body and through its mouth, was busy feeding and the rescue team then spent four hours playing cat and mouse (rather big mouse!) with it, working from a small Zodiac inflatable while they attempted to grapple the trailing line coming from the whale's tail. With the assistance of the support team on board the MV Elding the team were able to predict where the whale would surface for a breath and after several close intercepts struck it lucky and managed to get into a position, allowing them to throw a grapple that caught the line and then deploy their own lines, kegging buoys. The buoys help to slow the whale down, keep it surfacing and hopefully tire it.For the next 5 hours the whale didn't help as the team tried time and time again to pull the inflatable up the line toward the whale's tail to start the process of cutting lines on the animal using their specialist equipment. This operation involves 'Nantucket sleigh rides' where the inflatable is pulled along at several knots with its outboard engine {{up and out of the}} water, with the inflatable only being attached to the whale by the team member in the bow holding the rope. The rope cannot be tied to the inflatable as if the whale dived it would take the inflatable under along with the team into a potential nest of sub surface entanglement that would immediately drown anyone who entered the water. On several occasions [...] "Nettie" [...] would try to shake the team off by diving deep pulling the bow of the inflatable underwater, however the quick reactions of the team averted disaster time and time again by letting the rope go just in time. This is without doubt the most dangerous type of rescue the charity engages in and it is not one for the faint-hearted.Over the course of the Nantuckets the team would pull the inflatable up to within a metre of the thrashing tail of this frightened and confused gigantic animal travelling at speed and would start to cut the line as the tail would breach the water. Several crucial cuts to the entangled line were made, however with darkness falling and utter exhaustion overcoming the team, the kegging buoys were cut off and a satellite telemetry buoy was fitted to the control line so that Nettie could be tracked over night and of course found again the following day.|$|E

Here, we present {{a survey of the}} archaeal community in the sediment and its temporal variation using a culture-independent approach by cloning of 16 S rRNA encoding genes. The taxonomic affiliation of Archaea showed a low degree of biodiversity with two different phyla: Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota.

Many sequences were phylogenetically related to the order Thermoplasmatales represented by aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, thermoacidophilic autotrophic or heterotrophic organisms like the organotrophic genus Thermogymnomonas. Some members of Thermoplasmatales can also derive energy from sulfur/iron oxidation or reduction. We also found microorganisms affiliated with methanogenic Archaea (Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis), which are involved in the carbon cycle. Some sequences affiliated with ammonia oxidizers, involved in the first and rate-limiting step in nitrification, a key process in the nitrogen cycle were also observed, including Candidatus Nitrososphaera viennensis and Candidatus nitrosopumilus sp. These results suggest that Archaea may be important players in the Reigous sediments through their participation in the biochemical cycles of elements, including those of carbon and nitrogen...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} evidence of heavy <b>tails</b> in <b>stock</b> return data is recognised by risk managers {{as an important}} factor in assessing the Value-at-Risk and risk profile of investment portfolios. Tail index estimation appears to be a tailor-made tool for estimating the extreme quantiles of heavy tailed distributions, as it exploits the information provided by the extreme observations. The tail shape of heavy tailed distributions resembles-to a first approximation-the hyperbolic shape of the Pareto distribution characterised by the so-called tail index. Ususally, a Hill-type estimator is used to estimate this tail index. This paper takes a new approach that hinges to a lesser extent on the choice of the treshold level and is easier to apply, by estimating the tail shape via least squares.
