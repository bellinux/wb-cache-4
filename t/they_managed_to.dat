5|$|Flashbang Studios {{had planned}} to earn money from {{creating}} casual games {{so that they could}} create a quirky game without having to worry about sales and sustaining the studio. Although the company failed to create a financially successful casual game, by creating software for other companies <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> acquire enough money to undertake an unusual project of their own choosing.|$|E
5|$|Norwich, {{then one}} of the largest and most {{important}} cities in the realm, was taken and occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of anyone they perceived as an enemy (such as poll tax collectors and important officials) once <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> enter the city.|$|E
5|$|On January 20, 1843, {{members of}} the Spanish Armed Forces' Tayabas Regiment {{stationed}} in Manila, led by Sergeant Irineo Samaniego, rose in mutiny {{in retaliation for the}} November 1841 massacre of the cofradía members. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> capture Fort Santiago and held it for a few hours, but were defeated the next day. Eighty-two mutineers were immediately executed on Bagumbayan Field, while the rest were imprisoned.|$|E

With dreams of becoming genuine detectives, the trio head for Squid McGuffy's cafe asking for the whereabouts of Dapper. <b>They</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> convince everyone at the restaurant that they are actually police.|$|R
5|$|On March 30, 1904, the ARF {{played a}} major role in the Sasun Uprising. The ARF sent arms and fedayi to defend the region for the second time. Among the 500 fedayees {{participating}} in the resistance were top figures such as Kevork Chavush, Sepasdatsi Murad and Hrayr Djoghk. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> hold off the Ottoman army for several months, despite their lack of fighters and firepower.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|Bayern {{got off to}} a {{good start}} under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E

5|$|Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Ottoman Turkish Empire {{experienced}} {{democracy and}} several political parties were created. However, {{some of the}} policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided {{for the creation of}} an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos {{assisted}} the Royal Navy {{in carrying out}} anti–shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were at anchor in the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando {{took part in a}} raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> sink several ships using limpet mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.|$|E

5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{make it to the}} country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|Instead he used guerrilla filmmaking techniques, which {{sometimes}} call for using locations without getting permission. Escape from Tomorrow {{is not the}} first film made in whole, or part, this way at the Disney parks. In 2010, the British street artist Banksy shot a scene for Exit Through the Gift Shop in one of the parks with his collaborator Mr. Brainwash. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a viral found footage short, Missing in the Mansion, filmed in the Haunted Mansion, was distributed online without interference from Disney.|$|E
5|$|Laurie Mains {{replaced}} Wyllie in 1992, and {{was given}} the job of preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. Their status as favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop goal.|$|E

5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{break out of}} the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which became the focus of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy. Their {{mission was to}} secure the left flank of the {{invasion}} zone, by occupying and dominating the high ground between the River Orne and the River Dives. Despite the parachute troops being widely scattered, <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> complete all of their objectives. After six days of counter-attacks by German armour and infantry, the division's position was secure {{by the end of}} the Battle of Breville on 12 June. Thereafter, they suffered only artillery bombardments.|$|E

5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.|$|E
5|$|The Aghlabids {{had tried}} and failed to take the city soon after their initial landing on the island in 827–828. Despite their repulse there, <b>they</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} themselves in the western portions of the island, and in the decades that followed they gradually pushed eastward into the central parts of Sicily. During this period they undertook repeated efforts to capture the capital of the Byzantine province, in 868, 869, and 873, but these failed as well.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. <b>They</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
