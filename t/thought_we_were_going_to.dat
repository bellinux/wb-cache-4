500|$|Anodyne was Uncle Tupelo's only {{recording}} {{to appear}} on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart. Despite the lack of a single to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in New York City. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, [...] "people here <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo." ...|$|E
500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. I think they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that." [...] Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration.|$|E

500|$|At first I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work on one song; {{that was}} the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and {{take it from there}} -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; {{it was the only thing}} she had to work on.|$|E
500|$|Collaborations include [...] "Matando", [...] "Rociarlos" [...] (also {{featuring}} Hector El Father) and [...] "Baila Así" [...] with Queen's then-husband, Gran Omar; {{a hip-hop}} track, [...] "Quítate Two", with Fat Joe; [...] "Acércate" [...] with Mikey Perfecto, [...] "Tócame" [...] with salsa singer La India and [...] "Vas A Morir" [...] with Puerto Rican duo Getto & Gastam. [...] "Soldados" [...] and [...] "Dee Jay" [...] were co-written with Kasseem Dean and Omar Navarro, respectively. [...] "People <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a salsa track", Queen {{said about the}} collaboration with La India, noting that the song was a dancehall track (not salsa or reggaetón). She added that India was [...] "original" [...] and she worked well {{with people who are}} genuine, explaining the other collaborations. According to Navarro and Queen in an 2004 interview on mun2 The Roof, the album was expected to feature a duet with Puerto Rican singer Don Omar. Spin saw Queen's collaboration with Fat Joe as a trend in reggaetón to have American rappers [...] "team up with its stars".|$|E
2500|$|At first, Eon FM played {{songs that}} [...] "would not be played elsewhere", having no {{playlist}} and avoiding Top 40 songs. Said Armstrong, [...] "we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be the beginning}} of a new era. It took us a while to realise we were wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In the High Street, {{round the}} corner. Crowds there; {{and here in}} our street only {{ourselves}} and a few men that hurried up after us. Mr. Audley shouted to them that we would get a ladder, but whether they could not hold on any more, or they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> quite away-- O Wilmet! I didn't see; but there was the most horrible thump and crash on the pavement.' ...|$|R

60|$|Now much disturbed, and dazzled with {{conflicting}} gleams of {{hope and}} dread, I looked at her for some explanation. But seeing how strongly she desired to remain quiet, and feeling {{that it was my}} own natural inclination too, at such a time, I did not attempt to break the silence. We proceeded without a word being spoken. Sometimes she glanced out of the window, as though she <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> slowly, though indeed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> fast; but otherwise remained exactly as at first.|$|R

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} avoided collision using evasive maneuvers {{once they}} were in visual proximity, and passed within about 135m of each other. An unidentified passenger told NHK, [...] "I {{have never seen a}} plane fly so close. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> crash." [...] Alex Turner, a passenger on Flight 907 and a student at Kadena High School, a school for children with parents stationed at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa Prefecture, estimated that the avoidance maneuver lasted for two seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Braun {{clarified}} that, in some ways, {{this was}} [...] "not the story" [...] came {{on to play}} {{but that it was}} in other ways. [...] "We were getting married, which is why I wanted to do the role," [...] she said. [...] "I thought {{that we were going to}} show what it’s like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated. There are a lot of story points and ideas I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hit upon, but they decided to take it another route." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{quietly for}} a time," [...] she said. [...] "It was you {{who were so}} terrified at the risk. Do you imagine that the danger is over?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dershowitz, in {{his book}} Taking the Stand, recounts that von Bülow had a dinner party after he {{was found not guilty}} at his trial. Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a [...] "victory party", and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for [...] "several {{interesting}} friends". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bulow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife's arm and said: [...] "Let's get out here. I think this guy is innocent. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{scheduled}} flight departed from Melbourne as planned at 22:30 using the [...] Runway 16. [...] {{before the end}} of the runway, travelling at a speed of , the captain ordered the first officer to rotate. [...] As the aircraft pitched upward it failed to leave the ground and the tail section struck and continued to scrape along the runway. The captain took over the controls and applied maximum thrust on all four engines by using the Take-off/Go-around (TOGA) detent. After exhausting the entire length of the runway, the aircraft failed to become airborne, and did not leave the ground until [...] beyond the end of the runway. The captain later said [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. It was that close".|$|E

He did nothing really for us, I {{think he just}} wanted to prop up his Fight tour of Australia. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> recording D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n at the time. His company said it was a bit heavy for them to do anything with. Although when it charted in Oz he was quick to take credit... Before he came to Oz he did press saying he couldn't wait to meet us. When we toured together he never even watched the band or talked to us. When he returned to the States he never contacted us again." ...|$|R

2500|$|In January 2006, Harry Belafonte led a {{delegation}} of activists, including Glover and activist/professor Cornel West, {{in a meeting with}} President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. [...] In 2006, Glover began working on a film about Toussaint Louverture, who led the 18th century revolt in Haiti. [...] It was reported that Chavez supported the film, [...] "hoping the historical epic will sprinkle Hollywood stardust on his effort to mobilise world public opinion against imperialism and western oppression." [...] In a 2015 interview, Glover said: [...] "The film that we always missed is a movie on the Haitian revolution and Toussaint Louverture...that was the movie that I wanted to do. We’ve developed a script. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get it done four years ago." [...] As of 2017, Toussaint had not been completed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cognitive {{science has}} been {{dominated}} by the computational conception that cogniton is computation across representations. To the extent to which cognition {{is supposed to be a}} purposive, meaningful, algorithmic, problem-solving activity, however, computers appear to be incapable of cognition. They are devices that can facilitate computations on the basis of semantic grounding relations as special kinds of signs. Even their algorithmic, problem-solving character arises from ther interpretation by human users. Strictly speaking, computers as such [...] apart from human users [...] are not only incapable of cognition but even incapable of computation, properly construed. If we want to understand the nature of <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have to study thinking, not computing, because they are not the same thing...|$|R

60|$|We went over--if I {{remember}} correctly--a stone fence. But I have {{no doubts}} of recollection {{about where we}} found ourselves. In the darkness I promptly fell over a grave-stone. The gay-cat sprawled over another. And then we got the chase of our lives through that graveyard. The ghosts must have <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> some. So did the train-crew, for when we emerged from the graveyard and plunged across a road into a dark wood, the shacks gave up the pursuit {{and went back to}} their train. A little later that night the gay-cat and I found ourselves at the well of a farmhouse. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> after a drink of water, but we noticed a small rope that ran down one side of the well. We hauled it up and found on the end of it a gallon-can of cream. And that is as near as I got to the quarries of Rutland, Vermont.|$|R
2500|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not serve}} overseas during World War II, primarily because it never reached full strength for an Airborne Infantry Battalion. [...] In reaction to the German counterattack that began the Battle of Bulge, the Airborne Command considered reorganizing the 555th PIB as a single reinforced Airborne Rifle Company, and sending it to Europe to reinforce the battered Airborne units already there. [...] However, before this could happen the crisis had passed, and the 555th PIB was instead alerted for deployment to the West Coast. [...] The men of the 555th PIB hoped that they would get into {{the war against the}} Japanese, but that was not their new mission. According to Sergeant Walter Morris, [...] "It was a secret mission called Operation Firefly. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> overseas to [...] MacArthur's theater." [...] It wasn't until they arrived in Oregon, in May 1945, that they learned they would be fighting the Japanese on the fire line in the Western United States.|$|R
