40|$|Are technocratic governments {{the reformers}} of last resort? And {{why are they}} appointed? Facing the ongoing European debt crisis, some {{countries}} choose to put technocrats into reform government offices, while others are able to reform their markets and fiscal structure within regularly elected governments. What differentiates these technocratic from non-technocratic governments in terms of origins and reform efforts? And are technocratic government compositions more able to implement complex market and fiscal reforms {{in a short period}} of time when facing difficult institutional settings? In order to answer these questions, this research follows an institutional approach along rational choice theory and the concept of varieties of capitalism.

Hitherto, there is still lack of biomechanical analysis on the execution of Kaedah A. Therefore, this study aims at analysing the effectiveness of Kaedah A based on the total execution time as well as to describe the kinematic characteristics of the hand movement upon its execution. The experiment was carried out by means of motion capture. Microsoft Kinect was utilised to detect the hand movement whilst the post processing of the captured motion was performed via Virtual Sensei Lite. Kaedah A was executed five times by an experienced Seni Silat Cekak Malaysia practitioner to investigate the accuracy and repeatability of the system. The data obtained serves as an input for the trajectory mapping for both initial and end point identification. The time difference, Δt between the points demonstrates that the total time execution for Kaedah A is less than 0. 1 s. Further analysis involves filtering the coordinate data obtained in order to generate the polynomial function of the hand movement during the execution of Kaedah A. It could be concluded that the Kaedah A execution has the features of a ballistic movement. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>provides</b> useful data for reliability prediction as well as further enhancement of the Kaedah A itself...|$|E
40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of long term {{disability}} and third leading cause of death (Curioni et al, 2009). Survival rates are increasing. Approximately 900, 000 people in England live with the effects of a stroke (NICE 2010). Health behaviour modification can be crucial in stroke rehabilitation and in avoiding long term impairment. Consultation with stakeholders identified increased numbers of patients experiencing long term weight gain following a stroke. This study aims to explore i) the existence of weight gain following a stroke ii) factors contributing to weight gain and iii) implications for the stroke rehabilitation pathway. A mixed method study incorporating i) a survey of South Yorkshire Health Cohort participants (n= 87); ii) interviews with staff (n= 18) and stroke patients (n= 10). Data were analysed using framework analysis methods. Across the care pathway inconsistencies exist in the recognition that weight gain is an issue for patients post stroke. The findings draw on components of the Theory of Integrated Care (Kodner & Spreeuwenberg, 2002). Applying the theory to <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>provides</b> a means to explain how patients may become lost across the different aspects of the stroke care pathway. Fragmented communication between health care professionals across the pathway limits opportunities to address the risks and realities of weight gain. Ambiguity arises for patients because weight gain following a stroke can be both a sign of progress and of a problem. Individualising care and integration of weight management advice across the whole pathway (acute, community and primary care settings) may prevent weight gain in stroke survivors. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} mid-level marketing managers' behaviour in product-market strategy implementation with the overall objective of understanding how the performance of product-market strategy implementation might be improved. A literature review {{from a number of}} fields is conducted in order to develop a guiding framework {{for the development of a}} conceptual model. By combining perspectives on product-market strategy implementation from a structural, contextual and interpersonal process perspective, the study provides a broad and integrative understanding of product-market strategy implementation performance. A holistic model encompassing situational antecedents to two dimensions of mid-level marketing managers' product-market strategy implementation behaviour (counterproductive work behaviour and citizenship behaviour) is presented. The outcomes of these dimensions of behaviour are assessed in terms of the internal and external effectiveness of product-market strategy implementation performance. A number of hypotheses are constructed linking situational antecedents to the dimensions of product-market strategy implementation behaviour and these dimensions of behaviour to product-market strategy implementation performance. The research design and empirical method used to test the hypotheses is developed and presented A questionnaire is designed and employed as the survey instrument to generate the data on the hypothesized relationships. The method of administration uses a four stage postal survey. The data generated are examined through an analysis of the descriptive statistics before scale construction through principal components analysis.

40|$|Abstract: Infrastructure {{development}} {{in many countries}} is considered {{as the most important}} factor which contributes to production growth by encouraging economic activities, productivity and improving the quality of life. Infrastructure is considered to have a positive and significant effect on productivity growth in all sectors of the economy. Infrastructure development is a means of promoting economic growth and it is essential for any country to investment in infrastructure that will leads to economic growth. Infrastructure is categorized in different category namely: physical infrastructure (which includes water system, electricity, roads and transport, etc.) and social infrastructure (which includes education and health facilities). In simple words infrastructure development aid to stimulates economic growth and create jobs for citizens. This is the indication that government must invest in infrastructure development and enjoy the benefits their investments will stimulates and also to maintain service delivery to the public. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the sources of infrastructure financing in South Africa. The study is conducted with reference to existing theoretical literature, published and unpublished researches in order to assess the sources of infrastructure financing in South Africa. Findings revealed that there are major sources of infrastructure financing which includes: tax revenues; lenders to government or enterprises (loans or guarantees); private investors (equity); development agencies (loans); donors (grants); tariffs and public-private partnerships. The study is conducted with reference to existing literature, unpublished and published research. Hence, this study assess the sources of infrastructure financing in South Africa and presented a robust background on the current sources of infrastructure financing. The findings of this study thus contribute to the body of knowledge on infrastructure financing and other available sources of infrastructure financing other than the use of taxation revenues to finance infrastructure. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>provides</b> a robust understanding of the need and importance of financing infrastructure...|$|E

The HImP {{is used as a}} vehicle through which partnership working and public participation is health planning in the ‘new NHS’ may be explained, The literature review discusses key theories and models of community participation, power and policy implementation which informed the development of my key research questions and strategy. A review of the global, national and local influences upon a community participation in health planning is supplemented with primary research {{in the form of a}} detailed case study of one locality’s response to the national requirement to involve the public in the development of their HImP. A multi-method case study was employed using the following methods of data collection: observation, interviews, questionnaires and documentary analysis. The research presented identifies a number of issues as significant in affecting a locality’s approach to public participation, including: power; the organisational cultures(s) within the HImP partnership; the attitudes and capacity of those charged with developing participatory activities; and the impact of national priorities on local flexibility to respond to community identified priorities. The application of Alford’s (1975) structural interests theory to <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>provides</b> a useful framework for assessing power relations and understanding why the HImP fails to represent community interests in the way that had been hoped. A number of recommendations are made to facilitate participation in health planning in the future, including: the need to address the national culture of risk avoidance; the need for better training in public participation skills for personnel charged with developing participatory opportunities; and the need for a mandatory performance framework related to community participation as a mechanism to ensure that participation issues are given the same attention as other nationally monitored issues.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} Latin American online purchase behaviour with a specific focus on the influence of perceived risk and trust. While studies of this nature have been conducted quite extensively in developed countries, their application in developing countries, such as Latin America is limited. Our study addresses this gap in the literature with an empirical study conducted in Chile. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop and test a proposed model of the influence of consumer’s perceptions of risk and trust on their attitudes and intentions to purchase on the Internet. An online survey method is used. The sample consists of 176 Chilean consumers who have made at least one purchase online. The data is analysed using structural equation modelling technique (SEM). Findings: The analysis revealed that of the perceived risk and trust factors examined, trust in third party assurances and a cultural environment of trust had the strongest positive influence on intentions to continuing purchasing online. Perceived risk had an inverse relationship with attitude and consumers’ attitude has a positive influence on intentions to purchase online. Trust in online vendors and a propensity to trust were both insignificant. Practical implications: Practically, these results identity which risk and trust beliefs towards purchasing online have the most effect thereby providing insights into how companies should seek to mitigate perceptions of risk to encourage new and return purchasers. Additionally, this research shows that consumers in a Latin American country, recognised as a collectivist, high risk avoidance culture, are willing to make purchases online despite the risks involved. Originality/value: The study and its results is one of few available that consider a Latin American context. The value of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>provides</b> insights into the specific risk and trust factors that influence Chilean consumers when considering purchasing online.
