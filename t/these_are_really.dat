Not only did he produce his Mécanique analytique, but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except {{for a short time}} when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important.|$|E
25|$|Jawless {{fish were}} the {{earliest}} fish to evolve. There is current {{debate over whether}} <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> fish at all. They have no jaw, no scales, no paired fins, and no bony skeleton. Their skin is smooth and soft to the touch, {{and they are very}} flexible. Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten onto other fish, and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host's skin into the viscera. Jawless fish inhabit both fresh and salt water environments. Some are anadromous, moving between both fresh and salt water habitats.|$|E

A pure cup, you {{remember}} it is; that much at least {71} you cannot but remember, of poppy-form among the cornfields; and it is best, in beginning, to think of every flower as essentially a cup.

You had better take the idea of a cup or vase, as the first, simplest, and most general form of true flower.|$|E
6000|$|American or Canadian college {{trustees}} {{would be}} horrified {{at the notion}} of professors who apparently do no work, give few or no lectures and draw their pay merely for existing.

To any young beginner I would recommend Petrus de Abano, as the most adequate and gruesome of the school, for [...] "real deevilry and pleesure," [...] while in the wilderness of Plotinus there are many beautiful passages and lofty speculations. Two winters in the Northern University, with the seamy side of school life left behind, among the kindest of professors--Mr. Sellar, Mr. Ferrier, Mr. Shairp--in the society of the warden, Mr. Rhoades, and of many dear old friends, are the happiest time in my life. This was true literary leisure, even if it was not too well employed, and the religio loci should be a liberal education in itself. We had debating societies--I hope I am now forgiven for an attack on the character of Sir William Wallace, latro quidam, as the chronicler calls him, [...] "a certain brigand." [...] But I am for ever writing about St. Andrews--writing inaccurately, too, the Scotch critics declare. [...] "Farewell," [...] we cried, [...] "dear city of youth and dream," [...] eternally dear and sacred.|$|E
6000|$|... (2.) After {{exploring}} the ground, {{the first thing}} to be done, as a preparation for reforming individual character, in school, is, to secure the personal attachment of the individuals to be reformed. This must not be attempted by professions and affected smiles, and still less by that sort of obsequiousness, common in such cases, which produces no effect but to make the bad boy suppose that his teacher is afraid of him; which, by the way, is, in fact, in such cases, usually true. Approach the pupil in a bold and manly, but frank and pleasant manner. Approach him as his superior, but still, as his friend; desirous to make him happy, not merely to obtain his good-will. And the best way to secure these appearances, is, just to secure the reality. Actually be the boy's friend. Really desire to make him happy;--happy, too, in his own way, not in yours. Feel that you are his superior, and that you must and will enforce obedience; but with this feel, that probably obedience will be rendered, without any contest. If <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> the feelings which reign within you, the boy will see it, and they will exert a strong influence over him, but you cannot counterfeit appearances.|$|E

6000|$|The Little Minister's jump {{is always}} spoken of as a brave {{act in the}} glen, but at such times I am silent. This is not because, being timid myself, I am without admiration for courage. My little maid says that three in every four of my poems are to the praise of prowess, and she has not {{forgotten}} how I carried her on my shoulder once to Tilliedrum to see a soldier who had won the Victoria Cross, and made her shake hands with him, though he was very drunk. Only last year one of my scholars declared to me that Nelson never said [...] "England expects every man this day to do his duty," [...] for which I thrashed the boy and {{sent him to the}} cooling- stone. But was it brave of Gavin to jump? I have heard some maintain that only misery made him so bold, and others that he jumped because it seemed a fine thing to risk his life for an enemy. But <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> charges of cowardice, and my boy was never a coward. Of the two kinds of courage, however, he did not then show the nobler. I am glad that he was ready for such an act, but he should have remembered Margaret and Babbie. As it was, he may be said to have forced them to jump with him. Not to attempt a gallant deed for which one has the impulse, may be braver than the doing of it.|$|E

Perhaps the best known 100 Class boats were the British Power Boat Company Type Two 63 ft HSL, {{also known as the}} 'Whaleback' after their distinctive design.|$|R
