5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
25|$|Unless <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> {{otherwise}} provided, {{the death}} of a party does not usually revoke the appointment of any arbitrator appointed by the deceased, and any agreement relating to the appointment is enforceable in the usual way against the personal representatives of the deceased.|$|E
50|$|In August 2011, {{there were}} claims {{made by the}} Speaker of the Bihar Legislative Assembly that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> merged with JD(U) as 2 of the 3 MLAs of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> joined JD(U). However <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> denied any such move.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 2800 {{members in}} 1906, by 1908 the figure {{had risen to}} 3600 and by 1910 it claimed a {{membership}} of 4206. At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 80 branches in 32 different localities. In 1911, after the merger with the Bukovina Bund, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 4500 members.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{two members}} in the Jordanian Parliament from 2003-2007. As of 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> <b>has</b> members in {{municipal}} councils throughout Jordan.|$|R
25|$|Within the United States, {{choice of}} law clauses are {{generally}} enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply. Within the European Union, even when <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> negotiated a {{choice of law}} clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the Rome I Regulation.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> {{not used}} express words, their {{intention}} may {{be inferred from}} the terms {{and nature of the}} contract, and from the general circumstances of the case. For example, a term granting the courts of a particular state exclusive jurisdiction over the contract would imply that the lex fori is to be the proper law (see forum selection clause).|$|E
25|$|Whether Europeans {{committed}} genocide {{against the}} Native peoples {{has been a}} controversial topic. Scholars disagree in their {{definition of the term}} in relation to the Beothuk, and <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> differing political agendas. While some scholars believe that the Beothuk died out due to the elements noted above, another theory is that Europeans conducted a sustained campaign of genocide against them.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> held several {{ordinary}} congresses throughout different cities, mostly focussing on provinces in south-eastern Turkey. So far, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had two nationwide extraordinary congresses, held in 2013 and 2014, where {{elections were}} held to select the chairpersons of <b>the</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> 1,100 members, {{according}} to party sources. Several local branches of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>have</b> been established, {{including one in}} London, created in May 2009.|$|R
50|$|From the {{establishment}} of Vort Arbeide in 1884, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> a growing and notable organisation of newspapers and other press outlets. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> press system eventually resulted in Norsk Arbeiderpresse (“Norwegian Labour Press”, now A-pressen). In January 1913 <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 24 newspapers, and 6 more newspapers were founded in 1913. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> periodical Det 20de Aarhundre. In 1920 <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> 33 newspapers and 6 semi-affiliated newspapers. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> its own publishing house, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag, succeeded by Tiden Norsk Forlag. In addition to books and pamphlets, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag published Maidagen (annual May Day publication), Arbeidets Jul (annual Christmas publication) and Arbeiderkalenderen (calendar).|$|R
25|$|In other jurisdictions, however, unless <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> {{expressly}} {{granted the}} arbitrators {{the right to}} decide such matters, the tribunal's powers may be limited to deciding whether a party is entitled to damages. It may not have the legal authority to order injunctive relief, issue a declaration, or rectify a contract, such powers being reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts.|$|E
25|$|While the King {{was trying}} to find a new way to hold {{negotiations}} between the parties involved, the negotiations themselves came to a standstill. <b>The</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> not spoken with each other since November 8, and the Francophone parties have stated that they would only rejoin the negotiating table if the Flemish parties apologize for the Chamber Committee on the Interior vote on Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{involved the}} same 308 electoral districts as in 2004, except in New Brunswick, where {{the boundary between}} Acadie—Bathurst and Miramichi was ruled to be illegal. Many of the candidates were also the same: fewer incumbents chose to leave than if they had served a full term, and <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> generally blocked challenges to sitting MPs {{for the duration of}} the minority government, although there had been some exceptions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{representation}} {{at local}} government level in England. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> limited representation on most councils {{on which it}} is represented, and was in minority control of Brighton and Hove City Council from 2011 to 2015. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> 4 or more councillors on the following local councils: Brighton & Hove, Bristol, York, Liverpool, Sheffield, Solihull, Lancaster, Mid Suffolk, Norwich and Oxford and Stroud.|$|R

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> {{reciprocally}} declared their concordant intent, either expressly or impliedly, {{a contract}} shall be constituted. If {{the parties agree}} on all the essential elements of the contract but have expressed no intent as to the non-essential elements, the contract shall be presumed to be constituted. In {{the absence of an}} agreement on the above-mentioned non-essential elements, the court shall decide them according {{to the nature of the}} affair. When one of the parties to a contract receives earnest money from the other, the contract is presumed to be constituted.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission {{has created}} a rule that puts some {{restrictions}} on asset managers when they make campaign contributions. The New York and Tennessee Republican parties {{filed a lawsuit against}} the SEC in August over the 2010 rule, arguing that it impedes free speech, seeking a preliminary injunction against the rule. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned whether <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> standing to bring the case, noting they failed to name the potential donors and did not cite any investment advisers who are upset about the rule.|$|E
25|$|In divorce cases, when a {{court is}} {{attempting}} to distribute marital property, if the divorcing couple is local and the property is local, then the court applies its domestic law lex fori. The case becomes more complicated if foreign elements are thrown into the mix, such as when the place of marriage {{is different from the}} territory where divorce was filed; when the parties' nationalities and residences do not match; when there is property in a foreign jurisdiction; or when <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> changed residence several times during the marriage.|$|E
500|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> first chairman, Frank Zeidler, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> around 500 members {{nationwide}} in 1975. <b>The</b> Socialist <b>Party</b> experienced substantial growth {{during the late}} 1970s and early to mid-1980s, expanding from only around 600 dues-paying members to around 1,700. In 2008, WMNF claimed that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> around 3,000 paying members. However, in 2010 a CommonDreams article suggested that the organization had only 1,000 members with party members claiming {{it to be an}} increase in the number of members. A New York Times article in May 2011 stated that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> [...] "about 1,000 members nationally". In February 2012, an article from The Root stated that <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "membership around 1,500".|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} {{supported a}} form of Quebec federalism that supports Quebec remaining within the Canadian federation while also supporting reforms that would allow Quebec substantial autonomy. While <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been described as centre-right {{in the context of}} Canadian politics, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> believes in a strong role for government in the economy and supports socially liberal policies. Also <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had a prominent social-democratic faction within it that was historically prominent in <b>the</b> <b>party</b> during <b>the</b> Quiet Revolution.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> been <b>the</b> South Carolina {{affiliate}} of <b>the</b> Natural Law <b>Party</b> but {{was taken over}} by <b>the</b> Green <b>Party</b> after <b>the</b> Natural Law <b>Party</b> officially disbanded its national organization in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been ballot qualified throughout its affiliation with <b>the</b> Green <b>Party.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Act also removes certain {{absolute}} {{rights of}} appeal (allowing parties to appeal {{regardless of the}} opinion of the High Court judge) from the High Court to the Court of Appeal. This was hotly debated, but the Master of the Rolls pointed out in Parliament that there is a significantly higher success rate in cases where the parties require the judge's permission to appeal than cases where <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> absolute rights of appeal, implying that the restriction of absolute rights of appeal should cut pointless cases out of the court system and speed up the process.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{fundamental}} mistakes, misrepresentations {{and similar}} defects {{may make a}} contract void ab initio, i.e. the defect is so serious that it prevents an agreement from ever coming into being. If this happens, every term in the contract including the express selection of the proper law, would be unenforceable. This {{raises the question of}} whether the lex fori should operate a policy of saving the validity of contracts wherever possible. Suppose that a contract would be valid under many potentially relevant laws but not under the putative proper law, and that, until problems arose, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> acted in good faith on the assumption that they will be bound by the agreement, some courts might be tempted to ignore the apparent proper law and choose another that would give effect to the parties general contractual intentions.|$|E
25|$|The DMK and {{its prime}} {{opposition}} party, the ADMK have posted {{an array of}} populist schemes targeting the human development index of the state. Most of the schemes are accused to be targeting garner larger electoral support. Both <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> schemes listed in the election manifestos covering various {{segments of the population}} involving fishermen, farmers and school children. Till the 2000s, the parties had welfare schemes like maternity assistance, subsidised public transport and educational grants. After the 2000s, the parties started competing at an increasing level over the distribution of consumer goods. The ADMK government distributed free cycles to class 11 and class 12 students during its tenure of 2001–06. The DMK, in competition, promised free colour televisions in its manifesto in 2006 elections. The competition continued during the 2011 elections when both parties announced free laptops for schools students and grinder, mixer and fans for public.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{its name}} since December 1997. It's the {{political}} unification of SDL (<b>Party</b> of <b>the</b> Democratic Left) and LB (Left Block) {{that took place}} in June 1997. In <b>the</b> beginning <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> name LB-SDL.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{adopted a}} One-China policy, arguing {{that there is}} only one state called China, and that the Republic of China (not the People's Republic of China) is its {{legitimate}} government. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> had conflicts with <b>the</b> Chinese Communist <b>Party.</b> Since 2008, however, in order to ease tensions with the People's Republic of China, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> endorsed <b>the</b> [...] "three nos" [...] policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou - no unification, no independence and no use of force.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>party's</b> {{election}} {{program for}} the 2001 parliamentary election stated that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> was a [...] "socialist party" [...] with {{a vision of a}} Norway without social injustice. Since its inception, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> promoted itself as socialist. In later years, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been portrayed as social democratic by some in the Norwegian media, and as democratic socialists. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been categorised as eco-socialist. The present leader, Audun Lysbakken, has been a self-proclaimed revolutionary, socialist, and Marxist. He believes <b>the</b> <b>party</b> to be a democratic socialist one.|$|R
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons {{to commit a crime}} at some time in the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, the Constitutional Court was {{scheduled}} to rule {{on whether or not}} to dissolve the PPP, Chart Thai, and Matchima Thippatai parties on electoral fraud charges. If the parties were dissolved, executives of the parties could have their political rights stripped for five years. However, non-executive MPs of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> the right to change parties {{for a period of time}} after the court decision. 37 PPP executives were also MPs, although 8 had resigned, leaving only 14. If the PPP was to be dissolved, the number of MPs they have would fall from 233 to 219. Out of Chart Thai's 43 executives, 19 of them are MPs. No Matchima executives are MPs. Thus, if the Constitutional Court dissolved all three parties, the government coalition would reduce in size to 283 out of a total of 447 MPs in Parliament – a majority is 224. The opposition Democrat Party has only 164 MPs. If all the non-PPP parties allied with the Democrats, they would have a total of 228 MPs – only 4 MPs above a majority.|$|E
500|$|As 15 U.S.C. § 1052 (d) indicates, a {{concurrent}} use registration {{may also be}} issued [...] "when a {{court of competent jurisdiction}} has finally determined that more than one person is entitled to use the same or similar marks in commerce." [...] As a matter of right, the TTAB will issue such a registration pursuant to a court order that an applicant has the right to use its mark in certain geographic area. Where a court has issued such an order, a {{concurrent use}} proceeding is not needed, as evidence has already been taken in the court proceeding, and the rights of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> already been determined.|$|E
50|$|By 1932, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> an {{estimated}} 3,000 members organized in around fifty <b>party</b> branches across <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> a predominately a male membership.
