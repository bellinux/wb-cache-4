In addition, the bolt may be fitted with a guardbolt, which is arranged to prevent the unwanted retraction of the latchbolt by an intruder; {{in this case the}} latchbolt is called a deadlocking latchbolt. There may be a provision on the inside handle to disable (lock) the outside handle from operating the latchbolt; this is referred to in the table below as the [...] "inside locking mechanism". This mechanism may consist of a push button or <b>turn</b> <b>button</b> in the inside handle.|$|E

50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, dead bolt, face plate, strike plate, escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, <b>turn</b> <b>button,</b> and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{introduction}} of two planes and the <b>turning</b> <b>button</b> were considered good ideas in theory, both features were heavily criticized by reviewers. Jeremy Dunham of IGN, Manny LaMancha of GamePro and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy felt it difficult to fight one-on-one when a player can start a cat-and-mouse game, while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin and Brian Gee of Game Revolution found the features to cause [...] "chaos". Turner said it deprived the player of the ability [...] "to have a normal Guilty Gear X2-style match", and Dunham said the computer reacted faster. David Smith of 1UP.com called it an [...] "irrational control scheme". The perceived poor execution of its new features led GameSpy {{to give it a}} special [...] "It Sounded Good on Paper" [...] award.|$|R

25|$|Amazon {{announced}} the Kindle Oasis (1st generation) on April 13, 2016, {{and it was}} released on April 27 worldwide. The Kindle Oasis is available in Wi-Fi ($290 ad-supported, $310 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($360 ad-supported, $380 no ads) models. The Oasis has a 6-inch, 300 ppi E Ink Carta HD display with ten LEDs. Its asymmetrical design features physical page <b>turn</b> <b>buttons</b> {{on one side and}} it has an accelerometer so the display can be rotated for one-hand operation with either hand. It has one thicker side that tapers to an edge that is 20% thinner than the Paperwhite. It includes a removable leather battery cover for device protection and increased battery life that is available in either black, walnut (brown) or merlot (red); the cover fits in the tapered edge. The Oasis has 28 hours of battery life if used with the battery cover with Wi-Fi off, however, without the cover, the Oasis battery lasts about seven hours. It has nearly 3GB of user storage. The Oasis includes the Bookerly (serif) font and it is the first Kindle to include the Amazon Ember (sans-serif) font.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1. AnyButton <b>turns</b> unmodified <b>buttons</b> on the {{clothing}} into op-portunistic mobile controls, by adding three motion sensors on the index fingernail, {{on the wrist}} and elbow. The user tunes up the music volume by pinching up and spinning the second button. This paper presents wearable opportunistic controls using un-modified clothing buttons. Buttons are commonly sewn on formal clothing and often came with multiple duplicates. In this paper, we <b>turn</b> passive <b>buttons</b> into dial widgets. Each button provides simple input modalities (e. g., tap and spin inputs). Multiple buttons allow for modeless and rich interac-tions. We present AnyButton, a wearable motion-sensor set, allowing for transferring buttons on clothing into mobile in-put on the move. Our prototype consists of three motion sen-sors attached on the index fingernail, the wrist, and the elbow. We interpret which button is under user interaction according to the wrist and elbow orientations, and how the button in the userâ€™s finger pinches being operated according to the motions on the fingertips. Each button allows for partial tap, discrete spin and dwell spin inputs. By distributing interface to the buttons, applications such as music players and call centers can use opportunistic clothing buttons as wearable controls...|$|R

5000|$|Pocket Gamer's Harry Slater {{gave the}} game a [...] "Bronze Award", stating, it [...] "isn't perfect, and some {{might find that}} it lacks a little depth, {{but this is a}} {{polished}} and instantly playable arcade racer with enough tracks and challenges to keep anyone with even a passing interest in vrooming little cars around a table entertained for a while." [...] Gamezebo's Joe Jasko praised the game's [...] "fun household environments. Beautiful graphics. Tons of replay value over multiple game modes." [...] However, he was unimpressed with the controls, which he felt were somewhat awkward, arguing that the sensors on the touchscreen for item activation and steering are too close together. Campbell Bird of 148Apps argued that [...] "Table Top Racing is a high quality package that delivers a satisfying and varied combat racing experience." [...] TouchArcade's Eric Ford argued that [...] "Table Tops environments and overall visual flair are pretty top notch. Unfortunately, a relatively generic gameplay outing and its emphasis on auto-acceleration controls keep the game from reaching loftier heights." [...] On the other hand, Pocket Lint's Mike Lowe argued [...] "The game's controls are wonderfully simple. There's no accelerator, instead your vehicle just goes and goes all by itself, much like a wind-up toy. All {{you need to do is}} tap the left or right <b>turn</b> <b>buttons</b> to the corresponding side of the screen, which means eyes can be fixed on to the action without fingers getting all in the way. None of this tilt-to-turn faff, although that is also an option within the menus if it's your personal preference." ...|$|R
