5000|$|Research on solvent-free Cordite RDB {{continued}} {{primarily on}} the addition of stabilizers, {{which led to the}} type commonly used in World War II as the main naval propellant. In Great Britain this was known as Cordite SC (= Solventless Cordite). Cordite SC was produced in different shapes and sizes, so the particular geometry of Cordite SC was indicated by the use of letters or numbers, or both, after the SC. For example, SC followed by a number was rod-shaped cord, with the number representing the diameter in thousandths of an inch. [...] "SC T" [...] followed by two sets of numbers indicated <b>tubular</b> <b>propellant,</b> with the numbers representing the two diameters in thousandths.|$|E
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{is normally}} {{operated by a}} crew of two, a loader and a gunner. The launcher is loaded by attaching a rocket container {{to the rear of}} the launcher. When the container is attached, the electrical firing circuit is connected. The rocket container is 626 millimetres long and weighs approximately 3.2 kilograms. On the left side of the launcher is the 3× APX M 309 optical sight, which is graduated between 100 and 1,000 metres. The launcher has a shoulder rest and forward pistol grip, both of which may be adjusted to suit the firer. The forward pistol grip contains a mechanical safety switch and the firing mechanism. When the safety is off, pulling the trigger generates a charge which fires the rocket.The watertight rear plug of the rocket container is removed just before firing, which closes the firing circuit and allows the rocket to be fired. The rocket is propelled by a large number of long sticks of <b>tubular</b> <b>propellant</b> that produce a constant pressure while burning, providing constant acceleration. The engine burns out before the rocket leaves the launcher at a velocity of approximately 300 metres per second. As soon as the rocket leaves the launcher, nine fins fold backwards from the rear. These fins provide stability for the rocket while it is in flight. There are two safeties. The first is a bore-riding pin located mid-body of the projectile that blocks the warhead firing circuit. After the projectile leaves the tube, the bore-riding pin falls out releasing the second safety which prevents detonation until the rocket has traveled at least 10 metres from the launcher. The rocket reaches a range of 330 metres in about 1.25 seconds, and 360 metres in 1.36 seconds.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that some {{conditions}} regarding the lower limit to the volume ratio of the two chambers dependent on the propellant property and the leakage parameter may exist in order that the pressure ratio is to be less than the critical pressure ratio in an H/L gun during burning. Also for progressive propellants constant pressure ratio may not exist for other than <b>tubular</b> <b>propellant...</b>|$|E
2500|$|Improved {{military}} rifle <b>propellants</b> are <b>tubular</b> nitrocellulose <b>propellants</b> {{evolved from}} World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition {{and sold to}} civilians for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting. [...] These propellants were DuPont modifications of United States artillery propellants. DuPont miniaturized the large artillery grains to form military rifle propellants suitable for use in small arms. These were improved {{during the first world}} war to be more efficient in rimless military cartridges replacing earlier rimmed rifle cartridges. Four-digit numbers identified experimental propellants, and a few successful varieties warranted extensive production by several manufacturers. Some were used almost exclusively for military contracts, or commercial ammunition production, but a few have been distributed for civilian use in handloading. Improved military rifle propellants are coated with dinitrotoluene (DNT) to slow initial burning and graphite to minimize static electricity during blending and loading. [...] They contain 0.6% diphenylamine as a stabilizer and 1% potassium sulfate to reduce muzzle flash.|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1911 the GP 11 cartridge featured some technical development. The projectile seating in the cartridge case neck was improved {{by adding a}} cannelure on the bullet and crimping the case neck over time, resulting in [...] (1911), [...] (1929 modification), [...] (1942 modification) extraction force. In 1942 the square flake shaped double-base propellant was replaced by <b>tubular</b> shaped double-base <b>propellant.</b> Further there were minor developments regarding the projectiles, sealing and primers. GP 11 cartridges were mass-produced for the Swiss military in the ammunition factories in Altdorf and in Thun until 1994. The last 1994 produced ammunition had Lot No. 349-94. Previously GP 11 was also produced Rotenburg and Solothurn as other municipalities in Switzerland.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interior}} ballistic propelling charge design using the optimization methods {{to select the}} optimum charge design and to improve the interior ballistic performance. The propelling charge consists of a mixture propellant of seven-perforated granular propellant and one-hole <b>tubular</b> <b>propellant.</b> The genetic algorithms and some other evolutionary algorithms have complex evolution operators such as crossover, mutation, encoding, and decoding. These evolution operators have a bad performance represented in convergence speed and accuracy of the solution. Hence, the particle swarm optimization technique is developed. It is carried out in conjunction with interior ballistic lumped-parameter model with the mixture propellant. This technique is applied to both single-objective and multiobjective problems. In the single-objective problem, the optimization results are compared with genetic algorithm and the experimental results. The particle swarm optimization introduces a better performance of solution quality and convergence speed. In the multiobjective problem, the feasible region provides a set of available choices to the charge’s designer. Hence, a linear analysis method is adopted to give an appropriate set of the weight coefficients for the objective functions. The results of particle swarm optimization improved the interior ballistic performance and provided a modern direction for interior ballistic propelling charge design of guided projectile...|$|E
