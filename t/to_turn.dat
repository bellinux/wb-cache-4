5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center}} of circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and began <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the northeast. Late on October29, a large burst of deep convection over the center of the storm allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) with a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg).|$|E
