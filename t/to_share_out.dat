2500|$|Conditions inside Snipe worsened in {{the midday}} heat {{as the number}} of {{casualties}} increased, with little more than shell-dressings and water to tend them. Just before noon, six Bren Gun Carriers were hit and caught fire; the heat and smoke drifting over the guns making the visibility even worse. Many of the gunners were among the casualties and guns were kept in action with improvised crews and by men moving from one to the other. Only thirteen guns were still operational to cover the [...] perimeter and the guns along the south-west face became so short of ammunition, that two men drove Jeeps back and forth <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>out</b> the remainder.

Eight Italian M13/40s, a self-propelled gun and infantry appeared over a ridge to the south-west, where only one 6-pounder was still in action.

50|$|Even {{when only}} money {{is to be}} divided and some fixed amount has been {{specified}} for each recipient, the problem can be complex.

50|$|Land had <b>to</b> be <b>shared</b> <b>out</b> {{at the new}} locations, {{and this}} was done by drawing lots. Farm lots were {{measured}} and pegged out. At Neu-Frauenberg, each one measured 4 × 4 Ruten, while at Sonnenberg they measured 10 × 4 Ruten, a Rute being the local version of the linear rood; a square Rute at that time ranged from 32 to 39 m². The new arrangement’s consequences were that they only slowly recovered and began growing, and poverty and hardship reigned for a long time. By 1816, there were 19 families living in Frauenberg.|$|R

In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, {{and sooner or later}} the load will have <b>to</b> be <b>shared</b> <b>out.</b> In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, in mid-August, key {{opposition}} candidates {{decided to}} unite behind Jean Ping {{in order to}} improve the opposition's chances of defeating Bongo, as holding the vote in a single round would presumably work heavily to Bongo's advantage as long as the opposition remained fragmented. Guy Nzouba Ndama, Casimir Oye Mba, Léon Paul Ngoulakia, and Aba'a Minko withdrew their candidacies to support Ping.

[...] However, in December 2010 his administration embarked on a [...] "sweeping reform" [...] of state subsidies in place {{since the beginning of the}} Islamic Republic.

50|$|An {{advantage}} of the system, {{at least from the}} point of view of politicians, was that it enabled different sections of a party or allied groups to work together in the same constituency. In the early and mid-19th century it was quite common for liberals in an area with two seats to support a left wing liberal Radical candidate and a right wing liberal Whig nominee. Similarly in the early 20th century the Liberal Party and Labour Party found it easier to split the seats in the remaining two member constituencies than <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>out</b> single member divisions.|$|E
40|$|International {{resources}} such as water are typically subject to conflicts as welfare monotonically increases with water. We consider a two-stage equilibrium model where {{it is possible for}} countries <b>to</b> <b>share</b> resource <b>out</b> of its self-interest. The first stage solves a trade model to determine economic equilibrium as a function of water allocation. The second stage utilizes the derived welfare functions to identify political equilibrium of a bargaining or game-theoretic problem. The results show that when trade is allowed, welfare functions can be non-monotone in some instances, implying that the level of conflict over water may be reduced or even alleviated...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} economists took {{a stand on}} the issue of the Target {{balances}} in a publication of the Ifo Institute, confirming Sinn's analysis. Financial commentator David Marsh, writing in early 2012, noted that TARGET2 provides [...] "automatic central bank funding for EMU countries suffering capital outflows provided through it" [...] and that the balances would [...] "have <b>to</b> be <b>shared</b> <b>out</b> by central banks throughout the Eurosystem ... if EMU fragments into its constituent parts. So the pressure on Germany is to keep the balances growing, in order to avoid crystallization of losses that would be hugely damaging not just to Berlin but also to central banks and governments in Paris and Rome".|$|R
5000|$|Some texts, like in philosophy, {{literature}} or scientific research, may appear {{more difficult to}} read because of the prior knowledge they assume, the tradition from which they come, or the tone, such as criticizing or parodizing. Philosopher Jacques Derrida, explained his opinion about complicated text: [...] "In order to unfold what is implicit in so many discourses, one would have each {{time to make a}} pedagogical outlay that is just not reasonable to expect from every book. Here the responsibility has <b>to</b> be <b>shared</b> <b>out,</b> mediated; the reading has to do its work and the work has to make its reader." [...] Other philosophers, however, believe that if you have something to say, {{you should be able to}} make the message readable to a wide audience.|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom of Ireland was a {{major source}} of concern and expense during his time in government. The Nine Years War there ended with the leader of the rebels Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone {{submitting}} to the Crown and being restored to his estates following the Treaty of Mellifont (1603). Four years later Tyrone led his followers into exile during the Flight of the Earls. The response of the government was to plan a Plantation of Ulster, <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>out</b> Tyrone's lands between the Gaelic Irish lords and settlers from Britain. In 1608 Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched O'Doherty's Rebellion by attacking and burning Derry. In the wake of O'Doherty's defeat at Kilmacrennan a much larger plantation was undertaken.|$|E

Culliford had sailed alongside the Charming Mary for a time, but had departed before May’s tenure as Captain. May was trying to repeat Every’s feat when English pirate hunters were reported en route.

40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} the multi-user synchronisation problem in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) -based systems for ad hoc environments is proposed and analysed.

Also a distributed version of the procedure is proposed in order <b>to</b> fairly <b>share</b> <b>out</b> the power consumption among all the devices. The proposed procedure makes use of higher layer capabilities in a cross-layer design and it does not incur too much complexity or power. This issue is specially critical in wireless heterogeneous ad hoc networks where devices can be very limited in terms of transmission and/or computational power. Publicad...|$|R
