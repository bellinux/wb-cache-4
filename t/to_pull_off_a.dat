Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience.

At the January 1983 convention in Winnipeg, 33.1% supported a review. The fact that Clark had been able to increase his support among party members by only 0.4% was likely a contributing factor to his decision to resign as leader and seek a renewed mandate from the membership through a leadership convention.

25|$|With Liverpool down to ten men, Manchester United {{were now}} {{able to control the}} tempo of the game as they wished. The Red Devils pushed forward in search of a second goal, and Liverpool {{continued}} to weather the storm, but, with 10 minutes to go, United finally found the goal they were looking for. Nani, just on as a substitute, took a corner from the left hand side, which Cristiano Ronaldo headed in from seven yards; his first goal against Liverpool. Then, two minutes later, Nani combined well with Wayne Rooney, playing a one-two with the striker, before firing the ball home from 20yards to make the final score 3–0. The win put United six points ahead of Arsenal with seven games left to play, and meant the Gunners had to win their match against Chelsea later that afternoon. Chelsea, however, came from behind <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 victory. This propelled Chelsea into second place, five points behind Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, the Old Etonians {{entered the}} FA Cup {{for the first}} time. They started their {{campaign}} against the Swifts, which proved a very tough match.

Following a win against Maidenhead, they played Shropshire Wanderers; in an extremely close match, the Old Boys came through by a single goal to nil. Thus, the Old Boys reached the FA Cup Final at their first attempt, where they came up against a strong team from the Royal Engineers {{who were in the}} final {{for the third time in}} the first four years of the competition. The final was played in a strong wind, which favoured the Old Etonians who had the wind at their backs for all but ten minutes of the 90, and all 30 minutes of extra time (teams in this period only changed ends after a goal was scored). The teams finished level after 90 minutes, with a goal from Capt Henry Renny-Tailyour being cancelled out by one from Alexander Bonsor.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh's {{scores were}} worse {{the second time}} around, as Nafees {{failed to live up}} to his {{previous}} innings century after making 33, and opener Omar edged to the wicket keeper Gilchrist for 18. Soon the captain was run out for seven and Aftab Ahmed lost his wicket in the final over to see Bangladesh positioned at 124 for 5 at stumps. The fourth day continued in the same vain as Khaled Mashud was bowled for a duck in the second over of the day and both Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie made up for their first innings oversight by bowling and trapping the last five wickets of Bangladeshi for 88 runs, the former improving his previous 0-112 to this innings' 3-28, despite Mohammad Rafique taking three fours off him. Australia started the final innings in the knowledge that they have only twice, in fifty years, managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> second innings score higher than the first, needing as they did 307 runs for victory. Taking no risks, Australia's openers made a calm 67 either side of the tea break before captain Ricky Ponting came out with seven boundaries and an unbeaten 72 at the close of play. The second wicket partnership stood for 106 before Australian wickets began to tumble with two removals from left-arm slow bowler Mohammad Rafique to leave the team at 212-4, with only their high-scoring skipper and Adam Gilchrist (6*) in the way of their five bowlers at the lower order.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 14 {{to begin a}} four-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kuroda struggled with his control in the opener as the Dodgers lost 9–5. Jon Garland made his first {{start of the season}} the next day, but he was wild and the Dodgers were pounded 11–2. Clayton Kershaw had his first poor outing of the season in game 3 of the series, as the Dodgers lost 9–2 to extend their losing streak to five games. The Dodgers snapped that streak the following day as Billingsley pitched eight shut out innings, while striking out eleven. Matt Kemp hit a walk-off two run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth for the 2–1 win. The Dodgers then began a four-game homestand with the Atlanta Braves. Prior to the first game, the Dodgers called up their 2010 minor league player of the year, Jerry Sands, who doubled in his first at-bat and later picked up his first RBI to back solid pitching from Ted Lilly in the Dodgers 2–1 win. Brandon Beachy outpitched Kuroda in the next game, as the Braves broke open a tight game with an eight run ninth inning <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> 10–1 rout. Jon Garland bounced back from his rough debut to pick up the complete game victory, as Andre Ethier had three hits including a home run and Juan Uribe had four RBI in the Dodgers 6–1 victory. Matt Kemp hit a two-run walk off home run in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat the Braves 5–3 to end the series.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{started the}} 2002–03 season well, winning 14 {{of their first}} 16 games, and had {{the best record in}} the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most {{versatile}} players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.|$|E

[...] Howze concluded that the show was definitely a [...] "couples concert" [...] meant to be [...] "enjoy" [...] with a love partner. CityBeats Jac Kern, who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that intimate moments between the couple on stage were [...] "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, [...] "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band. With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, you do not need much more." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the concert being a collaborative tour, [...] "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, [...] "If there's anything to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." [...] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses [...] "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" [...] on stage.

His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given {{a clear view of}} what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E
