Also, a line by Ariel in Act IV brings other scholars to ask questions as to whether the original actor for Ariel played the part for Ceres as well, due to a shortage of boy actors.|$|E

In Arrazola, one of the community’s specialty is the carving of complex animal bodies, especially iguanas out of one single piece of wood. Another way the community competes is through its annual festival “Cuna de los Alebrijes” (Cradle of the Alebrijes), which is held each year to promote its figures. This fair is cosponsored by the Secretary of Tourism for the state of Oaxaca. It occurs {{in the second half of}} December, during the Christmas season, with more than sixty artisans who make the figures.

500|$|Rather than teach {{small parts}} {{of a large number}} of subjects, Whitehead {{advocated}} teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.

If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>connections</b> between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs.

[...] Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material, the content produced by contemporary artists had diminished in quality. Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements.
