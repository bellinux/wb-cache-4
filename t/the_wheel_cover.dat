50|$|Locomotives with a Buchli drive also {{typically}} have an asymmetrical appearance: on one side, the bearings {{of the drive}} wheels are visible, on the other side, they are almost completely covered by <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> box of the gear wheels.|$|E
50|$|Also new, (for 1978 only), were {{slightly}} revised standard Luxury wheel covers, with fewer ribs along the outside diameter of a slightly more-convex/bulging brushed center portion of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> This wheel cover style would then only appear {{one more time}} - on the downsized 1980 Lincoln Continental and Town Car and Town Coupé models.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variant of}} <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> known also as wheel shrouds or rim blanking, is that {{commonly}} associated with the German wheelmaking brand BBS since the 1970s. These are attached onto the wheel first, then bolted on as if the driver or mechanic is bolting the wheel to his car {{in the manner of}} changing their wheel. Commonly made from aluminum, they are designed to distribute airflow to the brakes, thereby generating downforce depending on the shape. Thus, these wheel covers are functional rather than merely decorative.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{centrifugal}} pump {{is the common}} mechanical equipment, which is extensively applied in the water conservancy, ships and other projects, and the blade structure {{is a very important}} part in the {{centrifugal pump}}. In this paper, the stress distribution and concentration of single blade in the impeller are analyzed under the different pressure field of the blade structure surface, and the fatigue failure of blade is also studied. The research results show that the we can get the stress and strain of the blade accurately and intuitively through the analysis for the blade structure, the stress concentration of the centrifugal pump blade is mainly in the root and junction of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> and the import value of stress concentration is larger than the outlet; the stress concentration may be caused easily as the stress increases rapidly in the blade, which has a great impact on the fatigue strength, the fatigue limit of the blade with the stress concentration is decreased more obviously than the fatigue limit of the smooth blade...|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S., {{during the}} age of custom cars (1950s-early 1960s), decorating one car with <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> from another was common. Two very {{desirable}} <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were those of the 1950 Cadillac (called the [...] "Sombrero") {{and that of the}} 1953 to 1955 Oldsmobile, which resembled a huge, three-tined spinner. Aftermarket suppliers included the [...] "Mooneyes" [...] brand (named after the firm's founder Dean Moon) hubcaps and <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> that were some of the first independently offered for hot rods and custom cars.|$|R

50|$|Another type of <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>the</b> static <b>wheel</b> fairing, was {{introduced}} by BBS for Ferrari at the British Grand Prix {{to act as a}} brake cooling aid for front wheels whilst remaining stationary <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself with one part being cut out at a 27° angle to enable hot air to escape and thus became adopted by every team. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were banned from use in F1 from 2010 after incidents where they broke loose in races. To get around the ban, Ferrari used a detachable integral aero device made from the same magnesium material as <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, which consisted of double concentric rings of different diameter. As parts of cars how have to be homologated, its rivals were unable to copy this device. Its use became eliminated when the FIA revised the regulations for 2011 to prohibit wheel materials in certain exclusion zones.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} landing gear-equipped biplane {{featured a}} two-seat open cockpit and a four-passenger enclosed cabin. The fuselage is constructed with welded steel tubing with fabric covering. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> were <b>covered</b> with large streamlined wheel pants.|$|R
50|$|Little chrome {{was used}} {{compared}} to other vehicles of the time, and the only two-tone paint combinations offered were limited to roofs being contrasted with bodies. The car had power steering, power brakes, power windows, power seats, power vent windows, and a tachometer. The vanes on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> were individually bolted inside {{the frame of the}} cover. It sported a high greenhouse and a wraparound windscreen. Fueling was accomplished via a swingaway left taillight. The Continental Mark II had only one option, air conditioning, for $595. Cars with A/C had different body parts.|$|R
40|$|Six {{versions}} of <b>the</b> wire mesh <b>wheel</b> were laboratory {{tested in a}} lunar soil simulant, consisting of a crushed basalt with a grainsize distribution {{similar to that of}} samples collected during Apollo 11 and 12 flights, to determine their relative performance. The consistency of the soil was varied to cover a range of cohesive and frictional properties to simulate soil conditions assumed to exist on the moon. Programmed-slip and constant-slip tests conducted with <b>the</b> single <b>wheel</b> dynamometer system showed that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>covered</b> with a metal chevron tread over 50 percent of its contact surface was slightly superior to that of other tread designs...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} and handling of automobile are significantly affected by its aerodynamic properties. One {{of the main}} causes of aerodynamic is about drag force and lifting force. This will influence all the aspect of the vehicles such as overall performance, fuel consumption, safety and stability. However, the unavoidable need for wheels caused and even recently causes significant problems for aerodynamicists {{to deal with the}} flow. The addition of wheelhouses and rotating wheels to an aerodynamically optimized car body, leads to decrease in drag and lift coefficients by 30 % and 40 %, respectively. In an aerodynamic field, the main important thing to get the stability, {{performance and}} good fuel consumption is to design a vehicle with low CD. The reduction of lift and flow separation is the key results that will be a point of discussion. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> will reduce <b>the</b> flow separation at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> houses that causing the turbulent airflow. The wake region also will be reduced and this will make the drag force that produce at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> houses will reduced. By the lower drag force will contribute to the lower fuel consumption. The task was done by doing a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis for expected vehicle speed of 40 - 140 km/h. A drag force was found based on inputs from CFD analysis. This force was calculated to produce the drag coefficient of the model as a whole. The approach needed to justify the amount of drag that can be reduced by addition of a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> as compared to the model without <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> This project is to get an overall comparison of the velocity and pressure distribution before and after <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> is added. <b>The</b> drag coefficient of the vehicle was decreases from 0. 3882 to 0. 3773 when adding <b>the</b> rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cover...</b>|$|R

One of the few options was a canvas sliding roof, and the vehicle was installed with bench seats for both front and rear passengers, with the gearshift installed on the dashboard.|$|R
5000|$|Cord and Hudson {{were the}} early adopters.

This {{configuration}} differs from the [...] "knock-off" [...] spinners found on some racing cars and cars equipped with true wire <b>wheels.</b> While <b>the</b> knock-off spinner resembles an early hubcap, its threads also retain <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, in lieu of lug nuts.|$|R
