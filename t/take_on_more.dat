5|$|Their {{marriage}} is loving {{and the birth}} of their first child helps heal the breach between Victoria and her mother, who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis. Nevertheless, Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>more</b> duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household.|$|E

25|$|Broken Walrus I {{was made}} of mild steel, a {{material}} which corrodes {{at a faster rate}} than other forms of steel such as cast iron or stainless steel. Mild steel is commonly used because of its cost, ease of use, strength, and ability to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>more</b> deformation without failing. It also corrodes more quickly in outdoor environments, especially moist atmospheres, and causes increased loss of metal due to rusting the longer it is exposed. Broken Walrus I was displayed outdoors for nearly thirty years, through cycles of harsh, midwestern winters and humid summers, causing the structure to become increasingly corroded until it was more efficient to remove the sculpture rather than repair it.|$|E
25|$|While caregiving by males {{appears to}} be altruistic, {{particularly}} in cotton-top sires, the costs of infant care {{may in fact be}} tolerated for selfish reasons. Namely, the costs to male weight and foraging ability may in turn promote consecutive pregnancies in dominant females, thereby providing more offspring bearing the sire's genes. Additionally, the cooperative breeding structure of cotton-tops can change with group size and parental experience. First-time sires spend a greater amount of time carrying the infant than experienced ones, and in smaller groups, sires do a greater proportion of carrying and feeding the infant than in larger groups, where helpers <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>more</b> of the work. Total care for infants remains constant with varying group size, and infant outcome is not significantly different in groups that have differing levels of experience in raising offspring.|$|E

25|$|On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge {{issued a}} {{temporary}} injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while {{the situation was}} sorted out.

The injunction was overturned {{late in the evening}} on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed.

25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step up and <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>more</b> responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga {{by virtue}} of the {{establishment}} of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>more</b> coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalgas first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the radio masts snapped from the weight of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and steam hoses. The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the shelter of the bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.|$|E
