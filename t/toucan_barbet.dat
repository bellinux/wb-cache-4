50|$|The Semnornis barbets {{are fairly}} large barbets, {{measuring}} between 18 and 21 cm. The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> {{is larger than}} the prong-billed barbet and considerably heavier. They possess large, swollen bills and lack strong sexual dimorphism in their plumage. The plumage of the prong-billed barbet is orange-brown, and that of the <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> is more distinctively patterned with black, red, grey and gold.|$|E
50|$|<b>Toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> {{calls are}} unmistakable, {{composed}} of loud shrieks that travel long distances. It is usually sung in duet by the breeding pair, simultaneously or in syncope by both sexes during the breeding season, usually for territorial display. The frequency of calls change with each season, being more common {{at the beginning}} of the year and declining in frequency after April. The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> can also produce clicking sounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> is from February through to October. Pairs may have two or even three broods per year.|$|E

50|$|The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> forages for 12 {{hours of}} the day around its territory, {{foraging}} from ground level to 30 m up into the canopy.

50|$|During a BOU financed {{expedition}} in 1973 and 1974 {{she spent}} on the Mascarenes where she made the first complete voice recording study of all endemic land birds including the Réunion harrier, the echo parakeet, the Mauritius kestrel, the Mauritius pink pigeon, the Mascarene swiftlet, and the Mascarene swallow. In 1974 she teamed up with Colin Groves in the Tana River floodplain where they studied the endangered Tana River red colobus and the Tana River mangabey. In 1978 she married ornithologist Lester L. Short. As research associate and later senior research fellow in the National Museums of Kenya {{she and her husband}} took part in an ornithological project which lasted from 1985 to 1999. They studied the behaviour of the honeyguides on the Ol Ari Nyiro estate in Laikipia, Kenya and compiled an ornithological list of all birds recorded on the Ol Ari Nyiro estate. She was also among the team who rediscovered the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker for a short time in 1986/87. Jennifer Horne was a member of BirdLife International. Together with Lester L. Short she wrote the chapter of the <b>toucans,</b> <b>barbets</b> and honeyguides in the Handbook of the Birds of the World (Volume 7) and the book <b>Toucans,</b> <b>Barbets</b> and Honeyguides: Ramphastidae, Capitonidae and Indicatoridae.|$|R
50|$|Ramphastides is an infraorder of the Piciformes order, that {{includes}} <b>toucans</b> and <b>barbets.</b> Formerly the barbets have been classified {{in a single}} family, Capitonidae. However, this {{has turned out to}} be paraphyletic with regard to toucans which resulted Capitonidae being split up into several families.|$|R
500|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes. Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, <b>barbets,</b> <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be {{closely related to the}} woodpecker family (woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (woodpeckers, <b>barbets,</b> <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.|$|R
50|$|The toucan-barbets are {{the small}} bird genus Semnornis. This was often {{included}} in the paraphyletic barbets but recently usually considered a distinct family Semnornithidae; alternatively, all barbets might be moved to the toucan family Ramphastidae as a subfamily, Semnornithinae. It contains only two species, the <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> (S. ramphastinus) and the prong-billed barbet (S. frantzii).|$|E
50|$|The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> roosts and nests inside {{cavities}} {{and holes}} in tree trunks that it carves out with its powerful beak. The incubation period lasts 15 days, and the hatchlings fledge after 45 days. Juveniles look {{very much like}} adults, but have paler colors and a black iris. Juveniles' plumage is kept {{for at least two}} months after fledging.|$|E
50|$|It {{often has}} been placed with the other barbets in the Capitonidae. However, DNA studies have {{confirmed}} that this arrangement is paraphyletic; New World barbets are {{more closely related to}} toucans than they are to Old World barbets. As a result, the barbet lineages are considered distinct families; the prong-billed barbet and the <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> now form a separate family, Semnornithidae.|$|E
50|$|Asian barbets {{are usually}} birds {{of the inner}} forest. One species, the {{coppersmith}} barbet, is adapted to life on the forest edge and in scrub. They are mainly solitary birds, eating insects and fruit. Figs of the genus Ficus {{are the most important}} fruit taken by Asian barbets. Large fig trees will attract several species of barbet along with other frugivores. In addition to figs numerous other species of fruiting tree and bush are visited; an individual barbet may feed on as many as 60 different species in its range. They will also visit plantations and take cultivated fruit and vegetables. Fruit is eaten whole and indigestible material such as seed pits regurgitated later (often before singing). Regurgitation does not usually happen in the nest (as happens with <b>toucans).</b> <b>Barbets</b> are thought to be important agents in seed dispersal in tropical forests.|$|R
50|$|Barraband {{was born}} to Jacques Barraband and Marie-Anne Bebit in 1767 (or 1768) and was baptized on August 31, 1768 at the church of Sainte-Croix in Aubusson. His father worked in the local {{tapestry}} factory and the son too worked there briefly after studying art at the local school which was famed for producing several artists of note including Francis Roby de Faureix and Etienne de La Seiglière de La Cour. He later moved to Paris, working at tapestry and carpet stores on rue de la Huchette and studying art at l’Academie royale de peinture under Joseph-Laurent Malaine. During the French exposition of 1798, he produced some paintings for the carpet manufacturers Gobelins and Savonnerie and for the porcelain makers Dihl and Gerhard. He also made illustrations of insects for the French naturalist Sonnini and illustrated a book by Fournier on Egypt. He then produced a series of watercolours of birds and flowers between 1801 and 1804 by direct commission of Napoleon Bonaparte. Among his most famous works are those he made to illustrate François Le Vaillant's scientific studies on parrots (perroquets), birds of paradise (oiseaux de paradis), rollers (rolliers), <b>toucans</b> (<b>toucans),</b> <b>barbets</b> (barbus), sugarbirds (promerops), bee-eaters (guêpiers), trogons (couroucous), and turacos (touracos). One of his students was Pauline Rifer de Courcelles who later married the artist Joseph August Knip. Pauline de Courcelles illustrated the birds in Histoire Naturelle de Tangaras, des Manakins et des Todiers by Anselme-Gaetan Desmarest (1805).|$|R
5000|$|Pici {{is one of}} the two suborders of {{the order}} Piciformes and {{includes}} two infraorders Ramphastides (<b>toucans</b> and <b>barbets)</b> and Picides (honeyguides and woodpeckers). Members of this suborder are often called [...] "true piciforms" [...] as it was thought the jacamars of Galbulidae and puffbirds of Bucconidae (of the other piciform suborder Galbuli) not closely related to toucans and woodpeckers, but instead to the order Coraciiformes. However, analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group {{to the rest of the}} Piciformes, also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in Piciformes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> {{is usually}} found in pairs or small groups perched silently on long {{horizontal}} branches, making them {{hard to find}} unless active or singing. It is a territorial bird that usually lives in small groups of 3-6 individuals. In the absence of interference these groups can occupy a certain territory {{for a year or}} longer. The flight is characterized by being hurried and noisy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} the species was grouped with the other barbets in the Capitonidae family. However, DNA studies have {{confirmed}} that this arrangement is paraphyletic; the New World barbets are {{more closely related to}} the toucans than they are to the Old World barbets. As a result, the barbet lineages are now considered to be distinct families, and the <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet,</b> together with the prong-billed barbet, is now placed into the separate family Semnornithidae.|$|E
50|$|The Semnornis toucan-barbets {{are found}} in the Neotropics. The prong-billed barbet is {{restricted}} to the humid highland forests of Costa Rica and Panama. The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> is found in similar habitats in the western montane forests of Ecuador and Colombia. In addition to primary forest they may occupy forest edges and secondary growth. Neither species is migratory, and young birds do not appear to disperse very far after fledging; young toucan barbets only disperse 0.5 km.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{understood}} that the mode of nesting has influenced the colour, not that the colour has determined the mode of nesting; and this, I believe, has been generally, though not perhaps universally, the case. For we know that colour varies more rapidly, and can be more easily modified and fixed by selection, than any other character; whereas habits, especially when connected with structure, and when they pervade a whole group, are much more persistent {{and more difficult to}} change, as shown by the habit of the dog turning round two or three times before lying down, believed to be that of the wild ancestral form which thus smoothed down the herbage so as to form a comfortable bed. We see, too, that the general mode of nesting is characteristic of whole families differing widely in size, form, and colours. Thus, all the kingfishers and their allies in every part of the world nest in holes, usually in banks, but sometimes in trees. The motmots and the puff-birds (Bucconidae) build in similar places; while the <b>toucans,</b> <b>barbets,</b> trogons, woodpeckers, and parrots all make their nests in hollow trees. This habit, pervading all the members of extensive families, must therefore be extremely ancient, more especially as it evidently depends in some degree on the structure of the birds, the bills, and especially the feet, of all these groups being unfitted for the construction of woven arboreal nests.[123] But in all these families the colour varies greatly from species to species, being constant only in the one character of the similarity of the sexes, or, at all events, in their being equally conspicuous even though differently coloured.|$|R
5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being <b>barbets,</b> <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|R
50|$|The diet {{of these}} two species {{is made up of}} fruits and insects. The ratio of the two is more similar to the <b>toucans</b> than other <b>barbets</b> and is {{dominated}} by fruits. A 1993 study of the stomach contents {{of these two}} species found only fruit. Fruits may be eaten whole, held in the foot and broken and eaten, or crushed and only the juices eaten. Insects are more common in the diet of nestlings, and compose 40% of the food brought to the nest in toucan-barbets. Toucan-barbets may also feed their chicks small numbers of vertebrates. They have also been recorded eating flowers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> {{is unusual}} among frugivorous birds {{in that it}} breeds cooperatively, with several helpers aiding the {{dominant}} breeding pair with incubation and raising the young. Groups are larger outside the reproductive season but generally shrink to three individuals in season, usually composed of previous immature offspring that stay with their parents and help with the new hatchlings. After the breeding season, the group increases due to greater acceptance of non-family members. These helpers significantly increase the reproductive success of the breeding pair.|$|E
50|$|The Bellavista Reserve {{is home to}} a huge {{variety of}} bird species. Hummingbirds are seen {{particularly}} often in and around the reserve, with sighted species including the lesser violetear, buff-tailed coronet, sparkling violetear, gorgeted sunangel, Andean emerald, purple-bibbed whitetip, speckled hummingbird, white-booted racket-tail, violet-tailed sylph and purple-throated woodstar. Species such as the tanager-finch, giant antpitta, swallow-tailed nightjar, plush-capped finch, beautiful jay, and white-faced nunbird are also seen, as well as the plate-billed mountain-toucan and <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet.</b> The Andean cock-of-the-rock is also frequently spotted at the nearby lek, where the males and females gather to breed.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} territorial, with territories range between 4.0 and 10.6 ha, {{with an average}} of 5.8 ha. Most of the {{territory}} will consist of mature forest, although the species can adapt to live in forests with small areas of secondary forest or pastures. <b>Toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> groups show a marked territorial behavior towards other groups or species, which is usually made clear by the loud duets of breeding pairs. The territory is actively protected by the breeding pair by chasing of intruders; the helpers assist in this, especially near the nest.|$|E
40|$|The Picidae (woodpeckers, wrynecks and piculets) {{comprise}} a family within the near passerine order Piciformes. Creationists have often {{appealed to the}} unique anatomical and behavioural specializations found in woodpeckers as evidence of divine design. However, until now no baraminological studies of the group have been undertaken. This paper reports a baraminic distance correlation analysis of 50 morphological characters (mostly related to hind limb musculature) and 20 taxa (12 picids and eight outgroup taxa). The {{results show that the}} woodpeckers, wrynecks and piculets form a well-defined group united by significant positive correlation and separated from seven of the eight outgroup taxa (<b>barbets,</b> <b>toucans</b> and toucanets) by significant negative correlation. The eighth outgroup taxon, the honeyguide Indicator, was neither positively nor negatively correlated with the other taxa in the dataset. Multidimensional scaling applied to the baraminic distances revealed an orthogonal pattern with ingroup taxa arranged on one axis and outgroup taxa on another, a result that has previously been interpreted as mitigating conclusions of negative discontinuity. However, repeating the analysis without the genus Indicator, which formed one of the axes, did not change the negative correlation between the picids and non-picids, suggesting that the result cannot be dismissed merely as an artefact of the multidimensional scaling pattern. The results suggest that all members of the Picidae constitute a single holobaramin. This conclusion is consistent with hybridization dat...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>toucan</b> <b>barbet</b> is a {{medium-sized}} robust barbet, of 19 to(-) 21 cm long and weighing 80-115 g. The beak is robust {{with a yellow}} maxilla and a light green mandible, both with dark ends. The plumage is colourful and includes a black crown, [...] "mask" [...] and thin cervical collar. There are long occipital feathers and a conspicuous white stripe behind the eye, which has a bright red-colored iris. The {{nape of the neck}} is golden-brown and becomes yellow towards the rump. The throat, upper breast and sides of the nape are grayish-blue. The lower breast and middle belly are bright red, while the lower belly is yellowish green. The wings and tail are grey. There is little sexual dimorphism; both sexes are almost identical except for the female being slightly less bright, and the female lacks the tuft on the black plumage of the nape. Immature birds are duller than adults, and don't develop prongs until they are four months old.|$|E
