25|$|WFAA was {{the first}} station {{to break the news}} of President John F. Kennedy's {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963, which occurred about two blocks north of the station's studios near Dealey Plaza, outside the Texas School Book Depository (now known as the Dallas County Administration Building), and seriously injured then-Governor John Connally, who was riding in the motorcade carrying Kennedy. The station conducted the first live television interview with Abraham Zapruder, who shot the famous film of the assassination. During the course of <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Zapruder, who came to the Communications Center studio by police escort, WFAA announcer and program director, Jay Watson (who reported on the shooting with Jerry Haynes, both of whom heard the gunshots being fired at Kennedy), intimated that the film was to be developed in the station's film lab; however, WFAA did not possess the ability to process the Kodachrome II 8mm safety film from Zapruder's camera. WFAA and its live remote unit fed much of the coverage of the assassination and its aftermath to ABC over the next four days. The shooting of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, however, was not broadcast live (as it was on NBC) or on tape (as on CBS one minute later) by WFAA and ABC as the former's live newsgathering truck was positioned elsewhere at the time. ABC was therefore only able to show delayed newsreel footage of the historic event. WFAA had purchased a fully equipped, live broadcast studio truck prior to the assassination of Kennedy, but the truck was not rolled out for the parade through downtown Dallas. In the aftermath of the murder, the staff was told the cost would have been too great for the news department to compensate the production facility for its use.|$|E

During the editing of Not My Life, Bilheimer cut <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Tutu, but later re-added a single quotation.

[...] Tutu, head of the truth and reconciliation commission, surprised Bilheimer with his response, saying that [...] "these people have committed monstrous acts," [...] but that, according to Christianity, traffickers can still be redeemed and become saints.|$|E

In 2005, in <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that was on the verge of being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in <b>the</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work.
