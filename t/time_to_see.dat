5|$|However, a Portia takes a {{relatively}} long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> objects, possibly because {{getting a good}} image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs and mantises, which a Portia often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter.

He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E

Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither were seriously damaged.

5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
