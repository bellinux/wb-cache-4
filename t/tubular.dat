5|$|Model 1200 Hunting: 28-inch barrel with a {{built-in}} choke and a five-shell <b>tubular</b> magazine.|$|E
5|$|Model 1300 Defender: Increased {{capacity}} {{variants of}} the Model 1300 with a seven-shell <b>tubular</b> magazine.|$|E
5|$|The flowerpeckers {{are very}} small, stout, often brightly {{coloured}} birds, with short tails, short thick curved bills and <b>tubular</b> tongues.|$|E
5|$|Adephaga {{contains}} about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes ground beetles (Carabidae), water beetles (Dytiscidae) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae). In these insects, the testes are <b>tubular</b> {{and the first}} abdominal sternum (a plate of the exoskeleton) is divided by the hind coxae (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, <b>tubular</b> steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered <b>tubular</b> steel furniture.|$|E
5|$|Almost all large wind {{turbines}} {{have the same}} design— a {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} having an upwind rotor with three blades, attached to a nacelle on top of a tall <b>tubular</b> tower.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored {{arc welding}} (FCAW) – almost {{identical}} to MIG welding except it uses a special <b>tubular</b> wire filled with flux; {{it can be used}} with or without shielding gas, depending on the filler.|$|E
5|$|Kidneys: renal <b>tubular</b> {{acidosis}} (Type 2), {{a disorder}} of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of {{essential amino acids}} needed for protein synthesis).|$|E
5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a <b>tubular</b> outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a <b>tubular</b> structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E
5|$|<b>Tubular</b> veins {{run through}} the two-layered {{membranous}} wing. Veins {{are connected to the}} haemocoel and in theory allow haemolymph to flow through them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through the veins.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its <b>tubular</b> shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal <b>tubular</b> flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|Artillery in the Middle Ages {{primarily}} {{consisted of}} {{the introduction of the}} cannon, large <b>tubular</b> firearms designed to fire a heavy projectile over a long distance. Guns, bombs, rockets and cannons were first invented in China during the Han Chinese Song Dynasty and then later spread to Europe and the Middle East during the period.|$|E
5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} {{the designs of}} a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced with steel in order to comply with fire regulations, though the <b>tubular</b> structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a <b>tubular</b> entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Harrison overdubbed call-and-response guitar riffs by Alvin Lee and Ron Wood {{onto the}} 1973 rhythm track, {{as well as}} his own slide guitars. Further overdubs {{included}} baritone and tenor saxophone parts by Tom Scott, and a second acoustic guitar, played by Mick Jones. Harrison also contributed on organ, clavinet and percussion, the last of which included <b>tubular</b> bells (or chimes), sleigh bells and zither.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta (formerly Endymion non-scriptus or Scilla non-scripta) is a bulbous {{perennial}} plant, {{found in}} Atlantic areas from north-western Spain to the British Isles, and also frequently {{used as a}} garden plant. It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland {{to refer to the}} harebell, Campanula rotundifolia. In spring, H.non-scripta produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 <b>tubular,</b> sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves.|$|E
5|$|In adults, kidney {{involvement}} progresses to end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced kidney disease. Proteinuria, hypertension at presentation, and pathology features (crescentic changes, interstitial fibrosis and <b>tubular</b> atrophy) predicted progression. About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal <b>tubular</b> function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared {{from the}} body by <b>tubular</b> {{secretion}} and excreted unchanged in the urine; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics).|$|E
5|$|Most of the genre's major bands {{released}} {{their most}} critically acclaimed albums {{during the years}} 1971–1976. The genre experienced {{a high degree of}} commercial success during the early 1970s. Jethro Tull, ELP, Yes and Pink Floyd combined for four albums that reached number one in the US charts, and sixteen of their albums reached the top ten. Mike Oldfield's <b>Tubular</b> Bells (1973), an excerpt of which was used as the theme for the film The Exorcist, sold 16 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by <b>tubular</b> secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|The Queen {{declared}} the competition officially open, immediately {{followed by a}} trumpet fanfare based on a theme from <b>Tubular</b> Bells by Mike Oldfield and then a fireworks display. The 2012 ceremony {{was the second time}} the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in her capacity as Queen of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two <b>tubular</b> struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} Schlumbergera have adaptations for {{pollination}} by hummingbirds: <b>tubular</b> flowers with abundant nectar, and colours towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum. Most species require cross-pollination to set seed. The exceptions are S. kautskyi and S. microsphaerica; as noted above, the latter is found at higher altitudes where humming birds may be absent or less common.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Bridge {{was built}} as a one-track <b>tubular</b> bridge which opened in 1860. It was the first bridge to cross the St. Lawrence River, and the longest bridge in the world. It was re{{built as a}} two-track truss bridge in 1898. The South Y {{approach}} was rebuilt around the Saint-Lambert locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1961.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tubular</b> Bells (Mike Oldfield) Telecast <b>Tubular</b> Bells Part One and <b>Tubular</b> Bells Part Two. Recorded at BBC Broadcasting House November 1973 and {{aired in}} early '74 and June '74. Available on Oldfield's Elements DVD.|$|E
25|$|Corolla yellow, 4-5.5cm long, <b>tubular</b> to infundibuliform, base of corolla {{narrowly}} <b>tubular.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late 1974, his {{follow-up}} LP, Hergest Ridge, was No.1 in the UK {{for three}} weeks before being dethroned by <b>Tubular</b> Bells. Although Hergest Ridge was released over a year after <b>Tubular</b> Bells, it reached No.1 first. <b>Tubular</b> Bells spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.2 before its one week at the top. Like <b>Tubular</b> Bells, Hergest Ridge is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's Herefordshire country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering world music piece Ommadawn released {{after the death of}} his mother Maureen.|$|E
25|$|Type 4 RTA is not {{actually}} a <b>tubular</b> disorder at all {{nor does it}} have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal <b>tubular</b> acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal <b>tubular</b> ammonium excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which is secondary to hypoaldosteronism, and results in a decrease in urine buffering capacity. Its cardinal feature is hyperkalemia, and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or <b>tubular</b> hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Membranous zone – {{contains}} membranes {{derived from}} megakaryocytic smooth endoplasmic reticulum organized into a dense <b>tubular</b> system {{which is responsible}} for thromboxane A2 synthesis. This dense <b>tubular</b> system is connected to the surface platelet membrane to aid thromboxane A2 release.|$|E
25|$|Suction piles {{are used}} {{underwater}} to secure floating platforms. <b>Tubular</b> piles are {{driven into the}} seabed (or more commonly dropped a few metres into a soft seabed) and then a pump sucks water out {{at the top of}} the <b>tubular,</b> pulling the pile further down.|$|E
25|$|Tuned percussion, {{consisting}} of pitched instruments such as glockenspiel and <b>tubular</b> bells.|$|E
25|$|Corolla: Greenish {{yellow or}} creamy white, <b>tubular,</b> four-lobed; lobes imbricate in bud.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Oldfield {{produced}} the third <b>Tubular</b> Bells album (also premiered at a concert, {{this time in}} Horse Guards Parade, London), drawing on the dance music scene at his then new home {{on the island of}} Ibiza. This album was inspired by themes from <b>Tubular</b> Bells, but differed in lacking a clear two-part layout.|$|E
