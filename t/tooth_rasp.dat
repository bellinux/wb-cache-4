40|$|The {{thorough}} investigation of both grain threshing and grain separating processes {{is a crucial}} consideration for effective structural design and variable optimization of the tangential flow threshing cylinder and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder composite units (TLFC unit) of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, spike <b>tooth,</b> <b>rasp</b> bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit. The results of this research can be used to successfully design the TLFC unit of small and medium-sized (SME) combine harvesters. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: to {{investigate}} classification and possible causes of dulaa disorders and effect of surgical removal on male sexual desire. Animals: Twenty six male camels (age= 6 - 13 years) with dulaa injuries were {{admitted to the}} Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. Sixteen camels showed signs of protruding, fluctuating and edematous dulaas. Other ten camels showed signs of completely entrapped dulaas. Procedures: Under deep sedation and local infiltration anesthesia, injured dulaa was surgically amputated. Entrapped dulaa was gently pulled out before performing surgery. Results: Amputated protruded dulaa had ulcers, edema and hematoma. Entrapped dulaa had ulcers, impaction with food, fibrosis and penetrating wounds. None of the operated males showed reducing sexual desire 4 weeks after the operation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: It was concluded that injured dulaa was either protruded or entrapped. Sharpness of canine teeth {{may play a role}} of having dulaa injury in camels, so it is recommended to perform <b>teeth</b> <b>rasping</b> annually just before the reproductive season. Amputation of dulaa had no effect on male sexual desire in dromedary camels...|$|R
2500|$|Basic {{floating}} can {{be accomplished}} by the practitioner pulling the end of horse's tongue out the side of the mouth, having an assistant hold the tongue while the <b>teeth</b> are <b>rasped.</b> [...] The horse will not bite its own tongue, and will often tolerate the floating process if held closely and kept in a confined area where it cannot move. [...] When complex dental work is required or if a horse strenuously objects to the procedure, sedation is used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of types of drum, clearances (CR) and drum speeds on performance of jobâ€™s tears shelling unit. The types of drum were peg <b>tooth</b> and <b>rasp</b> bar with an open shelling drum. Clearances of 10, 15 and 20 mm were tested with the drum speeds of 350, 400, 450 and 500 rpm. The results found that the rasp bar drum with 10 mm of clearance and 400 rpm of drum speed were suitable condition for shelling with capacity of 12. 98 kg/h and efficiency of 99. 76 % which provided 71. 65 % of whole and small damage kernels (% FK + % KQ) ...|$|R
40|$|Limpet {{teeth are}} {{an example of}} a {{biological}} short fiber reinforced composite material used for a mechanical function. The local micro-scale elastic properties of limpet teeth were examined by bending FIB fabricated beams of the limpet tooth material using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The elastic modulus values for the limpet tooth material varied from 140 GPa at the tooth posterior edge, through 90 GPa at the tooth core to 120 GPa at the tooth anterior edge. This variation in the elastic modulus of limpet tooth material at the posterior, interior and core regions of the tooth is indicative of a mechanically graded structure and is expected to enhance the durability of limpet <b>teeth</b> during <b>rasping</b> over rock surfaces during feeding...|$|R
25|$|Adults {{commonly}} feed on {{the blood}} of mammals. They are able to reopen wounds that are almost completely healed. Mouthpart morphology in the genus ranges from sponging mouthparts to mouths with <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth.</b> Many species have enlarged prestomal teeth. The metathoracic spiracle is covered in long, thick setae. The average male Hydrotaea is 6.5-8.5mm and the average female is 5.75-7.5mm.

50|$|This caecilian is viviparous. Fertilisation is {{internal}} {{and up to}} 16 developing larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs for three months. Then, they develop <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth</b> and feed on maternal glandular secretions, scraping {{the inside of the}} oviduct to stimulate their production. When they emerge, after 11 months of gestation, they are 10 to 15 cm long. They then shed their larval teeth and rapidly grow a set of adult ones.|$|R

5000|$|The genus Panaque {{contains}} {{a small number}} of small to medium-sized South American suckermouth armoured catfishes that are notable for being among the very few vertebrates that feed extensively on wood. [...] In addition, algae and aufwuchs {{are an important part of}} the diet, and they use their <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth</b> to scrape this from rocks.

50|$|Reproduction {{usually takes}} place in the spring in small brooks and streams. The adults {{afterwards}} die. The larvae are called ammocoetes and at first develop among the sand and gravel on the bed of the stream. They feed on detritus, insect larvae and small crustaceans that they filter out of the sediment. They undergo metamorphosis when about four years old. As adults, they feed on living or dead fish, gripping them with their small <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth</b> and swallowing smaller food items whole.|$|R
25|$|In most of {{the more}} ancient {{lineages}} of gastropods, the radula is used to graze by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates. Limpets scrape algae from rocks using radula equipped with exceptionally hard <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth.</b> These teeth have the strongest known tensile strength of any biological material, outperforming spider silk. The mineral protein of the limpet teeth can withstand a tensile stress of 4.9 GPa, compared to 4 GPa of spider silk and 0.5 GPa of human teeth.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, David B. Weishampel {{proposed}} a new hypothesis on how hadrosaurids fed. His {{study of the}} sutures between bones in fossil skulls concluded that ornithopods, a group of bird-hipped dinosaurs that includes hadrosaurids, had flexible upper jaws and that when the lower jaw clamped shut, pressure would spread outward {{from both sides of}} the upper jaw. The upper teeth would grind against the lower <b>teeth</b> like <b>rasps,</b> trapping the plants and grinding them up. The theory remained largely unproven until the study by Purnell, Williams and Barrett, which Science magazine called, [...] "The strongest independent evidence yet for this unique jaw motion". However, in 2008, a group of American and Canadian researchers, led by vertebrate paleobiologist Natalia Rybczynski, replicated Weishampel's proposed chewing motion using a computerized three-dimensional animation model. Rybczynski et al. believe Weishampel's model may not be viable, and plan to test other hypotheses.|$|R
50|$|At {{breeding}} time, a {{male and}} female Cayenne caecilian twine around {{each other and the}} male places a spermatophore in the female's cloaca. Fertilisation is internal and the Cayenne caecilian is viviparous. Six to 14 young with gills develop inside the female's oviduct. At first, they feed on the yolks of their eggs, but they develop <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth</b> and later consume glandular secretions produced by the lining of the oviduct. Birth takes place after about eight months and the juvenile caecilians shed their temporary teeth and develop their adult dentition.|$|R
60|$|It {{was happy}} for Uncas and the scout, and even David, {{that they were}} all beyond the reach of his arm at such a moment; for, assuredly, no {{refinement}} in cruelty would then have deferred their deaths, in opposition to the promptings of the fierce temper that nearly choked him. Meeting everywhere faces that he knew as friends, the savage grated his <b>teeth</b> together like <b>rasps</b> of iron, and swallowed his passion for want of a victim on whom to vent it. This exhibition of anger was noted by all present; and, from an apprehension of exasperating a temper that was already chafed nearly to madness, several minutes were suffered to pass before another word was uttered. When, however, suitable time had elapsed, the oldest of the party spoke.|$|R
5000|$|After {{selecting}} a male, the female deposits eggs in his territory. During the mating grasp, or amplexus, the male rides {{on top of}} the female, grasping her just behind her fore limbs. The female chooses a site in shallow water among vegetation, and lays a batch of up to 20,000 eggs, and the male simultaneously releases sperm, resulting in external fertilization. The eggs form a thin, floating sheet which may cover an area of 0.5 to 1 m2. The embryos develop best at water temperatures between [...] and hatch in three to five days. If the water temperature rises above , developmental abnormalities occur, and if it falls below , normal development ceases. Newly hatched tadpoles show a preference for living in shallow water on fine gravel bottoms. This may reflect a lesser number of predators in these locations. As they grow, they tend to move into deeper water. The tadpoles initially have three pairs of external gills and several rows of labial teeth. They pump water through their gills by movements of the floor of their mouths, trapping bacteria, single-celled algae, protozoans, pollen grains, and other small particles on mucus in a filtration organ in their pharanges. As they grow, they begin to ingest larger particles and use their <b>teeth</b> for <b>rasping.</b> They have downward-facing mouths, deep bodies, and tails with broad dorsal and ve ntral fins.|$|R
5000|$|Originally it {{was known}} from only one specimen, but 189 new finds in the years {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. (...) As a result, Odontogriphus has become prominent in the debate that has gone on since 1990 about the evolutionary origins of molluscs, annelid worms and brachiopods. A group of scientists think that Odontogriphusâ€™s feeding apparatus, which is [...] "nearly identical" [...] to Wiwaxiaâ€™s, is an early version of the molluscan radula, a chitinous [...] "tongue" [...] that bears multiple rows of <b>rasping</b> <b>teeth.</b> Hence they classify Odontogriphus and Wiwaxia as close to the ancestors of the first true molluscs. One scientist has presented a different analysis, arguing since 1990 that Wiwaxia is not closely related to molluscs but is much more like a polychaete worm. He argues that the supposed [...] "radula" [...] is nothing of the sort; he classifies Odontogriphus as a basal lophotrochozoan, in other words close to the last common ancestor of molluscs, annelid worms and brachiopods.|$|R

40|$|Chitons (Mollusca) are marine {{invertebrates}} that produce radulae (<b>teeth</b> or <b>rasping</b> tongues) containing {{high concentrations of}} biomineralized magnetite and other iron-bearing minerals. As Fe isotope signatures are influenced by redox processes and biological fractionation, Fe isotopes in chiton radulae {{might be expected to}} provide an effective tracer of ambient oceanic conditions and biogeochemical cycling. Here, in a pilot study to measure Fe isotopes in {{marine invertebrates}}, we examine Fe isotopes in modern marine chiton radulae collected from different locations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to assess the range of isotopic values, and to test whether or not the isotopic signatures reflect seawater values. Values of Î´ 56 Fe (relative to IRMM- 014) in chiton teeth range from âˆ’ 1. 90 to 0. 00 â€° (Â± 0. 05 â€° (2 Ïƒ) uncertainty in Î´ 56 Fe), probably reflecting a combination of geographical control and biological fractionation processes. Comparison with published local surface seawater Fe isotope data shows a consistent negative offset of chiton teeth Fe isotope compositions relative to seawater. Strikingly, two different species from the same locality in the North Pacific (Puget Sound, Washington, USA) have distinct isotopic signatures. Tonicella lineata, which feeds on red algae in the sublittoral zone, has a mean Î´ 56 Fe of âˆ’ 0. 65 Â± 0. 26 â€° (2 Ïƒ, 3 specimens), while Mopalia muscosa, which feeds on both green and red algae in the eulittoral zone, shows lighter isotopic values with a mean Î´ 56 Fe of âˆ’ 1. 47 Â± 0. 98 â€° (2 Ïƒ, 5 specimens). Three possible pathways are proposed to account for the different isotopic signatures: (i) physiologically controlled processes within the chitons that lead to species-dependent fractionation; (ii) diet-controlled variability due to different Fe isotope fractionation in the red and green algal food sources; and (iii) environmentally controlled fractionation that causes variation in the isotopic signatures of bioavailable Fe in the different tidal regions. Our preliminary results suggest that while chitons are not simple recorders of the ambient seawater Fe isotopic signature, Fe isotopes provide valuable information concerning Fe biogeochemical cycling in near-shore environments, and may potentially be used to probe sources of Fe recorded in different organisms...|$|R
