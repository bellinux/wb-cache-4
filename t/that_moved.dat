Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, {{and set up the}} cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything <b>that</b> <b>moved.</b>|$|E

However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Charley {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> off {{the west coast of}} Africa in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August9 while located roughly 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daniel {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July12, it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15mph (25km/h), and on July16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands near an associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July16. At the time, it was located about 525miles (845km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. Tracking westward at a low latitude, the system fluctuated in organization, with the development and weakening of deep convection and weak outflow for several days. By September18, the disturbance entered a region where there was sinking air, an inhibiting factor of tropical cyclone development. Two days later, the system separated from the ITCZ and quickly developed into a tropical depression, the twelfth of the season, while located about 605miles (975kilometers) southeast of Barbados.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> {{off the coast of}} Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly after, the system became embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high pressure {{to the north of}} the depression led to a general westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>moved</b> across the Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29.

One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E
