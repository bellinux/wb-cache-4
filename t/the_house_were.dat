5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his first}} term, Rosas was {{generally}} credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives.

A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution.

5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the 2nd Marquis of Annandale left Craigiehall to his nephew, Charles Hope-Weir (1710–1791), {{second son}} of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun.

A walled forecourt and the formal gardens in front of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> removed. He also planted numerous trees across the estate, laid out avenues, and had several garden buildings constructed. A lake was excavated, and a new bridge over the River Almond was constructed to link the neighbouring estate of Lennie, which Hope-Weir had bought in 1750.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly overgrown with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E

5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Trident {{contains}} peristyle panels {{with the}} motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme suggests that the owners of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> somehow connected to maritime pursuits.

They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics that appear in Roman Italy some decades later.|$|E

5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the 19th century, parts of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} for officers of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>were</b> held on 27 and 28 October 1999, while those for peers elected by party were held on 3 and 4 November; {{the results were}} proclaimed to the House on 29 October and 5 November. Voters were required to rank in order of preference, on a ballot prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments, as many candidates as there were places to be filled. The candidates receiving {{the greatest number of}} votes (without regard to the ranking on the ballots, so in effect block voting) were declared elected. Only if there were ties would the ranking be examined. Thereafter, until November 2002, if a vacancy occurred, the next-highest vote-getter (the rankings being examined, again, only in the case of ties) in the original election would fill the seat. This procedure was used on two occasions.|$|E
