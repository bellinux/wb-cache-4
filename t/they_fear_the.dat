The Government seldom permits private construction of Shi’a mosques. Virtually all existing mosques in al-Ahsa {{were unable to}} obtain licenses and faced the threat of closure {{at any time and}} {{in other parts of the}} country were not allowed to build Shia-specific mosques.|$|E

The Mall Rats take {{advantage}} of their new position of power and try to instate peace in the city. Danni joins them and tries to set up a Bill of Rights in an effort to unite all the tribes. Lex and Alice, Tai-San's new bodyguard, supervise the security of the trading market that is installed in the mall. Jack and Ellie work together on finding more information about the origins of the virus and create a newssheet for the city, called The Amulet. When the Mall Rats discover they don't need the antidote any more, <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> city will descend into chaos again.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six basic body shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, broad shoulders and skinny. With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the Highway Code, therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E
500|$|The winner now {{controls}} {{three separate}} hands, each staked with one card. A new deck of 52 cards {{that has been}} shuffled and cut is used. Cards are drawn for the contestant, {{one at a time}} and the contestant then chooses a hand in which to place each card. The contestant can use a power chip to dispose of an unwanted card. [...] The contestant can end the round at any time if <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> next card will cause them to bust on any of the three hands. However, using a power chip forces the contestant to place the next card in a hand or use another chip if one is available; the contestant can only end the round after scoring a 21 in a hand. Getting 21 in one hand wins $1,000; in two hands wins $5,000; and if 21 is scored on all three hands, the contestant wins the grand prize of $25,000. If the contestant busts on any hand, they will lose all money earned in the bonus round, but retain the $1,000 (and bonus prize, if applicable) from the main game won earlier. On some episodes in season two, the top prize was increased to $50,000 with the other payouts remaining the same.|$|E
500|$|Lobengula {{was alarmed}} by how some were perceiving his {{dealings}} with Grobler, and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners. Despite his familiarity with Moffat, the king did not consider him above suspicion, and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general, [...] "they may like us better, but <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> Boers more". Moffat's negotiations with the king and izinDuna were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836. He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case. On 11 February 1888, Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal {{at the foot of}} the agreement. The document proclaimed that the Matabele and British were now at peace, that Lobengula would not enter any kind of diplomatic correspondence with any country apart from Britain, and that the king would not [...] "sell, alienate or cede" [...] any part of Matabeleland or Mashonaland to anybody.|$|E

2500|$|Voluntary altruistic {{organizations}} often motivate {{their members}} by encouraging deep-seated personal beliefs, whether religious or other (such as social justice or environmentalism) that are taken [...] "on faith" [...] more than proved by rational argument. [...] When individuals resist temptations to free riding (e.g., stealing) because they hold these beliefs (or because <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> disapproval {{of others who}} do), they provide others with public goods that might be difficult or impossible to [...] "produce" [...] by administrative coercion alone.|$|E
2500|$|Groups {{supporting}} individual {{gun ownership}} praised Ashcroft's support through DOJ for the Second Amendment. He said specifically, [...] "the Second Amendment protects an individual's {{right to keep}} and bear arms," [...] expressing the position that the second amendment expresses a right. NRA president Sandra Froman said, [...] "When these Bush Administration officials affirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, the enemies of freedom were outraged because <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> Second Amendment for what it really is– a shield against oppression." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dent also {{denied the}} {{rationality}} and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers {{that this is}} the character of Theseus from Greek mythology, a creation himself of [...] "antique fable". Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He can't tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.|$|E
50|$|United States Navy Commander Jim Bradley {{is sent to}} Japan to test a new {{chemical}} that will desalinate water.

Despite their objections, the villagers are evacuated and the experiment goes on as scheduled. As <b>they</b> <b>feared,</b> <b>the</b> chemical reawakens their god, a giant prehistoric monster. The creature destroys the local village and then heads {{to the city of}} Oneida.|$|R

2500|$|Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and {{biologist}} Stuart Newman {{accept that}} biotechnology {{has the power}} to make profound changes in organismal identity. They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> blurring of the boundary between human and artifact. Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in modernization in which technology has been used to transform the [...] "natural" [...] into the [...] "artefactual". In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of [...] "monsters" [...] such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic. The film Blade Runner (1982) and the novels The Boys From Brazil (1976) and The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people as well as subhumans. Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as dehumanizing possibilities from ever happening, usually {{in the form of an}} international ban on human genetic engineering.|$|E
