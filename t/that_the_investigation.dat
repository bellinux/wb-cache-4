5|$|On 6 February 2006, on ABC's Good Morning America, Van der Sloot's parents {{stated that}} {{their son was}} unfairly singled out and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> left them devastated. Later that month, while Van der Sloot and his father were in New York City for an {{interview}} with ABC's Primetime, they were served with a lawsuit filed by Natalee's parents, Beth and Dave Holloway, alleging personal injury; the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds that August.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2011, Georgia Tech {{was forced}} to vacate the win due to an NCAA investigation. The NCAA accused Tech of fielding an ineligible player during the game, and {{although}} {{they were unable to}} obtain evidence that an ineligible player had been played, the NCAA concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> had been hampered by Georgia Tech's administration. This was taken as evidence of wrongdoing, and penalties for playing an ineligible player were imposed.|$|E
5|$|Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen {{traveled}} to Barentsburg on 30 August {{to inform the}} communities about the accident, and distributed ample written information in Russian about the then-known details about the crash. Later in the day, a Russian aircraft arrived with Deputy Minister Aleksandr Petrovich of the Ministry of Emergency Situations along {{with a team of}} 11 rescue workers, and representatives from the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the Embassy of Ukraine in Moscow, the Federal Air Transport Agency and Vnukovo Airlines. In a meeting that evening, the Governor accepted Russia assistance, while it was confirmed by international agreement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> would be led by the authorities in the country where the accident occurred, Norway. On 31 August, Minister of Justice Grete Faremo visited the Russian settlements as a representative from the Government of Norway.|$|E

50|$|Houghton left Australia in mid-1980 (around {{the same}} time as Michael Jon Hand), {{accompanied}} by Clines, returning in October 1981 when it appeared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> were unlikely to legally endanger him.|$|R
5|$|On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown {{announced}} that fourteen statements had been collected and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was progressing. In October 2013, {{a group of}} men set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT hate crime. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. As of May 2014, however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E

5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
