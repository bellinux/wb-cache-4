5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E

5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at the controls of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E

25|$|The large flat wooden {{ceiling in}} the Church of St Michael, Hildesheim of c. 1200 has {{the space to}} include a complex {{iconographic}} scheme based around the tree, which encompasses Adam and Eve, the Prophets and the Four Evangelists. Panel paintings are rare, but a German example of c. 1470 (Darmstadt) shows a Tree {{on the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triptych. A large Polish baroque oil by Michael Willmann (1678, Kościół Wniebowzięcia NMP, Krzeszów) shows a typically crowded Baroque apotheosis scene, with thin tendrils lacing round the figures, but not supporting them.|$|E
25|$|The regiment's {{coat of arms}} {{included}} a yellow shield divided by a diagonal red stripe with the shield of the New York National Guard's 51st Machine Gun Squadron in the canton. <b>The</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> windmill were depicted in red in the lower left below the stripe, while a red star was located in the upper right above the stripe. The star represented the regiment's initial organization in Texas, the stripe symbolized its conversion to artillery, and the canton represented the regiment's initial composition, as {{more than half of}} its personnel in the interwar period were ex-members of the 51st Machine Gun Squadron. The Organized Reserve's Minuteman crest was located above the shield.|$|E
25|$|The panels include {{paintings}} of the Virgin Mary and the Infant Christ; Saint Peter; several canons (recognizable by their fur hats); several priests praying or preaching; a demon with {{the tail of a}} serpent; angels playing instruments; a fallen angel with <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bat; a centaur; a mermaid; a dragon; an elephant; a tiger; an ostrich; domestic animals, such as horses, dogs and pigs; and common wild animals, such as wolves and deer. People from ordinary medieval life are also portrayed; a butcher, a knight, a juggler, a young woman performing her toilet, and both a man and woman answering the call of nature. All together the panels portray {{the history of the world}} and ordinary life as known and imagined in the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Intended {{to perform}} {{better in the}} mountainous terrain of the Austrian alps, the Type C {{featured}} a longer fuselage, greater wingspan, and strengthened undercarriage. The Type B's Austro-Daimler engine was exchanged for a Heiro with slightly less power but also much lighter. The extended wingspan soon led to problems, however, when the prototype's wings collapsed under stress testing. A second prototype, with strengthened wings, was accepted by the Army in August 1913, and placed an order for another 24 aircraft. Soon after deliveries began, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Type C failed in flight, and all examples were grounded. Work to strengthen the wing design was carried out {{under the direction of}} Professor Richard Knoller but this was not yet complete when war broke out. Six Type Cs were immediately put back into action, with the grounding of the others being lifted shortly afterwards. The design proved too slow and too fragile for operational service, and was quickly reassigned to secondary roles. In February 1915, the Luftschiffabteilung revised its designation system to match that in use by Germany, and the Type C was redesignated B.II. Later the same year, a new and strengthened wing was fitted to all remaining B.IIs, and the B.II (along with the B.I) was put back into production under licence at Flugzeugwerk Fischamend for use as trainers.|$|E
500|$|The {{opposite}} of homologous organs are analogous organs which do similar jobs in two taxa {{that were not}} present in their last common ancestor but rather evolved separately. For example, the wings of insects and birds evolved independently in widely separated groups, and converged functionally to support powered flight, so they are analogous. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sycamore maple seed and <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures. A structure can be homologous at one level, but only analogous at another. Pterosaur, bird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods, and evolved in different ways in the three groups. Thus, in the pterosaurs, the [...] "wing" [...] involves both the forelimb and the hindlimb. Analogy is called homoplasy in cladistics, and convergent or parallel evolution in evolutionary biology.|$|E

After its display on <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Century stage, the train was taken on a 31-state, 222-city publicity tour. More than 2million people saw the train before it entered revenue service.|$|E

500|$|Mendelssohn {{also wrote}} many smaller-scale sacred works for unaccompanied choir and for choir with organ. Most {{are written in}} or {{translated}} into English. Amongst the most famous is Hear My Prayer, whose second half contains [...] "O for <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dove," [...] which became often performed as a separate item. The piece is written for full choir, organ, and a treble or soprano soloist. Mendelssohn's biographer Todd comments [...] "The very popularity of the anthem in England later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian mores".|$|E
500|$|In 1920, an {{arrangement}} was made whereby all the boy choristers of the Temple Church, were given scholarships at the City of London School. In 1926, this arrangement {{was extended to}} the boy choristers of the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace. The choristers included Ernest Lough whose recording of Mendelssohn's [...] "O for <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dove" [...] with the Temple Choir in 1927 made him world-famous; {{it was the first}} classical record to sell (by 1962) more than a million copies. Other musicians educated at the City of London School include the cellist Steven Isserlis.|$|E

Throughout his mourning, Mac continues his new life with Rosa Lee and Sonny. In the final scene, Sonny finds a football Mac has left him as a gift. Mac watches the hotel from a field across the road and sings [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dove" [...] to himself.
