40|$|The {{repeated}} annual use of herbicides {{to control}} wild oats (Avena ludoviciana and A. fatua) was investigated. In {{the first trial}} the wild oat seed density in the soil after a wheat crop was less than the initial soil seed density only after treatment with <b>tri-allate</b> at 0. 85 kg combined with barban 0. 175 kg/ha. Seed numbers in the soil had declined 5 months after the crop, so that the number in the <b>tri-allate</b> plots was also {{less than one year}} previously. In a four-year trial, <b>tri-allate</b> and trifluralin (0. 4 kg/ha) produced levels of wild oat control which resulted in grain yield increases between 55...|$|E
40|$|At about eleven {{times after}} {{application}} of <b>tri-allate,</b> ethoprophos and parathion to a sandy soil, their rates of volatilization {{were determined by}} the aerodynamic method (AD), the Bowen-ratio method (BR), the theoretical-profile method (TP) and the Box method. The volatilization was highest for <b>tri-allate</b> and lowest for parathion. On the first day after application, the volatilization rate decreased sharply, but thereafter the decrease was more gradual. The differences in volatilization rate as determined with the AD, BR and TP methods were comparatively small. The rates determined with the Box method were mostly lower than those determined with the other methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{comparison}} of detection limits of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in {{selected ion monitoring}} (SIM) with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with both electron ionization (EI) and negative-ion chemical ionization (NCI) are presented for over 50 pesticides ranging from organochlorines (OCs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and pre-emergent herbicides used in the Canadian prairies (<b>tri-allate,</b> trifl uralin, ethalfl uralin). The developed GC-EI/SIM, GC-NCI/SIM, and GC-NCI/SRM are suitable for the determina-tion of pesticides in air sample extracts at concentrations 100 pg µL− 1 (100 pg m− 3 in air). No one method {{could be used to}} analyze the range of pre-emergent herbicides, OPs, and OCs investigated. In general GC-NCI/SIM provided the lowest method detection limits (MDLs commonly 2. 5 – 10 pg µL− 1) along with best confi rmation (25 % RSD of ion ratio), while GC-NCI/SRM is recommended for use where added selectivity or confi rmation is required (such as parathion-ethyl, toku-thion, carbofenothion). GC-EI/SRM at concentration 100 pg µL− 1 was not suitable for most pesticides. GC-EI/SIM wa...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study aims {{to compare}} the {{pesticide}} residues dietary intakes of the French general population and the vegetarian one, separated in five specific diets: omnivorous (OMN), lacto-vegetarian (LV), ovo-lacto-vegetarian (OLV), pesco-lacto-vegetarian (PLV) and vegan (VG). Theoretical Maximum Daily Intakes (TMDIs) based on Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) were calculated {{as a percentage of}} the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Among the 421 pesticides studied, only 48 have TMDI above ADI for at least one population subgroup. An excessive exposure is noticed for 44, 43, 42, 41 and 30 pesticides in the OLV, VG, OMN, LV and PLV groups respectively vs. 29 in the general population. Meat and egg products consumption is responsible for higher intakes of organochlorine pesticides in the general population than in the vegetarian one (TDMI = 348 % vs. 146 to 183 % ADI for Aldrin). However, as the limited consumption of animal-origin commodities is largely offset by a higher fruit, vegetable and cereal consumption in the vegetarian diets, vegetarians appear to be preferentially exposed to pesticides for which fruit, vegetables and cereals are the main contributors, such as <b>Tri-allate,</b> Chlorpyrifos-methyl and Diazinon. This study illustrates that consumption habits have a real impact on the pesticide exposure in terms of intake levels, number and kind of pesticides representing potentially a risk of dietary exposure. Except for organochlorine compounds, the vegetarian population may be more exposed to pesticides residues than the general one due to specific dietary habits. Thus, this population is to be considered for risk assessment of pesticide residues...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} matrix effects arising from river water samples using C 18 SPE columns in the {{determination}} of 38 pesticides having different chemical properties is presented. Recoveries from river water samples of different origin {{and the influence of}} prefiltration step, pH and ionic strength were tested. A calibration equation for the extraction method was calculated by using the statistical method of linear regression, the independent variable being the amount of analyte added and the deppendent variable, the amount of recovered analyte. Extractions were carried out in waters spiked with 65 to 1600 nh L- 1 of organophosphorus and nitrogen-containing pesticides, and with 12, 5 to 320 ng L- 1 of halogenated pesticides. Only trifluralin, captan, aldrin, <b>tri-allate,</b> α-BHC, γ -BHC, and azinphos-methyl behavior could not be described through a linear relationship dueto low precision and, possibly, to interferences caused by the matrix sample. Linearity, analytical sensitivity, precision and limit of detection were established for 31 compounds. Slope values in the regression equation ranged from 0, 68 to 0, 98, the exception being amitraz (0. 43), dieldrin (0, 51), and 4, 4 'DDT (0, 58), which accounted for losses prodeced in the extraction process. Systematic errors were detected for most of the compounds and they could be corrected by using the calibration data obtained for the whole analytical process. The detection limits established through the model in most of the cases were lower than the maximum allowed limit for waters by the European Union (100 ng L- 1), ranging from 7 to 21 ng L- 1 for pesticides determined by GC-ECD, and from 20 to 120 ng L- 1 (Except triadimeton, 220) for those determined by GC-NPD...|$|E
40|$|Directive 2013 / 39 /EU {{amending}} the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has introduced the new “Watch List” monitoring mechanism {{in order to}} collect high-quality Union-wide monitoring data {{for the purpose of}} supporting future prioritisation exercises. Diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol, and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol were identified in Directive 2013 / 39 /EU for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been tasked with proposing seven substances as candidates for the completion of the 1 st Watch List and identifying analytical methods for their monitoring. The procedure and criteria used to identify a short-list of substances for possible inclusion in the Watch List is described in the JRC Science and Policy Report “Development of the 1 st Watch List under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive" (Carvalho et al., 2015). EU Member States and stakeholder groups had the opportunity to comment on the proposed substances and on the analytical methods, whose availability was a criterion for the selection of the compounds. The finally proposed 10 (groups of) substances for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List are diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), oxadiazon, methiocarb, 2, 6 -ditert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, <b>tri-allate,</b> neonicotinoid insecticides as a group (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), and 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -methoxycinnamate. Analytical methods for additional substances were searched and investigated because they were among those considered for inclusion in the list, but either did not fulfil all selection criteria, in some cases because enough monitoring data were found to exist already, or were not ranked highly enough. These substances were trichlorfon, cyclododecane, aminotriazole (amitrole), dimethenamid-P, diflufenican, dichlofluanid, formaldehyde, triphenyl phosphate, tolylfluanid, ciprofloxacin, and free cyanide. Little or no information on analytical methods was found for trichlorfon, aminotriazole, cyclododecane, and tolylfluanid. For the other compounds analytical methods are available and published. Some of them have already been analysed in the aquatic environment. The analysis of free cyanide in water is difficult. The available analytical methods do not reach the proposed PNEC value of 0. 26 µg/l. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
