25|$|Rendezvous {{in orbit}} {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed {{to catch up with}} another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> and go to the same orbit as the other. To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time she reached the straits, Scipione Africano, which had {{installed}} an EC-3 ter Gufo search radar, spotted four small vessels lying 10,000 mt ahead, between Reggio di Calabria and Cape Pellaro, initially misidentified by the Italian commander, captain Ernesto Pellegrini, as friendly motor barges. A closer look to the maneuvers of the leading vessel at 2:13 convinced Pellegrino that the craft were actually hostile motor torpedo boats, and the captain ordered <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> from 24 to 30 knots.|$|E

25|$|The {{modernization}} work on {{the four}} Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. <b>To</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters {{were added to the}} ship's length to improve the coefficient of fineness. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the s and the s, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.|$|E
25|$|At 13:30 on 28 May, the Italians {{believed}} that three cruisers and six destroyers of the Royal Navy were steaming up towards the northern coast of Crete {{in support of}} Allied troops, but the Royal Navy was fully occupied evacuating the Crete garrison. The Italians assumed that the Royal Navy force would be off Sitia, the planned landing site, by 17:00 and the commander decided that the slowest ship of the convoy would be taken in tow by Lince <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> and Crispi was detached to shell the lighthouse at Cape Sideros. The 3,000 men of the division and their equipment were on shore by 17:20 and advanced west unopposed, rendezvousing with the Germans at Ierapetra. The Italian troops later moved their headquarters from Sitia to Agios Nikolaos.|$|E

25|$|Because low speeds are {{required}} for traffic entering roundabouts, they are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction radially; whereas rotaries are frequently designed <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speeds,</b> and thus have roads that enter the traffic circle tangentially.|$|R

He failed to inform the captains of Nymphe and Loreley of his decision to withdraw, and they continued to steam east for several minutes before they conformed to his maneuver. At this time, Dockum shifted fire to Nymphe and scored several hits, including damage to her funnel that reduced her speed temporarily. Dockum attempted to overtake and cut off Nymphe and Loreley from Arcona, but Nymphes crew was able to quickly repair the damage she had sustained, allowing her <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed,</b> though she continued to take hits.|$|E

500|$|It was at {{this point}} that the first {{indication}} that something was dangerously amiss during the transit occurred. The executive officer, who passed through the chart room while preparing for the shift change, noticed that Missouri was rapidly approaching the shoal water, and promptly told Morris [...] "For God's sake watch it!" [...] At the same time a discussion occurred on the eighth-level bridge as to whether it would be advisable for the battleship's speed to be increased to 15knots. Morris and Millet differed in opinion on the idea; the former felt speed should be reduced five knots, and the latter felt that any steady speed held during the transition would be okay. Captain Brown therefore decided <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> to 15knots, and the engine room replied by increasing power.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, BR {{authorities}} identified {{a need to}} replace the ageing trains operating the Glasgow to Edinburgh shuttle services, in order <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>speed</b> and reliability.

The locomotives would be known as Class 47/7 and would be fitted with TDM push-pull equipment [...] and long-range fuel tanks, and be maintained to operate at [...] The conversions began in 1979 and the service was operated completely by them from 1980. In 1985, the push-pull service spread to Glasgow-Aberdeen services, and a further four locomotives were converted. The sub-class therefore comprised Nos. 47701 to 47716, though a further locomotive, 47717, was converted in 1988 after the fire-damaged 47713 was withdrawn.|$|E
