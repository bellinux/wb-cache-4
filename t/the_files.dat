5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was ensure that <b>the</b> <b>files</b> {{would be placed}} in the CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access <b>the</b> <b>files</b> within. The move prevents the public from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting File System (EFS) {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with BitLocker to provide protection once the operating system is running. Protection of <b>the</b> <b>files</b> from processes and users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as EFS. BitLocker and EFS, therefore, offer protection against different classes of attacks.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{ranged from}} 400 to 700 to 900 {{unauthorized}} file disclosures.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all <b>the</b> <b>files</b> required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, <b>the</b> <b>files</b> included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E

Two U.S. Marshals receive a similar phone call about an escaped prisoner. The drug dealers arrive in pairs as the man attempts to gain access to <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> Just as he does, the two Marshals appear and order everyone onto the floor, causing a shootout.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{operating}} systems require {{the user to}} allocate the maximum size of <b>the</b> <b>file</b> when <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is created. <b>The</b> <b>file</b> can then be allocated as contiguous disk blocks. In that case, to convert <b>the</b> <b>file</b> block address [...] into a disk block address, the operating system simply adds <b>the</b> <b>file</b> block address [...] to {{the address of the}} first disk block constituting <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> <b>The</b> scheme is simple, but <b>the</b> <b>file</b> cannot exceed its created size.|$|R
5000|$|A File Record stores {{a variety}} of {{metadata}} about <b>the</b> <b>file</b> including its CNID, the size of <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> three timestamps (when <b>the</b> <b>file</b> was created, last modified, last backed up), <b>the</b> first <b>file</b> extents of <b>the</b> data and resource forks and pointers to <b>the</b> <b>file's</b> first data and resource extent records in <b>the</b> Extent Overflow <b>File.</b> <b>The</b> <b>File</b> Record also stores two 16 byte fields that are used by the Finder to store attributes about <b>the</b> <b>file</b> including things like its creator code, type code, <b>the</b> window <b>the</b> <b>file</b> should appear in and its location within the window.|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{stages of the}} film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> This necessitated recreating the models from scratch.

However, the Intersect was so unstable that it plagued Hartley's mind and deleting his personality as Hartley Winterbottom, instead he started {{to believe that he}} was Alexei Volkoff, an international arms dealer, and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|EFS {{works by}} {{encrypting}} a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as <b>the</b> <b>File</b> Encryption Key, or FEK), {{which is used}} because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher were used. The symmetric key used to encrypt <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is then encrypted with a public key associated with the user who encrypted <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> and this encrypted data is stored in the header of <b>the</b> encrypted <b>file.</b> To decrypt <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system uses <b>the</b> private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in <b>the</b> <b>file</b> header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> Because this is done at <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system level, it is transparent to the user.|$|R

5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point <b>the</b> <b>files</b> for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E

The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E

The server receives <b>the</b> <b>file</b> name from <b>the</b> client, but does not know whether the client had permission to write <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> When <b>the</b> server opens <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> system uses the server’s permission, not the client’s.

Munemori of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. A 1996 study commissioned by the United States Army by order of Congress investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals during World War II. The Command History Office at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at the Presidio of Monterey, California was tasked with identifying affected service-members and reviewing the records. After performing a review of <b>the</b> <b>files,</b> the study recommended that several Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service Cross during World War II should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.
