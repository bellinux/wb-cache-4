5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs.</b> In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than {{the wings of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately than the latter, and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke, they save 35 percent energy during flight. The membranes are also delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and adapt to changing airflow; the primary use is to judge what the most efficient speed to fly at is, and possibly also to avoid stalls. Insectivorous bats may also use <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> while performing complex manouvres while attempting to capture prey in-flight.|$|E

40|$|The writer {{undertook}} {{an examination}} of the type specimen of Olivieria because it seemed well suited to a study of the sensory nerve supply of the muzzle. Ever since Watson (1931) suggested that one might gauge the sensitivity, suppleness and therefore the possible hairiness of the muzzle by studying the size, numbers and position of the sensory nerve foramina in the fossil skull, it has seemed likely to point, albeit indirectly, to the origin of hair in the pre-mammalian stem. Such an abundance of nerves supplying the muzzle in scaloposaurid and bauriamorph reptiles would hardly be needed for scaly and inelastic cheeks. More probably, as Brink (1956) has emphasized, a mammalian type of <b>tactile</b> <b>hair</b> with soft cheeks had already come into being in these animals...|$|R
40|$|The Merkel cell is a {{distinctive}} cell normally {{found in the}} epidermis of mammals. It possesses a folded nucleus; a clear, organelle-rich cytoplasm with peripheral protrusions among the epithelial cells; and a few desmosomal attachments to adjacent cells. The cytoplasm is characterized by many dense-cored, membrane-bound granucles, 80 to 100 nm in diameter and distributed in the cytoplasm next to the nerve termination. The Merkel cell is found isolated in the epidermis or associated with epithelial nerve endings such as the hederiform ending of Merkel-Ranvier, the <b>tactile</b> <b>hair</b> disk of pinkus, and the organ of Eimer. It may be observed in the dermis in relation to nerve trunks and also within the corpuscles of Grandry found in {{the skin of the}} duck bill. The merkel cell appears to be an individual cell type, probably derived from the neural crest. Which is capable of living in union with neural and epithelial cells. The Merkel cell penetrates the epidermis in fetal life and functions as a specific, slowly adapting, sensory touch receptor...|$|R

Vibrissae are blood filled sinuses bound by a dense connective tissue capsule with sensitive nerve endings that provides haptic feedback to the manatee.|$|E
50|$|Most {{marmosets}} {{are about}} 20 cm long. Relative to other monkeys, they show some apparently primitive features: they have claws rather than nails, and <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on their wrists. They lack wisdom teeth, and their brain layout {{seems to be}} relatively primitive. Their body temperature is unusually variable, changing by up to 4 °C (7 °F) in a day. Marmosets are native to South America and {{have been found in}} Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru. They have also been spotted in Central America and Mexico. They are also raised in captivity as pets.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the vibrissae of {{seals and}} sea lions, Florida {{manatees}} also use hairs for detecting tactile and hydrodynamic stimuli. However, manatees are unique since these <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> are located {{over the whole}} post-cranial body {{in addition to the}} face. These hairs have different densities at different locations of the body, with higher density on the dorsal side and density decreasing ventrally. The effect of this distribution in spatial resolution is unknown. This system, distributed over the whole body, could localize water movements analogous to a lateral line.|$|E
25|$|Scorpions are {{opportunistic}} predators {{of small}} arthropods, although the larger kinds {{have been known}} to kill small lizards and mice. The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive <b>tactile</b> <b>hair,</b> and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with neurotoxic venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using chelicerae, small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the Chelicerata among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a pre-oral cavity below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, exoskeleton, etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity, which is ejected by the scorpion.|$|R
40|$|The {{innervation}} of {{the skirt}} of hairless mice {{has been studied}} following induction of epidermal hyperplasia by physical and chemical methods. Physical stimuli comprised ultraviolet irradiation, heat, wounding, and friction. Effective chemicals included benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, creosote, formaldehyde, hexadecane, hydrobromic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, and turpentine. Epidermal hyperplasia, however produced, was associated with growth of sensory nerve fibers into the outer part of the epidermis. Following a single 10 -min exposure to an ultraviolet sunlamp at 40 cm, the nerves extended into the epidermis within 24 hr and disappeared during the second week as the epidermis reverted to its normal thickness. Repeated irradiation (until tumors appeared) was accompanied by persistent hyperplasia and neural invasion. Of 32 papillomas examined, intraepithelial nerves were found in 28. The presence and location of nerves in the tumor epithelium {{were related to the}} incorporation of <b>tactile</b> <b>hair</b> disc epithelium. The hyperplastic regenerative epithelium at the margins of skin ulcers were also invaded by nerves which sometimes followed the migrating epithelium across the ulcer floor. Since the regenerative epithelium was not directly treated, it was concluded that the proliferation of nervous tissue in response to skin injury {{was the result of the}} hyperplasia per se, regardless of the method used to produce it...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Study is {{determination}} of histogenesis of the facial skin in ghezel sheep. The study was {{in the form of}} descriptive observation conducted on 100 male sheep fetuses which were collected randomly from pregnant ewes at Tabriz abbatoine. The length of the collected fetuses were measured and their age calculated by the formula X= 2. 1 (Y+ 17) to be between 40 to 130 days old. Following fixation of the fetuses in 10 % buffered formalin samples were separated from the face region having individual and <b>tactile</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. They were studied histologically after the histotechnique and H&E staining procedures. In initial stages of facial skin development, the epidermal layer consisted of a row of cuboidal cells (basal layer) covered by a row of squamus cells, the periderm. At the 8 th week of gestation the intermediate layer was formed by multiplication of germinal layer cells which was converted to spinosus cell layer at the 14 th week of gestation. The skin was cornified at the last trimester of gestation. Formation of hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands began at the 9 th week of gestation. Sebaceous and sweat glands formed from primary hair follicles and the appearance of myoepithelial cells coincides with the formation of sweet glands. Unlike other mammals in which hair follicle grows obliquely, vertical growth of hair follicle was observed in sheep. It was concluded that the 13 th week of gestation is a critical period in the appearance of most ovine fetal akin structures as mellanocytes, myoepithelial cells, sebaceous and sweet glands appear at this time. Based on {{the results of the present}} study, the developmental pattern of sheep embryonic skin is similar to that observed in man and other mammals...|$|R

50|$|The fur of {{the large}} Mindoro forest mouse is soft and smooth. The hairs of the dorsal fur are light gray near the root, and dark brown at the tip. Between the normal hairs are many black <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs.</b> This makes the dorsal fur appear dark brown, {{although}} recently captured animals have a dark blue-green hue. Some animals are darker around the midline of the back, and all are a lighter colour at the flanks. The colour of the ventral fur varies between animals, with it being a yellow-brown colour in some, slightly lighter coloured than the dorsal fur in others, still others having gray hairs with brown or silver-coloured tips in the ventral fur, and finally some animals showing {{no difference between the}} dorsal and ventral fur at all.|$|E

40|$|Navigation is {{an ideal}} {{behavioral}} model {{for the study of}} sensory system integration and the neural substrates associated with complex behavior. For this broader purpose, however, it may be profitable to develop new model systems that are both tractable and sufficiently complex to ensure that information derived from a single sensory modality and path integration are inadequate to locate a goal. Here, we discuss some recent discoveries related to navigation by amblypygids, nocturnal arachnids that inhabit the tropics and sub-tropics. Nocturnal displacement experiments under the cover of a tropical rainforest reveal that these animals possess navigational abilities that are reminiscent, albeit on a smaller spatial scale, of true-navigating vertebrates. Specialized legs, called antenniform legs, which possess hundreds of olfactory and <b>tactile</b> sensory <b>hairs,</b> and vision appear to be involved. These animals also have enormous mushroom bodies, higher-order brain regions that, in insects, integrate contextual cues and may be involved in spatial memory. In amblypygids, the complexity of a nocturnal rainforest may impose navigational challenges that favor the integration of information derived from multimodal cues. Moreover, the movement of these animals is easily studied in the laboratory and putative neural integration sites of sensory information can be manipulated. Thus, amblypygids could serve as a model system for the discovery of neural substrates associated with a unique and potentially sophisticated navigational capability. The diversity of habitats in which amblypygids are found also offers an opportunity for comparative studies of sensory integration and ecological selection pressures on navigation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Farmers who are {{interested}} to rear calves together with the dairy cows during the first weeks of life are confronted with problems of poor milk let-down during machine milking. This study investigates the influence of three calf-associated stimuli during milking on milk yield, milk content and milk flow characteristics: olfactory (calf <b>hair),</b> <b>tactile</b> (teat massage) and acoustic (recorded calf calls) stimulation including 14 dairy cows with permanent contact to their calves (group KM) and 22 control cows (group M). All cows were milked twice daily. Stimulation tests were conducted in three consecutive weeks during day 25 - 51 of lactation, each stimulus tested in four milkings versus four milkings without stimulation. Mixed models with the fixed factors stimulation (vs. no stimulation), group, time of day, interaction stimulation*group and the random factor cows were applied for each stimulus. Stimulations had only minor effects on the measured parameters and did thus not improve the existing milkability of the dairy cows with and without calf contact. Differences between the groups were significant. KM-cows had a decreased milk yield of ca. 10 kg per milking and reduced fat content of about 1 %. Also milk flow was lower than in M-cows. Further research {{on how to improve}} milk let-down of cows with calf contact should pay attention to the duration of pre-stimulation and the length of daily calf contact...|$|R
40|$|Farmers who are {{interested}} to rear calves together with the dairy cows during the first weeks of life are confronted with problems of poor milk let-down during machine milking. Therefore it was investigated whether 3 calf-associated stimuli were capable to enhance milkability of the cows. In this contribution, {{the effect of the}} stimulations during milking on heart rate (HR) and agitation (rumination, posture of the head and behaviour during udder preparation) are presented. Olfactory (calf <b>hair),</b> <b>tactile</b> (teat massage) and acoustic(recorded calf calls) stimulation were tested on 15 dairy cows with permanent contact to their calves and 22 control cows. All cows were milked twice daily. Stimulation tests were conducted in 3 consecutive weeks during day 25 – 51 of lactation, each stimulus tested in 4 milkings versus 4 routine milkings. As HR was only measured at morning milkings there were only 2 repetitions per stimulus. Mixed models with the fixed factors stimulation (vs. routine milking), calf-contact, breed (German Red Pied vs. German Holstein) and parity (primiparous vs. pluriparous) and the random factor animal were applied for each parameter. Rumination and posture of the head were not influenced by any factor. Agitation behaviour and HR in the parlour were not affected by calf-contact. This questions stress as elicitor of problems with milk ejection. Tactile stimulation had an increasing, acoustic stimulation a decreasing effect on HR. German Red Pied showed more agitation behaviour during udder preparation and a higher HR in this phase compared to the German Holsteins. This could be due to differences in temperament or sensitivity to touching. According to expectations, primiparous cows showed more agitation during udder preparation than pluriparous, but this was not accompanied by an HR increase. The results did not indicate higher stress reactions in the parlour of dairy cows with calf contact. Acoustic stimulation led to a lower HR independent from calf-contact compared with HR at routine milking...|$|R
40|$|A~aSTRACT When all {{roots to}} the sixth {{ganglion}} of the crayfish are cut, the caudal photoreceptor unit (PRU) fires at regular intervals.

40|$|The long <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> of crickets {{contribute}} to intersegmental receptive fields of interneurones that integrate input from {{different types of}} tactile mechano-sensory hairs. Afferent input from the identified long hairs studied converges {{on a group of}} multisegmental interneurones of the abdominal and thoracic ganglia. Conversely, the input from each tactile hair receptor diverges to several multisegmental interneurones and also to motoneurones of their own and neighbouring segments. The interneu-rones have spike initiating zones in each ganglion they reach. Spikes initiated by hair afferents can travel caudally and rostrally in an interneu-rone. These interneurones spreading tactile information from single sensory cells to several ganglia are not suited for fine discrimination of sources of touch which could elicit specific somatotopically oriented motor behaviour of the cricket.

40|$|The {{responses}} of <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> located on {{legs of the}} desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Forska°l) are modulated by nitric oxide (NO).

The spike response rates of mechanosensory neurons of low-threshold hairs decreased when exposed to elevated NO levels caused by perfusion of the leg with saline containing the NO donor PAPANONOate. In contrast, in high-threshold hairs, which show low responsiveness under control conditions, an increase in spike rates was observed during PAPANONOate application. These opposing effects of NO reduce the differences in the spike {{responses of}} the two types of <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> to mechanical stimulation and are likely {{to have an impact on}} behaviours elicited by mechanical stimulation of the legs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Spiders {{can sense}} sounds in a {{frequency}} range between approximately 40 and 600 Hz {{by the use}} of hairs; they can detect e. g. the puff of wind of buzzing flies.

To integrate the advantages of both types of sensoric hairs, this article presents an artificial auditory-tactile sensor system, which combines the principles of the auditory hairs of spiders and the <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> of scorpions, and investigates some neural techniques for processing these sensor signals. The different types of signals are discerned by recurrent neural networks {{in such a way that}} their output can generate different reactive behavior, like obstacle avoidance and tropism, of a walking machine.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This is a neuroanatomical and ethological {{study of}} the pectines, the primary chemosensory organs of {{scorpions}} (Arachnida: Scorpiones). The pectines are paired, ventromedial appendages that brush the substrate as the scorpion walks. This comb-like organ consists of a supportive spine {{and an array of}} teeth. Each tooth supports hundreds of setaform sensilla called pegs. The peripheral neuroanatomy of sensilla on the teeth and spine were described. Below the peg sensilla on the pectinal teeth were three histological layers consisting of dendrites, neuronal somata, and a layer of peripheral synapses. The neuronal cell layer within the teeth was further divided into inner and outer sub-larninae, comprised of chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons. The peg sensilla were innervated by iterative cassettes of sensory neurons orthogonal to the layers described. Sensory hairs on the pectinal spine resembled arachnid tactile and chemosensory hairs. The central projection patterns of sensory afferents from <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on the pectinal spine and peg sensilla on the pectinal teeth were compared. The internal architecture of the neuropile serving the pectines was also characterized. The pectinal neuropile contained a basal disk and a terminal cap. The cap was divided into a fibrous cortex and a medullar region of glomeruli. Sensory afferents from the <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on the spine were aligned topographically in the pectinal neuropile, but were restricted to the outer cortex. Sensory afferents from the bimodal peg sensilla terminated in both regions of the pectinal neuropil, suggesting that the cortex and medulla are functionally divided into mechanosensory and chemosensory processing areas. Behavioral experiments were conducted using a Y-maze choice test to determine if male scorpions were capable of trailing female conspecifics. A significant proportion of male scorpions preferred the arm of the Y-maze that a conspecific female had walked down and pre-courtship behaviors were only evoked when male scorpions contacted substrates that had been exposed to a female scorpion. The results from this experiment suggest that scorpions may use chemical cues to find potential mates and to initiate courtship...|$|E

Rats and mice actively move these whiskers during exploration. The neuronal mechanisms controlling whisker movements and the sensory representation of whisker tactile information are widely studied as a model for sensorimotor processing in mammals. Studies of the natural whisker movement patterns during exploration and tactile examination are still in their early stages. Tracking the movements of whiskers is technically challenging as they move relatively fast and are very thin, particularly in mice. Existing systems detect light-beam interruptions by the whiskers or use high-speed video to track whisker movements in one or two dimensions. Here we describe a method for tracking the movements of mouse whiskers in 3 dimensions (3 D) using using optical motion capture technology. Optical motion capture technology tracks the movements of small retro-reflective markers attached to whiskers of a head-fixed mouse with a spatial resolution of < 0. 5 mm in all three dimensions and a temporal resolution of 5 msec (200 fps).

40|$|Preprint / Technische Universität Ilmenau, Institut für Mathematik; 15 - 07 Abstract: Rodents, like {{mice and}} rats, use <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> in the snout region (mystacial vibrissae) to acquire {{information}} about their environment, e. g. the shape or contour of obstacles. For this, the vibrissa {{is used for the}} perception of stimuli due to an object contact. Mechanoreceptors are processing units of this stimuli measured in the compliant support (follicle sinus complex). We use this behavior from biology as an inspiration to set up a mechanical model for object contour scanning. An elastic bending rod interacts with a rigid obstacle in the plane. Analyzing only one quasi-static sweep of the rod along the obstacle (in contrast to literature), we determine a) the support reactions (the only observables of the problem), and then b) the (discrete) obstacle contour in form of a set of contact points. In doing this, we first assume a stiff support (clamping) of the vibrissa, but in a next step we increase the elasticity of the support in focussing on a bearing with a rotational spring (also to control or delimitate the bending moment at the support). Thereby, we present a fully analytical treatment of the non-linear differential equations emerging from Bernoulli’s rod theory and a representation by Standard Elliptic Integrals.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{responses of}} the neurons associated with {{the various types of}} chemosensory hairs of the blowfly, Phormia regina Meigen, following stimulation by chemical and mechanical means have been studied. The singly innervated chemosensory hairs on the ovipositor, maxillary palpi, and antennae respond vigorously to chemical stimulation, but not to mechanical stimulation. The triply innervated chemosensory hairs on the labellum, tarsus, and wing have two neurons which respond only to chemical stimuli. The third neuron responds only to mechanical stimulation. The differential {{responses of the}} two chemosensory neurons to various chemical stimuli following the removal of the tip of the hair suggest that the structures responsible for chemoreception are located throughout the distal processes of these neurons. The response of the third neuron to mechanical stimulation is similar to the response recorded from the neuron associated with one type of tactile hair which responds to motion and not to steady deformation. Recordings have been made from the neurons associated with purely <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> using the cut hair {{as an extension of the}} micropipette.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the central projections of leg proprioceptors important in resistance reflexes {{and in the}} control of leg movement in the stick insect. The following proprioceptors were studied: the femoral chordotonal organ and the campaniform sensilla on the proximal femur, the hair plate, the hair field and three groups of campaniform sensilla on the trochanter, and the two hair plates and four hair rows on the coxa. For comparison, single <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on the sternum, coxa, trochanter, and femur were also investigated. Afferent fibers were backfilled with cobalt and the central projections were studied in wholemounts and in sections. Results are compared with those from other insects and arthropods. Results for all three thoracic ganglia are similar. Projections of all the proprioceptors are confined to the ipsilateral half of the segmental ganglion. They all terminate in four common target areas - two each in the lateral and in the intermediate part of the hemiganglion. The two lateral areas lie rostrally and caudally in dorsal neuropile occupied by motoneuron processes. The two intermediate areas lie rostrally and caudally in midventral neuropile lateral to the ventral intermediate tract (VIT). These intermediate areas include part of the ventral coarse-grained neuropile (vcN). Target areas of different proprioceptors overlap considerably, but the intermediate projections of the campaniform sensilla lie slightly closer together {{than those of the}} other organs. In addition to these four areas, the afferent fibers of the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO) project to two medial target areas extending into neuropile medial to the VIT. Afferent fibers from the various sense organs reach these common target areas using different pathways, but these pathways share some common elements. Afferent fibers from one organ can follow several alternative pathways to the common target areas. The intermediate areas are reached by projections which form a rostral and a caudal prong extending medially in midventral neuropile. Fibers enter these rostral and caudal prongs either along the lateral margin of the ganglion (a path referred to as a lateral longitudinal bundle) or by crossing {{from one to the other}} through coarse-grained neuropile occupying the central core of each hemiganglion (a path referred to as an intermediate longitudinal bundle). Collaterals entering the dorsolateral target areas rise either directly along the margin of the neuropile or from the intermediate longitudinal bundle. The medial target areas of the fCO projections are reached by a third branch which proceeds from the margin of the ganglion medioventrally between the anterior and posterior prongs and then bifurcates. Fibers from different organs follow different routes to reach common target areas. In addition, fibers from the same organ vary in their distribution among alternative pathways. Projections from <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on the sternum, coxa, trochanter, and femur are quite different from those of the proprioceptive hairs. They proceed medially along the ventral margin of the ganglion to terminate in a loose plexus within medial parts of the ventral association center. ...|$|E
40|$|Orexins (OXA and OXB) are {{peptides}} {{derived from}} a common precursor called prepro-orexin. They act through G-protein receptors named orexin 1 receptor (OX 1 R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX 2 R). Orexins were first demonstrated in neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and {{found to be related}} to the control of food intake. However, it has been shown that they are widely distributed in both the nervous system and peripheral tissues, including endocrine organs such as the pituitary and adrenal glands. Merkel cells are neuroendocrine cells situated in the epidermis, <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> and oral mucosa, and act as mechanoreceptors. Up to the present, various neuropeptides have been detected in these cells. The aim of the present study was to detect the presence of prepro-orexin and orexin receptors (OX 1 R and OX 2 R) in porcine Merkel cells using immunohistochemistry. Prepro-orexin was expressed in the cytoplasm of Merkel cells in the skin of the pig snout. Immunoreactivity for prepro-orexin was more intense in the mature side of the cell, where the dense-cored granules are accumulated. Epidermal nerve terminals associated with Merkel cells and dermal nerve fibres showed no immunostaining. Both orexin receptors (OX 1 R and OX 2 R) were also demonstrated in the cytoplasm of Merkel cells of pig snout skin. The finding of orexins and their receptors in Merkel cells suggests that they have an autocrine function. Further studies are needed to ascertain the significance of this function...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{changes may}} affect aimed limb {{movements}} by altering limb mass, muscle strength and musculo-skeletal resistance or changing {{the position of}} a target on the body relative to the responding limb. Scratching movements following stimulation of wings by 5 th instars and adult Schistocerca gregaria were compared before and after the imaginal moult, during which the wings increase in length and rotate, presenting different wing surfaces to external contact. The arrangement of mechanosensory hairs on the wings of 5 th instars and adults was determined and associated with the development of scratching behaviour. The neuronal projections of mechanosensory hairs on the hind wing projected intersegmentally to anterior ventral association centre (aVAC) of the metathoracic ganglion and continued intersegmentally to the mesothoracic aVAC. Scratching movements accommodated developmental changes that occurred between the 5 th instar and adulthood of S. gregaria. There was no change in movement characteristics between 5 th instars and adults, indicating that developmental changes in the muscle strength, limb mass and musculo-skeletal resistance were compensated. Movements were appropriately aimed to accommodate the increase in wing size, and were associated with stimulation of <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on different wing surfaces in 5 th instars and adults, implying different synaptic connections onto post-synaptic interneurones. Therefore, changes in limb mass, muscle strength and musculo-skeletal resistance due to growth are be compensated for, possible mechanism are proprioceptive reflexes and dynamic joint stiffness. Changes in target position caused by body growth may be facilitated by the development of new mechanosensory hairs and different synaptic connections onto postsynaptic interneurones. Wing rotation is likely to be accommodated by the intersegmental projections of wing hair afferents, and the convergence of hind wing and fore wing sensory signals.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the nature of spatial cues in {{determining}} the characteristic projection sites of sensory neurons in the CNS, we have transplanted sensory neurons of the cricket Acheta domesticus to ectopic locations. Thoracic campaniform sensilla (CS) function as proprioceptors and project to an intermediate layer of neuropil in thoracic ganglia while cercal CS transduce tactile information and project into a ventral layer in the terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG). When transplanted to ectopic locations, these afferents retain their modality-specific projection in the host ganglion and terminate in the layer of neuropil homologous to that of their ganglion of origin. Thus, thoracic CS neurons project to intermediate neuropil when transplanted to the abdomen and cercal CS neurons project to a ventral layer of neuropil when transplanted to the thorax. We conclude that CS can be separated into two classes based on their characteristic axonal projections within each segmental ganglion. We {{also found that the}} sensory neurons innervating <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> project to ventral neuropil in any ganglion they encounter after transplantation. Ectopic sensory neurons can form functional synaptic connections with identified interneurons located within the host ganglia. The new contacts formed by these ectopic sensory neurons can be with normal targets, which arborize within the same layer of neuropil in each segmental ganglion, or with novel targets, which lack dendrites in the normal ganglion and are thus normally unavailable for synaptogenesis. These observations suggest that a limited set of molecular markers are utilized for cell-cell recognition in each segmentally homologous ganglion. Regenerating sensory neurons can recognize novel postsynaptic neurons if they have dendrites in the appropriate layer of neuropil. We suggest that spatial constraints produced by the segmentation and the modality-specific layering of the nervous system have a pivotal role in determining synaptic specificity.

40|$|Nomenclature. As {{mentioned}} above, the prosopon and the nymph of the tsutsugamushi {{have many}} characteristics which {{distinguish it from}} the other trombidia. These are the pale color and small size of the body, delicacy of the skin, the conspicuous constriction between the cephalothoracic region and the abdomen, rudimentary eyes and tracheal openings, absence of tracheal capillaries, etc. The fact that the thumb or the appendage of the palpus does not start {{from the side of}} the fourth joint of the latter but from its end, is another charac teristic which does not occur in other trombidia. From the biological point of view two facts should be mentioned; i. e., the adult female does not deposit eggs in heaps, and in contrast to those of other species, the larvaæ hatch out all through the year and feed on mammals. From these characteristics running through all the stages of development, we believe that we are justified in claiming a new genus for the tsutsugamushi. We therefore propose to change the scientific name given to this mite by Brumpt in 1910, Trombidium akamushi, and to introduce instead, according to the suggestion of Drs. Goto and Watase, the name Leptotrombidium akamushi. Determinaton of Leptotrombidium akamushi, N. Sp. Prosopon and Nymph. 1. Pale color. 2. Delicacy of the skin. 3.

40|$|Animals {{move through}} a complex {{environment}} and therefore constantly need to adapt their behavior to the surroundings. For this purpose, they use sensory information of various kind. As one strategy to gain tactile cues, animals perform leg searching movements when loosing foothold. The kinematics of these searching movements {{have been well}} investigated in the stick insect. In this thesis, the modification of stick insect searching movements following a tactile cue are explored {{as an example of}} a sensory-motor system that adapts to environmental conditions. Furthermore, the premotor neuronal network underlying the generation of searching behavior is investigated. Searching movements were studied in animals with a single intact leg that was free to move in the vertical plane. After several cycles of searching movements, a stick was introduced into the plane of movements such that animals would touch it with its distal leg. As is known from previous studies, in such a situation stick insects try to grasp the object that they touch. In my experiments, the stick was retracted as soon as a brief contact with the animals' leg had occurred. Therefore, animals could not grasp the stick. I could show that following this short tactile cue, stick insects modify their searching movements to target the former position of the object (PO). Targeting occurs by a change in two parameters of searching movements: animals (i) shift the average leg position of their searching movements towards the PO and (ii) confine searching movements to the PO by a reduction in movement amplitude. These two parameters, position and amplitude, can be changed independently of each other. Searching movements are flexibly adjusted to different locations of the object which demonstrates the targeted response to be a situation-dependent adaptive behavior. The targeted response outlasts the tactile stimulus by several seconds suggesting a simple form of short term memory of the PO as proposed for targeted movements of other insects. Vision is not necessary for a targeted response. Instead, tactile cues from leg sensory organs are important. Two proprioceptive organs, the trochanteral hairplate (trHP) and the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO), are crucial for targeting. Other sensory organs like <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> and campaniform sensilla are dispensable. The brain is not necessary for a targeted response, therefore the adaptation of searching movements is likely to be mediated on the thoracic level. The premotor neuronal network underlying searching movement generation was investigated using the same single-leg preparation as described above. Nonspiking interneurons (NSIs) of the premotor network were recorded intracellularly during searching movements. Additionally, EMG recordings of the four main leg muscles that generate searching movements in the vertical plane were recorded. The membrane potential of previously described, as well as newly identified NSIs providing synaptic drive to leg motoneurons is shown to be phasically modulated during searching. Therefore, NSIs are part of the premotor network for the generation of searching movements. NSIs that were previously described to contribute to the generation of walking behavior are shown to contribute to the generation of searching behavior. When artificially de- or hyperpolarized by current injection, several NSIs are able to induce changes in searching movement parameters like position, amplitude, velocity of movements, or inter-joint coordination. One NSI is able to drive or stop searching movements. Each NSI acts on a specific set of parameters. The same NSIs that were recorded during searching also were recorded during walking behavior. In comparison, NSI membrane potential modulations during searching are smaller in amplitude and more undulated than during walking. In contrast, fast transitions in NSI membrane potential are closely coupled to step phase transitions during walking. The most prominent difference in NSI membrane potential occurs during step phase (when walking) as compared to flexion phase (during searching). This difference might be attributed to load signals from campaniform sensilla. Analogous to results of previous studies in the stick insect, this highlights the importance of sensory feedback in shaping the motor output. Finally, NSIs were recorded intracellularly while animals with their searching leg made contact with the stick that was introduced into the plane of movement. First results indicate that the response of a given NSI to this contact is characteristic and depends on the direction of touch...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of the {{behaviour}} {{and biology}} of potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella Zell.) relevant to host-plant selection and utilization were investigated. Literature of relevance concerning {{this and other}} insects is reviewed. Oviposition behaviour To {{provide a basis for}} later experimental work the fecundity and oviposition behaviour of individual potato tuber moths was investigated. Fecundity ranged from 0 to 236 eggs deposited per female for moths provided with sugar solution and muslin over filter paper as an oviposition substrate. Fecundity under these conditions was not correlated with pupal weight but the number of mature eggs in the ovaries on emergence from the pupa was related to pupal weight. This initial egg complement accounted for slightly more than half the total number of eggs laid, so that further egg maturation must take place during adult life. Females kept with males throughout their lifespan did not lay more eggs than those separated from males after an initial mating, but unmated females laid very few eggs all of which were infertile. Peak oviposition (of mated females) occurred 2 to 5 days after adult emergence. Mated moths were offered a range of materials in a series of experiments in order to define physically optimum substrates for oviposition. Surface depressions just large enough to accommodate eggs (0. 2 - 0. 5 mm 2) were preferred, but in addition hairy substrates were much more attractive than smooth. Mechanical stimulation of <b>tactile</b> <b>hairs</b> on the ovipositor, which was examined by scanning electron microscopy, may account for these effects. Moist substrates, were highly deterrent for egg laying and also reduced the total number of eggs laid during the experimental period. Four host plants (potato, egg plant, tobacco and tomato) and five non-host plants (silver beet, bean, pea, radish and ryegrass) were evaluated with respect to oviposition behaviour in a series of experiments. It was concluded that acceptable plants contain oviposition stimulant factors whilst unacceptable plants contain deterrent factors. Neither of these are however volatile and act for the most part only on contact. Active extracts were prepared from most plants but no attempt was made to identify individual active constituents. As these factors were released in experimental situations for the most part only when plant tissue was ruptured, it is uncertain how they are detected by the insect in the intact leaf. Strongly stimulative plants such as potato, egg plant and tobacco, induced greater total egg deposition as well as influencing the location of eggs. Factors affecting fecundity Anaesthetization with carbon dioxide as practised to facilitate handling of moths, had no effect on fecundity. Starved moths laid only slightly more eggs than the complement of fully developed eggs in the ovaries at eclosion from the pupa. Moths provided with water laid almost twice as many eggs but provision of 5 % sucrose solution did not increase fecundity further. Moths kept in the presence of potato tubers laid up to twice as many eggs over their life span compared to moths not so exposed. Isolated pieces of potato peel did not produce this effect. The factor(s) responsible for this stimulation of fecundity appears to be one of odour as tubers covered with muslin produced a similar effect compared to those to which moths had access to the surface. Larval behaviour Newly hatched first instar larvae move vigorously and continually in the absence of plant material and would be able to travel several metres before requiring to locate a suitable host plant if eggs were laid away from the plant. Mean life span of starved first instar larvae was 3 - 4 days at 20 °C and was not greatly influenced by relative humidity at this temperature. First instar larvae tend to be positively phototactic but do not respond to moisture. Their ability to locate host plant material is poor and no strongly directional response was detected. Movement is arrested after contact is made with leaf tissue of host plants but not to any extent with non-host plants. Newly hatched first instar larvae begin to feed soon after coming into contact with leaves of host plants but will not feed to any extent on non-host plant tissue. Discriminatory ability is thus inherited. Relative susceptibility of potato cultivars Twelve named potato cultivars were compared for degree of tuber infestation in two small plot trials, one under glass and the other outdoors. Tuber moths were artificially seeded into the experimental areas in each case. Significant differences in degree of infestation were obtained between cultivars in the outdoor trial but not in that under glass. In laboratory tests, differences in oviposition preference were detected between tubers of different cultivars but less so with foliage. Differences were also found between cultivars in the numbers of pupae recovered following the seeding of known numbers of first instar larvae onto tubers. Pricking the surface of tubers resulted in better percentage recovery of pupae for all cultivars. No close correlation was found between percentage pupation and resistance of tuber skin to rupture or with the number of eyes per tuber. Significant differences in fecundity were recorded according to the cultivar on which the larvae were fed. When cultivars were ranked according to oviposition preference (bare tubers), percentage pupation and fecundity, there was a close correlation with ranking based on degree of infestation in the field, suggesting that such factors are largely responsible for the differences in levels of infestation found between cultivars under field conditions...|$|E
