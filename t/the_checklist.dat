At 20:27:32 the captain asked for flaps and landing gear, which were immediately deployed by the first officer and resulted in the aircraft gaining 70meters (200ft) of altitude. The landing gears were confirmed locked at 20:28:00. Four seconds later the passenger asked the captain if there were reserve systems {{which could be used}} if the landing gear did not deploy properly.

40|$|In The Netherlands, {{a system}} to control the {{prevalence}} of Salmonella in the pork supply chain is under development by the Product Boards of Livestock, Meat and Eggs. Therefore, the Animal Sciences Group-Applied Research has developed a tool to support pig-finishing farms to control Salmonella. This tool contains eight <b>checklists.</b> <b>The</b> <b>checklists</b> {{are based on the}} principles of the HACCP methodology. Important hazards and control measures were determined. Each checklist deals with a part of the farm procedures; supply of water, piglets, pelleted feed, cereals, roughage, liquid co-products and hygiene and daily management. By means of the developed tool, farm specific control measures to reduce the introduction and spread of Salmonella can easily be identified by the farmer. The effectiveness and practical feasibility of <b>the</b> <b>checklists</b> are determined by implementing advised measures during eight months at three finishing farms. These farms had a high Salmonella prevalence in august 2001. The finishing pigs were tested bacteriologically and serologically every three months. At the end of the testing period, the farmers completed an evaluation form to get insight in the farmers' opinion of <b>the</b> <b>checklists.</b> <b>The</b> farmers indicated <b>the</b> <b>checklists</b> are user-friendly, complete and recommendable to other pig farmers. The measures that were advised after completing <b>the</b> <b>checklists</b> were mostly general in nature. At one farm the percentage of positive samples decreased. The other two farms had only a few positive samples during the entire research period. To maximise the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>checklists,</b> <b>the</b> <b>checklists</b> should be completed along with a farm adviser or veterinarian. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
