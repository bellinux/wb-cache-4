The Anderson file {{is located in the}} NYPL Archives, which, in addition to the Library of Congress, the National Archives and Records Administration, and FBI, also has their own files on Hasse. As of 2006, the FBI still refuses to release five pages of their file on Hasse.|$|E
25|$|On October 16, 1967, draft card turn-ins {{were held}} across the country, {{yielding}} more than 1,000 draft cards, later returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{as an act}} of civil disobedience. Resisters expected to be prosecuted immediately, but Attorney General Ramsey Clark instead prosecuted a group of ringleaders including Dr. Benjamin Spock and Yale chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr. in Boston in 1968. By the late 1960s, one quarter of all court cases dealt with the draft, including men accused of draft-dodging and men petitioning for the status of conscientious objector. Over 210,000 men were accused of draft-related offenses, 25,000 of whom were indicted.|$|E

25|$|Clemens was alleged by the Mitchell Report to {{have used}} {{anabolic}} steroids during his late career, mainly based on testimony given by his former trainer, Brian McNamee. Clemens firmly denied these allegations under oath before the United States Congress, leading congressional leaders to refer his case <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> on suspicions of perjury. On August 19, 2010, {{a federal grand jury}} at the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., indicted Clemens on six felony counts involving perjury, false statements and Contempt of Congress. Clemens pleaded not guilty, but proceedings were complicated by prosecutorial misconduct, leading to a mistrial. The verdict from his second trial came in June 2012. Clemens was found not guilty on all six counts of lying to Congress in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Martin Sinfield (2132) was {{appointed}} deputy chief judge by Francisco in 2131, in which capacity he assigned Judge Dredd {{to supervise the}} mutant townships being built in the Cursed Earth, and attempted to control Francisco (largely unsuccessfully). Sinfield became acting chief judge in 2132 when Francisco resigned, and immediately set about instituting even harsher new anti-mutant policies and causing great damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> When Sinfield prematurely called off {{a search for a}} missing judge in the Cursed Earth, endangering his life, Dredd lodged a formal complaint against Sinfield with the Council of Five. When the Council dismissed Dredd's claim, Dredd decided to stand for election for chief judge himself. However the election was cancelled after Sinfield was arrested when evidence came to light that he had used illegal means to force Judge Francisco to resign. He was sentenced to 20 years hard labour on Titan.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, DeMarco {{is trying}} to cope with {{adjusting}} to civilian life. Although Dredd is uninterested in her romantically, he retains an interest in her welfare, and he helps her to find a job as a licensed private detective. Her first assignment appears to be a missing person case, but it actually transpires that her client is working for the Frendz Mob, and is using her to locate a man who they wish to kill. DeMarco manages to find their intended victim and save his life, and she calls Dredd to interrogate him. The man reports that he works in a warehouse in which the Judges' new Lawgiver handguns are kept before being shipped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> to replace the old models. He has been bribed to allow the Frendz Mob to exchange the microchips in the weapons with new ones, but does not know why.|$|E

25|$|On July 23, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a June 2015, memorandum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> from the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the State Department regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State. A transmittal memorandum, written by State Dept. official Patrick F. Kennedy, said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.|$|E
500|$|In May 2013, Warren {{sent letters}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve, {{questioning}} their decisions that settling {{rather than going}} to court would be more fruitful. Also in May, suggesting that students should get [...] "the same great deal that banks get", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans {{at the same rate}} that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%., Independent Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill saying: [...] "The only thing wrong with this bill is that [...] thought of it and I didn't".|$|E
500|$|Davis, in his memoirs, {{remarked that}} he chose Benjamin because he [...] "had {{a very high}} {{reputation}} as a lawyer, and my acquaintance {{with him in the}} Senate had impressed me with the lucidity of his intellect, his systematic habits, and capacity for labor". Meade suggested that Davis wanted to have a Louisianan in his Cabinet, but that a smarter course of action would have been to send Benjamin abroad to win over the European governments. Butler called Benjamin's appointment [...] "a waste of good material". Historian William C. Davis, in his volume on the formation of the Confederate government, notes, [...] "For some there was next to nothing to do, none more so than Benjamin." [...] The role of the attorney general in a Confederacy that did not yet have federal courts or marshals was so minimal that initial layouts for the building housing the government in Montgomery allotted no space <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b>|$|E

500|$|Archibald E. Stevenson, a New York {{attorney}} with ties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> likely a [...] "volunteer spy", testified on January 22, 1919, during the German {{phase of the}} subcommittee's work. He said that anti-war and anti-draft activism during World War I, which he described as [...] "pro-German" [...] activity, had now transformed into propaganda [...] "developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement.". [...] The United States' wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that ruled Russia and threatened America anew. [...] "The Bolsheviki movement is {{a branch of the}} revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of Marx and its leaders were Germans." [...] He cited the propaganda efforts of John Reed and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators, [...] "We have found money coming into this country from Russia." [...] Stevenson has been described by historian Regin Schmidt as a [...] "driving force" [...] behind the growth of anti-Bolshevism in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Three emails, out of 30,000, {{were found}} to be marked as classified, {{although}} they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small [...] "c" [...] in parentheses, described as [...] "portion markings" [...] by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not [...] "technically sophisticated" [...] enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it [...] "is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account." [...] Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were [...] "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the FBI would recommend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> that [...] "no charges are appropriate in this case."
