5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E

5|$|Also {{gone from}} the film are the flashbacks to Lecter's childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944.

5|$|Before {{custodial}} interrogations, {{police are}} required to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their legal rights during interrogation.

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the translation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a connection between}} <b>the</b> defining <b>basis</b> presented by Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson [1] in their geometric setting for quantum GLn and the isomorphism classes of linear quiver representations. More precisely, the positive part of <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> in [1] identifies with <b>the</b> defining <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relevant Ringel-Hall algebra; hence, it is a PBW <b>basis</b> in <b>the</b> sense of quantum groups. This approach extends to q-Schur algebras, yielding a monomial basis property {{with respect to the}} Drinfeld-Jimbo type presentation for the positive (or negative) part of the q-Schur algebra. Finally, the paper establishes an explicit connection between <b>the</b> canonical <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> positive part of quantum GLn and <b>the</b> Kazhdan-Lusztig <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> q-Schur algebras...|$|R
