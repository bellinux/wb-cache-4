5|$|The {{theory that}} the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around {{the idea that a}} bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch over the bridge. However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> London Bridge.|$|E
