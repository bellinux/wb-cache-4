5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Dwyer asked his press {{secretary}} Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny {{to set up}} a news conference for the next day without <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> he was to discuss. Horshock arranged the press conference for 10:30a.m. EST the next day, January 22. The press secretary called dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and told them he did not know its subject.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E

5000|$|In essence, {{the above}} method {{can be seen}} as {{following}} the colloquialism [...] "Tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you're gonna <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> you told 'em" [...] with the first part referring to the introduction, the second part referring to the body, and the third part referring to the conclusion.|$|R
500|$|The Coens {{edited the}} film themselves, as is their custom. [...] "We prefer a {{hands-on}} approach," [...] Joel explained in 1996, [...] "rather than {{sitting next to}} someone and <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> to cut." [...] Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, {{they are required to}} use a pseudonym; [...] "Roderick Jaynes" [...] is credited with editing Barton Fink. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the movie, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were [...] "too conventional".|$|E
500|$|Cheryl L. Gillespie gave Sexual Preference a mixed {{review in}} Family Relations, commending Bell et al. {{for using a}} {{sophisticated}} methodology and trying to avoid [...] "poorly designed measures and biased interpretation of data". Nevertheless, she found their methodology and interpretation of data open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, {{that they did not}} sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they thought they wanted to hear, and that they relegated the fact that respondents who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote. She also suggested that readers might find Sexual Preference boring.|$|E
500|$|Within the Party {{itself an}} effort was also made by pro-Soviet {{elements}} to overthrow Hoxha. In June Politburo member Liri Belishova visited China, {{giving a speech}} on June 6 which, {{in the words of}} Griffith, [...] "could hardly have made her pro-Soviet sympathies clearer," [...] having been full of praise for the Soviet Union, with said praise being omitted when the text was published the day after in the Party newspaper Zëri i Popullit. While in China Belishova made contact with the Soviet embassy there, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> the Chinese had told her without authorization from the Albanian Politburo. Belishova and Koço Tashko, Chairman of the Central Auditing Committee, shared leadership of the pro-Soviet faction. [...] Foreign journalist Harry Hamm was told by Albanian functionaries that [...] "Belishova and Tashko had never made any secret of their pro-Soviet leanings, and that they had maintained their attitude long after the decision had been made to move closer to Peking's general line. Their stubborn attitude was bound to lead to their expulsion from the Party and to their being relieved of all their offices." [...] Tashko, asked to speak on his own behalf, had his text prepared beforehand by the Soviet embassy and, having gotten confused, accidentally read the punctuation mark for a full stop in Russian amid a burst of laughter from those present. Both Belishova and Tashko were expelled from the Party in September.|$|E

2500|$|Abdul was {{discovered}} by The Jacksons, after {{a few of the}} band members had watched her while attending a Los Angeles Lakers game. She was signed to do the choreography for the video to their single [...] "Torture". [...] "My only problem was how to tell the Jacksons how to dance," [...] Abdul later recalled. [...] "Imagine me <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> routines to do. I was young, I was scared. I'm not quite sure how I got through that." [...] The success of the choreography in the video led to Abdul's career of choreographer in music videos.

2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could do, in my opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E

2500|$|LaVey {{believed}} that the ideal Satanist should be individualistic and non-conformist, rejecting {{what he called the}} [...] "colorless existence" [...] that mainstream society sought to impose on those living within it. He praised the human ego for encouraging an individual's pride, self-respect, and self-realization and accordingly believed in satisfying the ego's desires. He expressed the view that self-indulgence was a desirable trait, and that hate and aggression were not wrong or undesirable emotions but that they were necessary and advantageous for survival. Accordingly, he praised the Seven Deadly Sins as virtues which were beneficial for the individual. The anthropologist Jean La Fontaine highlighted an article that appeared in The Black Flame, in which one writer described [...] "a true Satanic society" [...] as one in which the population consists of [...] "free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity 'protecting' them or <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they can and cannot do." ...|$|E
