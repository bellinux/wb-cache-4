40|$|For {{nearly a}} century, most {{persons who have}} studied or written about {{property}} have conceived of it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bundle</b> of rights or, colloquially, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bundle</b> of sticks. In the mid 1990 s, several philosophically minded academic lawyers questioned whether property should be thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bundle</b> at all. The impact of their work is reflected in Merrill and Smith (2007), a highly regarded and intellectually challenging casebook used in many U. S. law schools. Merrill and Smith emphasize that property is centrally a right to exclude and is generally held _in rem_, that is, is good against all the world. They find bundle theories of property defective for various reasons. This essay argues to the contrary. There are solid grounds for holding on to at least some bundle theories, which facilitate the careful analysis {{of the complexity of}} property. Moreover, Merrill and Smith's criticisms are often misguided or ineffective. Lastly, their account gives an overly simple picture of property and views property law <b>as</b> <b>a</b> more unified subject than it actually is.
