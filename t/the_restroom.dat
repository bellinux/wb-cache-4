When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take.

5000|$|The piers were {{designed}} to accommodate public <b>restrooms.</b> <b>The</b> deck widens at the piers to provide room for the stairways - {{one on each side}} of the deck - that once descended to <b>the</b> <b>restrooms.</b> Repeated vandalism led to the closure of <b>the</b> <b>restrooms</b> in 1937, and the stairway entrances were covered over with concrete. Windows for [...] "observation balconies" [...] that were originally included in the piers, at the tops on both sides, were also sealed in concrete after closure.|$|R

5|$|Xander's dream {{begins when}} he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself to use <b>the</b> <b>restroom,</b> {{he finds himself}} the object of an {{attempted}} seduction by Joyce. In <b>the</b> <b>restroom,</b> he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants to move into <b>the</b> <b>restroom.</b> A house that was full of people floated {{about half a mile}} (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E

5|$|In a rare change, Milligan's run on {{the title}} starts with John living in {{domestic}} bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over {{the course of the}} first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers' strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India {{to try to find a}} way of saving her. Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in <b>the</b> <b>restroom.</b> The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of <b>the</b> <b>restroom,</b> and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> door opens.|$|E
25|$|The narrator (Phil Rice) {{states that}} {{increased}} cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules {{regarding the use}} of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes <b>the</b> <b>restroom.</b> Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.|$|E

25|$|To {{help reduce}} water usage when restrooms are closed, some restrooms with timed {{flushing}} use an electric water valve connected to <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> light switch. When {{the building is}} in active use {{during the day and}} the lights are on, the timed flush operates normally. At night when the building is closed, the lights are turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|E
25|$|Various {{coaches are}} {{equipped}} with electronic doors for use on the Old Colony Lines and Greenbush Line, which have full-length high-level platforms at all stops. All BTC-3, CTC-3, BTC-4C, and BTC-4D coaches have restrooms. Trains usually {{have one of these}} cars adjacent to the locomotive, as that car will be platformed at all high level platforms regardless of length, and thus handicapped riders will be able to access <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> car.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{treating}} the mental aspect of paruresis, such treatment {{can be achieved}} by graduated exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In graduated exposure therapy, the subject has a trusted person stand outside <b>the</b> <b>restroom</b> at first, and once the fear is overcome the observer is brought closer in, until step by step the phobia is vanquished. The International Paruresis Association provides a detailed discussion of this method on its website.|$|E

25|$|The Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes {{the annual}} Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where {{thousands}} of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute.

In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{reason for this}} difference in design principles between American and European carbuilding practice could be the average distance between stations on the two continents. While most European railroads connected towns and villages that were still very closely spaced, American railroads had to travel over much greater distances to reach their destinations. Building passenger cars with a long passageway through {{the length of the}} car allowed the passengers easy access to <b>the</b> <b>restroom,</b> among other things, on longer journeys.|$|E
25|$|A {{student will}} begin the test after {{instructions}} scripted by the Texas Education Agency are read aloud by the proctor/Test Administrator.
