5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community</b> had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles {{held by the}} ruling political regime. The imperial era was dominated by the social paradigm of Confucianism, which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the Orient. Confucian ideals emphasized morality, character, social relationship, and the status quo. Confucius preached jen (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community</b> in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death {{marked the beginning of}} the current communist administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals. Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of modernization.|$|E

The educational network is comprehensive with lessons from all content areas, videos, resources, webinars, and multiple prospects to network with others. After researching and experiencing the ePals website for the past year, three key elements emerge: process, patience, and persistence. This workshop will demonstrate that technology can foster global collaboration both socially and educationally. <b>The</b> ePals <b>Global</b> <b>Community</b> helps to foster cyber citizenship while enhancing learning through an interdisciplinary approach.

25|$|Since 2005, Iran's {{nuclear program}} {{has become the}} subject of {{contention}} with the international community, mainly the United States, following earlier quotes of Iranian leadership favoring {{the use of an}} atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel. Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community.</b> In 2009, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, {{would not be able to}} develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.|$|E

25|$|According to Ahmadiyya thought, {{it is not}} {{essential}} for a caliph {{to be the head}} of a state, rather the spiritual and religious significance of the Caliphate is emphasised. It is above all a spiritual office, with the purpose to uphold, strengthen, spread the teachings of Islam and maintain the high spiritual and moral standards within <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community</b> established by Muhammad. If a caliph does happen to bear governmental authority as a head of state, it is incidental and subsidiary in relation to his overall function as a caliph. The caliph is also referred to by Ahmadi Muslims as Amir al-Mu'minin (Leader of the Faithful). The current and fifth caliph is Mirza Masroor Ahmad.|$|E
25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community</b> is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{issues related to}} the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30–36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>community</b> must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.|$|E
