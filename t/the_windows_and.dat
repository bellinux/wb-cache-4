5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the early release of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution {{the senior}} {{branch of the}} Rochefoucauld family regained possession. The château was renovated {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. The work was {{undertaken}} by the La Villéons in the romantic style that accompanied the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added decorations to <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to pour out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
50|$|The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out <b>the</b> <b>Window</b> <b>and</b> Disappeared (Hundraåringen som klev ut genom fönstret och försvann, {{also known}} as The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of <b>the</b> <b>Window</b> <b>and</b> Disappeared (UK) and The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out <b>the</b> <b>Window</b> <b>and</b> Disappeared in <b>the</b> US) is a 2009 comic novel by the Swedish author Jonas Jonasson.|$|R
60|$|After a moment's {{thought he}} gave a sharp tap at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> then shrank {{below the level of}} <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> with both his pistols pointed upwards, he waited. As he expected, in a moment <b>the</b> <b>window</b> darkened, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> figure of a man was seen trying to look out into the darkness. As he leaned against the glass, Rupert {{discharged}} both his pistols into his body, and then, leaping up, dashed in <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> leapt over <b>the</b> man's body into the room.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he heard}} {{something}} tapping at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> pane, <b>and</b> a thin voice said, 'Let me in, and I will help you.' It {{was a white}} dove, which sat outside <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> was pecking at it with its beak. He opened <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dove came in and set to work at once, and picked all the feathers out of the heap with its beak. Before the hour was past the feathers were all nicely arranged: the dove flew out at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> at, <b>the</b> same moment the witch came in at the door.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|New {{music was}} mostly {{recorded}} from Psygnosis's in-house music team, CoLD SToRAGE, for versions released outside the PlayStation. The {{songs of the}} PlayStation, Sega Saturn and <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> Mac versions could also be listened to by inserting the CD into a CD player (and skipping the first track). The soundtrack was also released as an audio CD, though with a different artist and track listing.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} chapel {{were drawn}} up by J.H.Perkins, a local school master, with seating for 2,500. In 1859 a {{colonnade}} {{was added to the}} front of the chapel, with a window and cornice above. This was designed by Staffordshire architect Robert Scrivener. Further alterations were made in 1887, including the extension of the minister's vestry, replacement of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> renewal and restoration of the pews.|$|E
60|$|His {{study was}} on the first floor. A high garden-seat stood {{directly}} beneath <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> acted as a convenient ladder. It was easy to get from this on to the window-ledge. Once there he could open <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest would be plain sailing.|$|R

As Tubbs gave the eldest Rover his fingers Dick hauled him from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{literally}} swung him into the dormitory. Then, as Tubbs landed in a heap on the floor, Sam closed <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> locked it.|$|R

5|$|The Farm House {{was built}} from locally {{produced}} bricks, tiles and timber in the 16th century, {{and served as}} the manorial court until 1925 when the last court was held. Work in the 18th and 19th centuries saw <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> doorways replaced, while an extended kitchen was installed. The kitchen extension was replaced in 1958 {{as part of a}} general refurbishment of the house.|$|E
5|$|The Orange Box is a {{video game}} {{compilation}} for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, OS X and Linux. <b>The</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> Xbox 360 versions were produced and published by Valve Corporation and released on October 10, 2007, as a boxed retail copy. A Windows-only download through Valve's Steam service was released the previous day.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded up all of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> threatened {{to do the same}} to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E
5|$|They {{also agreed}} to fixed limits on how many pop-ups they can {{generate}} on a computer (maximum of 5 per day, 1 per hour), the requirement to provide a mute button for any sound content in the pop-ups {{and be able to}} close <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> provide a hyperlink with toll-free number and email utility, to request stopping the pop-ups under certain conditions. The defendants also promised to clearly label any single-click download or install buttons, and not pre-select these as the default.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E

5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. <b>The</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E

5|$|Deus Ex was {{designed}} as a single player game, and the initial releases of <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> Macintosh versions of the game did not include multiplayer functionality. Support for multiplayer modes was later incorporated through patches. The component includes three game modes: deathmatch, basic team deathmatch, and advanced team deathmatch. Only five maps, based on levels from the single-player portion of the game, were included with the original multiplayer patch, but many user-created maps now exist. The PlayStation 2 release of Deus Ex does not offer a multiplayer mode. In April 2014 it was announced that Gamespy would cease their masterserver services, also affecting Deus Ex. A community-made patch for the multiplayer mode has been created as a response to this.|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic Generations {{began in}} 2008, {{following}} {{the completion of}} Unleashed. Sonic Team sought to re-imagine the most popular aspects of the franchise in high-definition, and developed the title using the Hedgehog Engine. Each location and boss in the game is one previously seen in an earlier entry in the series, with the game including numerous other references to past titles. While Sonic Team was the game's main developer, Devil's Details and Dimps helped develop <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> 3DS versions, respectively. The game was first revealed in an internal Sega document that was leaked in 2009, and was released on November 1, 2011. The Windows version is noted for its active modding scene, where a dedicated community creates new gameplay mechanics, levels, and assets for the game.|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
