5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy {{of the state and the}} Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars. He ridicules the monks as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{her role}} {{alongside}} Tennant and Catherine Tate (Donna Noble) in her 2008 introductory episode, Kingston said, [...] "We just clicked. I've done guest roles on other shows, but rarely have I felt such a warm bond." [...] About working with Kingston, Catherine Tate said, [...] "I'm a huge ER fan. When you hold people in awe, it's almost a disappointment when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> they're utterly normal. But Alex isn't disappointing at all. She's such a lovely person." [...] David Tennant {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "Alex is terrific. When she's telling you stories about hanging out with George Clooney, you know she's pretty cool." ...|$|E
6000|$|But BILL and HAROLD, {{followed}} by LATTER, {{are already in}} the [...] doorway. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> LATTER, stumbling over the [...] waste-paper basket, takes it up to improve its position.|$|E
60|$|Milton, old pupil {{as he was}} (that is to say, {{this was}} his second term), sat beside him and {{indicated}} the seniors as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> among the rest pointed out Radbourn.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> Dr. Bathurst {{explained}} Edmund's circumstances. The honest fellow {{looked a}} little perplexed, but after a moment said, [...] "Well, I'll do what in me lies, sir; but 'tis a long way across." ...|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{selected}} for each surgery based on when <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> the surgeon <b>they</b> chose. All the surgeries were performed by two surgeons at the same practice. Our method of band placement has been described in detail previously (Cottam et al. 2006).|$|R
6000|$|... "How can we fly {{and leave}} the Shepherdess, Otter? Since I have been held down the hole, only two men have visited me from time to time, for they think me helpless. Let us seize these men when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> take their knives, for we are unarmed. Then we can think; also we shall have their keys." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{shut the}} door; {{and the first}} thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to {{anything}} private. They sets down then, and the king says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but, you see, it {{is pretty}} certain that that curtain will not be drawn until <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> they would notice it at once. If we took out a pane in the front window the shutter would prevent our seeing or hearing, and the man would be sure to notice the pane was missing as he walked up from {{the gate to the}} house." ...|$|E
60|$|Edwin, Morcar, and Waltheof trembled {{before a}} genius {{superior}} to their own,--a genius, indeed, {{which had not}} its equal then <b>in</b> Christendom. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> begged grace of the king. They got it. But Edwin's earldom was forfeited, {{and he and his}} brother became, from thenceforth, desperate men.|$|R
6000|$|... "So they will; I did {{not think}} of that. But when they once find that they cannot get out here in the evening, they will go out where <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> we shall have no more trouble with them. I don't know whether they are good to eat?" ...|$|R
50|$|Cyclops; <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> small <b>and</b> large sizes, {{and attack}} using flaming rocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{way with}} them always. They do all our work for us,--sailing either on one tack or the other. That is their use in creation, that when we split among ourselves, as we always do, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> finish our job for us. It must be {{unpleasant}} {{for them to be}} always doing that which they always say should never be done at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{can be done}} tonight," [...] Philip said {{to some of the}} men. [...] "The cattle {{will come}} to no harm and, as the boys cannot keep them from {{breaking}} down the shrubs, they had best leave them alone, or they will run the risk of getting hurt. The boys will do more good by taking charge of the more valuable horses, as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> fastening them up to the rings round the wall here. The cart horses must go in with the cattle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Rogner," [...] {{he said to}} one of {{the group}} of {{officers}} behind him, [...] "you will please ride down and meet the cavalry, when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> convey to Lieutenant Drummond my highest satisfaction at the gallant manner in which he has carried out my orders. You will also inform General Gorlitz that, in my opinion, he pushed his reconnaissance much too far; but that I am well content with the bravery shown by the troops, and at the manner in which he drew them off on receipt of my order." ...|$|E
50|$|An event which foreshadowed KLIF's {{future success}} in the news/talk format was the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. KLIF News was always quick to report news bulletins when <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> this resulted <b>in</b> the station {{being one of the}} first media outlets on the air with reports of the shooting.|$|R
30|$|The {{old system}} was non-transparent. People did not {{understand}} its rules and did not care about their own participation in the system (see next sections). The system did not know people until the moment <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> claimed a benefit. Contributions were increasing very rapidly, contributing to growing tax distortions {{on one hand and}} growing labour costs and/or declining net remunerations on the other.|$|R
2500|$|Three of {{the tracks}} {{featured}} backing vocals by the Coconuts, of Kid Creole <b>and</b> the Coconuts. <b>In</b> the words of Steve Lillywhite, [...] "they {{just happened to be}} in Dublin on tour, so we hung out with them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> sang on 'Surrender'. So it was sort of random â€“ this serious Irish rock band having the Coconuts on their album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, sure! All I {{want is to}} get {{the thing}} into the papers. It doesn't matter to me if it turns out later that there was a mistake and that you weren't a burglar trying for my jewels after all. It makes just as good a story either way. I can't think why that never struck me before. Here have I been kicking because you weren't a real burglar, when it doesn't amount to a hill of beans whether you are or not. All I've got to do is to rush out and yell and rouse the hotel, and <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> pinch you, and I give the story to the papers, and everything's fine!" ...|$|E
60|$|At a quadrille party, the bashful young gentleman always {{remains as}} near the {{entrance}} of the room as possible, from which position he smiles at the people he knows as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes steps forward to shake hands with more intimate friends: a process which on each repetition seems to turn him a deeper scarlet than before. He declines dancing the first set or two, observing, in a faint voice, that he would rather wait a little; but at length is absolutely compelled to allow himself to be introduced to a partner, when he is led, in a great heat and blushing furiously, across the room to a spot where half-a-dozen unknown ladies are congregated together.|$|E
60|$|These encomiums {{bring them}} to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed's house. The door is opened by the {{perennial}} Judy, who, having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour, but indeed with a malignant sneer, leaves them standing there while she consults the oracle as to their admission. The oracle may be inferred to give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips that they can come in {{if they want to}} it. Thus privileged, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair {{as if it were a}} paper foot-bath and Mrs. Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{buys the}} fish off the boats as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> I can {{understand}} that he gets them far more cheaply than if he waited till they were hawked in the streets. He is great at omelets and, when he has a chance, he is ashore before the countrywomen come into the market; and will buy the whole stock of eggs, a pound or two of butter, and three or four couples of fowls from one woman, who is glad to sell cheaply and so be free to return home at once. At Bordeaux he lays in a stock of snipe and other birds from the sand hills and marshes, oysters, and other such matters. He is a great favourite with the crew and, in cold weather or stormy nights, there is always hot soup ready for them.|$|E
6000|$|I am kept quite busy at Laurette et Cie., thank goodness. (Not being a French scholar like you--do you {{remember}} Jules?--I {{thought at first}} that Cie {{was the name of}} the junior partner, and looked forward to meeting him.

I hold down the female equivalent of your job at the Fillmore Nicholas Theatrical Enterprises Ltd.--that is to say, I'm a sort of right-hand woman.

[...] (which is usually a black lie) and pass them on to the staff, who do the actual work. I shouldn't mind going on like this for the next few years, but Mr. Faucitt is determined to sell. I don't know if you are like that, but every other Englishman I've ever met seems to have an ambition to own a house and lot in Loamshire or Hants or Salop or somewhere.

6000|$|The {{heart of}} Jamalpur is the [...] "shops," [...] and here a visitor {{will see more}} things in an hour than he can {{understand}} in a year. Steam Street very appropriately leads to the forty or fifty acres that the [...] "shops" [...] cover, and to the busy silence of the loco. superintendent's office, where, a man must put down his name and his business on {{a slip of paper}} before he can penetrate into the Temple of Vulcan. About three thousand five hundred men are in the [...] "shops," [...] and, ten minutes after the day's work has begun, the assistant superintendent knows exactly how many are [...] "in." [...] The heads of departments--silent, heavy-handed men, captains of five hundred or more--have their names fairly printed on a board which is exactly like a pool-marker. They [...] "star a life" [...] when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> their few names alone represent salaries to the extent of six thousand a month. They are men worth hearing deferentially. They hail from Manchester and the Clyde, and the great ironworks of the North: pleasant as cold water in a thirsty land is it to hear again the full Northumbrian burr or the long-drawn Yorkshire [...] "aye." [...] Under their great gravity of demeanour--a man {{who is in charge of}} a few lakhs' worth of plant cannot afford to be riotously mirthful--lurks melody and humour. They can sing like north-countrymen, and in their hours of ease go back to the speech of the Iron countries they have left behind, when [...] "Ab o' th' yate" [...] and all [...] "Ben Briarly's" [...] shrewd wit shakes the warm air of Bengal with deep-chested laughter. Hear [...] "Ruglan' Toon," [...] with a chorus as true as the fall of trip-hammers, and fancy that you are back again in the smoky, rattling, ringing North! ...|$|E

She says she wants to go and live in Altruria, and {{if you would like to}} take home a cook, or a servant of any kind, you wouldn't have much trouble. Now here," [...] she ran on, without a moment's pause, while she flung open another door, [...] "is what you won't find in every apartment-house, even very good ones, and that's a back elevator. Sometimes there are only stairs, and they make the poor things climb the whole way up from the basement, when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> all your marketing has to be brought up that way, too; sometimes they send it up on a kind of dumb-waiter, in the cheap places, and you give your orders to the market-men down below through a speaking-tube. But here we have none of that bother, and this elevator is for the kitchen and housekeeping part of the flat. The grocer's and the butcher's man, and anybody who has packages for you, or trunks, or that sort of thing, use it, and, of course, it's for the servants, and they appreciate not having to walk up as much as anybody." ...|$|E
