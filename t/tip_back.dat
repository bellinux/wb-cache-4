60|$|Carley smiled her thanks, and, {{taking to}} the trail, she stepped out briskly, now giving {{attention}} to her surroundings. The canyon had widened, and the creek with its deep thicket of green and white had sheered to the left. On her right the canyon wall appeared to be lifting higher--and higher. She could not see it well, owing to intervening treetops. The trail led her through a grove of maples and sycamores, out into an open park-like bench that turned to the right toward the cliff. Suddenly Carley saw {{a break in the}} red wall. It was the intersecting canyon, West Fork. What a narrow red-walled gateway! Huge pine trees spread wide gnarled branches over her head. The wind made soft rush in their tops, sending the brown needles lightly on the air. Carley turned the bulging corner, to be halted by a magnificent spectacle. It seemed a mountain wall loomed over her. It was the western side of this canyon, so lofty that Carley had to <b>tip</b> <b>back</b> her head to see the top. She swept her astonished gaze down the face of this tremendous red mountain wall and then slowly swept it upward again. This phenomenon of a cliff seemed beyond the comprehension of her sight. It looked a mile high. The few trees along its bold rampart resembled short spear-pointed bushes outlined against the steel gray of sky. Ledges, caves, seams, cracks, fissures, beetling red brows, yellow crumbling crags, benches of green growths and niches choked with brush, and bold points where single lonely pine trees grew perilously, and blank walls a thousand feet across their shadowed faces--these features gradually took shape in Carley's confused sight, until the colossal mountain front stood up before her in all its strange, wild, magnificent ruggedness and beauty.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem is}} that human {{interference}} can cause the limestone to be damaged or eroded. In a particular case in 1984, a group of vandals broke into the show cave before it was {{opened to the public}} and threw stones at some of the calcite formations around the entrance. Many small stalactites were snapped off at their bases, while the tip of the largest stalactite in the show cave (over 2 m in length) was broken off. This tip fell onto a sandbank on the cave floor where it was retrieved the next day by a workman. It was then sent to the Ulster Museum in Belfast where a calcite resin was specially produced and subsequently used to stick the <b>tip</b> <b>back</b> onto its original position.|$|E

5000|$|Jack Snow, Melody Grandy, and Scott Andrew Hutchins {{have all}} made {{divergent}} attempts to bring <b>Tip</b> <b>back</b> alongside Ozma.

40|$|AbstractFlagellar axonemes {{assemble}} and continuously {{turn over}} at the flagellar tip. The supply and removal of axonemal subunits at the tip are mediated by intraflagellar transport (IFT) [1, 2], a motility process essential for the assembly and maintenance of all eukaryotic flagella and cilia. IFT {{is characterized by the}} movement of large protein complexes (IFT particles) from the basal bodies to the flagellar tip by kinesin-II and from the <b>tip</b> <b>back</b> to the basal bodies by cytoplasmic dynein 1 b. The IFT particles consist of ∼ 16 polypeptides partitioned into two complexes, A and B [2, 3], and associate with axonemal precursors/turn over products. The mechanisms by which IFT motor regulation and cargo loading/unloading occur at the flagellar tip are unknown. We identified a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ortholog of the microtubule (MT) plus end-tracking protein EB 1 [4] (CrEB 1) and show here that CrEB 1 localizes to the tip of flagella and to the proximal part of the basal bodies. Furthermore, we found that CrEB 1 is depleted from flagella of the temperature-sensitive (ts) flagellar assembly-defective (fla) mutant fla 11 ts at the restrictive temperature. This depletion of CrEB 1 is accompanied by a dramatic accumulation of IFT particle polypeptides near the flagellar tip...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIntraflagellar {{transport}} (IFT) is a motility process operating {{between the}} ciliary/flagellar (interchangeable terms) membrane and the microtubular axoneme of motile and sensory cilia. Multipolypeptide IFT particles, composed of complexes A and B, carry flagellar precursors to their assembly site at the flagellar tip (anterograde) powered by kinesin, and turnover {{products from the}} <b>tip</b> <b>back</b> to the cytoplasm (retrograde) driven by cytoplasmic dynein. IFT {{is essential for the}} assembly and maintenance of almost all eukaryotic cilia and flagella, and mutations affecting either the IFT motors or the IFT particle polypeptides result in the inability to assemble normal flagella or in defects in the sensory functions of cilia. ResultsWe found that the IFT complex B polypeptide, IFT 27, is a Rab-like small G protein. Reduction of the level of IFT 27 by RNA interference reduces the levels of other complex A and B proteins, suggesting that this protein is instrumental in maintaining the stability of both IFT complexes. Furthermore, in addition to its role in flagellar assembly, IFT 27 is unique among IFT polypeptides in that its partial knockdown results in defects in cytokinesis and elongation of the cell cycle and a more complete knockdown is lethal. ConclusionIFT 27, a small G protein, is {{one of a growing number}} of flagellar proteins that are now known to have a role in cell-cycle control...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effect of altering serotonin and noradrenaline levels on monosodium glutamate (MSG) taste recognition thresholds in humans. We have previously shown that manipulation of these neurotransmitters lowers taste thresholds of specific taste modalities (Heath et al 2006). A preliminary tongue map for MSG taste was generated in 34 healthy adults (6 male, 28 female, age range 19 - 71) to determine the most sensitive area of the tongue for further testing. In a further 26 adults (13 male, 13 female, age range 19 - 48) a series of MSG and sodium chloride solutions were presented either to the back or the tip of the tongue in a pseudorandom order. Recognition thresholds were calculated from psychophysical function curves before and 2 hours after a single acute dose of either paroxetine (serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor), reboxetine (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), caffeine (active placebo) or placebo (lactose) in a double blind cross-over design. MSG taste recognition thresholds were significantly lower {{at the back of the}} tongue compared to the <b>tip</b> (<b>back</b> 14 ± 3 mM, tip, 60 ± 13 mM, p< 0. 01). Comparison of thresholds at either the back or the tip of the tongue showed MSG recognition thresholds were not affected by any drug, or by placebo, in either region. Sodium chloride thresholds were also unaffected by any intervention, as previously shown. Thus, pharmacological modulation of serotonin or noradrenaline levels in humans has no effect on glutamate taste. These findings, together with our previous study showing that the same interventions modulate bitter and sweet taste, support a modality specific neuromodulatory role for serotonin and noradrenaline in human taste perception...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{assembly}} {{and maintenance of}} eukaryotic cilia and flagella are mediated by intraflagellar transport (IFT), a bidirectional microtubule (MT) -based transport system. The IFT system consists of anterograde (kinesin- 2) and retrograde (cDynein 1 b) motor complexes and IFT particles comprising two complexes, A and B. In the current model for IFT, kinesin- 2 carries cDynein 1 b, IFT particles, and axonemal precursors from the flagellar base to the tip, and cDynein 1 b transports kinesin- 2, IFT particles, and axonemal turnover products from the <b>tip</b> <b>back</b> to the base. Most {{of the components of}} the IFT system have been identified and characterized, but the mechanisms by which these different components are coordinated and regulated at the flagellar base and tip are unclear. ResultsUsing a variety of Chlamydomonas mutants, we confirm that cDynein 1 b requires kinesin- 2 for transport toward the tip and show that during retrograde IFT, kinesin- 2 can exit the flagella independent of the cDynein 1 b light intermediate chain (LIC) and IFT particles. Furthermore, using biochemical approaches, we find that IFT complex B can associate with cDynein 1 b independent of complex A and cDynein 1 b LIC. Finally, using electron microscopy, we show that the IFT tip turnaround point most likely is localized distal to the plus end of the outer-doublet B MTs. ConclusionOur results support a model for IFT in which tip turnaround involves (1) dissociation of IFT complexes A and B and release of inactive cDynein 1 b from complex B, (2) binding of complex A to active cDynein 1 b, and (3) reassociation of complex B with A prior to retrograde IFT...|$|E
