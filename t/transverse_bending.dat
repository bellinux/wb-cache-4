50|$|Because {{both the}} arch and the tie are mainly subject to axial forces, their cross {{sections}} {{can be very}} small. Usually, <b>transverse</b> <b>bending</b> in the deck is bigger than bending in longitudinal direction. Therefore, a concrete deck that spans between the arches is a good solution for bridges with arch distances that are not too large. The concrete deck has longitudinal prestressing tendons in the arch planes.|$|E
50|$|The semi-parabolic {{bridge is}} made of {{crucible}} steel and consists of riveted connections, stretched over the river bed in a slightly oblique position. The two parallel truss beams are divided by eleven vertical poles and rest on supports made from natural stone. The floor of the bridge, in which the former tram rails lie, is now asphalted. Only the three inner fields of the trusses are reinforced by cross-shaped struts, while the others fields have simple struts between {{the upper and lower}} straps. In course of an extension to the tram connection, the upper straps were reinforced by <b>transverse</b> <b>bends</b> to stabilize the construction.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate and compare the impact strength and transverse strength of the high-impact denture base materials. A conventional heat polymerized acrylic resin {{was used as a}} control. Materials and Methods: The entire experiment was divided into four main groups with twenty specimens each according to denture base material selected Trevalon, Trevalon Hi, DPI Tuff and Metrocryl Hi. These groups were further subgrouped into the two parameters selected, impact strength and flexural strength with ten specimens each. These specimens were then subjected to <b>transverse</b> <b>bend</b> tests with the help of Lloyds instrument using a three point bend principle. Impact tests were undertaken using an Izod-Charpy digital impact tester. Results: This study was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance using Fisher f-test and Bonferroni t-test. There was a significant improvement in the impact strength of high-impact denture base resins as compared to control (Trevalon). However, in terms of <b>transverse</b> <b>bend</b> tests, only DPI Tuff showed higher transverse strength in comparison to control. Trevalon Hi and Metrocryl Hi showed a decrease in transverse strength. Conclusions: Within the limits of this in vitro study, (1) There is a definite increase in impact strength due to the incorporation of butadiene styrene rubber in this high strength denture base materials as compared to Trevalon used as a control. (2) Further investigations are required to prevent the unduly decrease of transverse strength. (3) It was the limitation of the study that the exact composition of the high-impact resins was not disclosed by the manufacturer that would have helped in better understanding of their behavior...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{research}} by the authors has revealed the presence of shear horizontal-type of feature-guided (SHB) waves in plates with 90 ˚ <b>transverse</b> <b>bends.</b> The SHB mode is non-dispersive and has low attenuation over a range of higher frequencies (500 kHz – 1 MHz). This mode is attractive for Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) of bends in practical structures such as aerospace spar joints. Here {{the interaction of the}} SHB mode with transverse small-width notches (cracks) running across bends in plates is studied using 3 D finite element simulations and validated by experiments. For through-thickness cracks, the influence of transverse crack length on SHB mode reflection is studied. For part-depth but long cracks (transverse length greater than operating wavelength), influence of crack depth on mode reflection is studied. The results demonstrate the potential of the SHB mode for NDE of bent plate structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a finite element (FE) study on the analysis of reinforced concrete decks in multi-cell box girder bridges under wheel loading. The deck bending moments were investigated for typical multi-cell box girder bridges with various overhang widths and girder spacings. A parametric study related to the tyre pressure distribution showed that a single uniform tyre pressure distribution produces maximum moment effects in reinforced concrete (R/C) decks. The FE analysis showed that the AASHTO LRFD and Standard Specifications methods overestimated the overhang <b>transverse</b> negative <b>bending</b> moments for overhang widths between 105 cm (3. 5 ft) and 165 cm (5. 5 ft) and the <b>transverse</b> positive <b>bending</b> moment for girder spacings between 3 m (10 ft) and 4. 2 m (14 ft). It is concluded that the overestimated moments in the bridge specifications are due to the specified effective width. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Corrosion-resistant alloys {{based on}} the Ni-Cr-Mo system are used in {{demanding}} applications in chemical process, pollution control, and other in-dustries. The ability to make sound welds in these alloys with adequate corrosion re-sistance is critical for their use in most ap-plications. Varestraint weldability testing was carried out on a Ni-Cr-Mo-Cu alloy, HASTELLOY ® C- 2000 ® (UNS N 06200). Mechanical testing was conducted on weldments. Immersion corrosion tests were performed on all-weld-metal coupons of C- 2000 alloy in various envi-ronments, including hydrochloric, hydro-fluoric, and sulfuric acids, with other Ni-Cr-Mo alloys included for comparison. The resistance of C- 2000 alloy to solidifi-cation cracking was similar to other Ni-Cr-Mo alloys that {{are considered to be}} quite weldable, including C- 22 ® and C- 276. Alloy C- 2000 differs from other modern Ni-Cr-Mo alloys in that it contains 1. 6 wt- % copper. Copper does not have a detrimental effect on the resistance of the alloy to solidification cracking.

40|$|The planar <b>transverse</b> <b>bending</b> {{behavior}} of a uniform cantilevered beam with rigid tip body subject to constant axial base acceleration was analyzed. The beam is inextensible and capable of small elastic <b>transverse</b> <b>bending</b> deformations only. Two classes of tip bodies are recognized: (1) mass centers located along the beam tip tangent line; and (2) mass centers with arbitrary offset towards the beam attachment point. The steady state response is studied for the beam end condition cases: free, tip mass, tip body with restricted mass center offset, and tip body with arbitrary mass center offset. The first three cases constitute classical Euler buckling problems, and the characteristic equation for the critical loads/accelerations are determined. For the last case a unique steady state solution exists. The free vibration response is examined for the two classes of tip body. The characteristic equation, eigenfunctions and their orthogonality properties are obtained for the case of restricted mass center offset. The vibration problem is nonhomogeneous for the case of arbitrary mass center offset. The exact solution is obtained as a sum of the steady state solution and a superposition of simple harmonic motions...|$|E
