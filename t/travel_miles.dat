25|$|Broadcast 11 January 1995, {{the first}} episode looks at how plants are able to move. The bramble is an {{aggressive}} example: it advances forcefully {{from side to side}} and, once settled on its course, there is little that can stand in its way. An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant, which inhabits Californian sand dunes. When its location becomes exposed, it shifts at great speed to another one with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds. While not a plant, the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion. One of the most successful (and intricate) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion, whose seeds travel with the aid of 'parachutes'. They are needed to <b>travel</b> <b>miles</b> away from their parents, who are too densely packed to allow any new arrivals. Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further, and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard. The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems, and the liana-species Alsomitra macrocarpa is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic 'gliders'. Some, such as those of the sycamore, take the form of 'helicopters', while others, such as the squirting cucumber release their seeds by 'exploding'. Water is also a widely used method of propulsion. The tropical sea bean Entada gigas has one of the biggest fruits of all plants and is dispersed by water streams. However, most plants use living couriers, whether they be dogs, humans and other primates, ants or birds, etc., and to that end, they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that cockroaches are serious vectors of disease. Cockroaches are not vagile, i.e. they do not travel far from their birthplace {{as opposed to the}} housefly which may <b>travel</b> <b>miles</b> from its birthplace. The cockroach will spread its GI tract contents throughout a building. If that is a home it will be helping to spread the diseases that the family and friends bring into the home. [...] In a hospital or a restaurant it can spread diseases from sick to well individuals. [...] They have no bite or sting. [...] It is true that by external contact that cockroaches can carry bacteria such as salmonella onto surfaces. Their shells contain a protein, arylphorin, implicated in asthma and other respiratory conditions.|$|E
2500|$|As Ocean Grove drew {{more and}} more visitors, the second {{tabernacle}} was also outgrown, and construction of the present Great Auditorium was completed in 1894. [...] Originally designed to accommodate crowds {{of as many as}} 10,000people, the subsequent installation of theater-style cushioned seating in many sections reduced seating capacity to 6,250. It remains Ocean Grove's most prominent structure and the centerpiece of its summer programs (see more about the Auditorium further down the page). By the early 20thcentury, said The New York Times in 1986, it was called the [...] "Queen of Religious Resorts ... Visitors would <b>travel</b> <b>miles</b> to bask in the Victorian seaside splendor and to attend engaging, extroverted religious ceremonies. Millions of people, tourists and pilgrims both, made the trip to Ocean Grove every summer." [...] The social disillusionment around 1920 following World War I {{had a profound effect on}} Ocean Grove and church going in general. [...] There was a decline in interest in camp meeting type activities and there was little in the way of new construction in the town after this time. [...] One result was that Ocean Grove became a time capsule of late Victorian and early 20th century architecture.|$|E

60|$|This work took up my time so completely, and entailed upon me {{so great}} {{an amount of}} writing, that I was in fact unable to do any {{literary}} work. From day to day I thought of it, still purporting to make another effort, and often turning over in my head some fragment of a plot which had occurred to me. But the day did not come in which I could sit down with my pen and paper and begin another novel. For, after all, what could it be but a novel? The play had failed more absolutely than the novels, for the novels had attained the honour of print. The cause of this pressure of official work lay, not in {{the demands of the}} General Post Office, which more than once expressed itself as astonished by my celerity, but in the necessity which was incumbent on me to <b>travel</b> <b>miles</b> enough to pay for my horses, and upon the amount of correspondence, returns, figures, and reports which such an amount of daily travelling brought with it. I may boast that the work was done very quickly and very thoroughly,--with no fault but an over-eagerness to extend postal arrangements far and wide.|$|E

50|$|The {{parameters}} that labeling programs seek {{to expose}} about agricultural systems are <b>travel</b> <b>miles,</b> sustainable feed and organic production, and food system localization. These promotional parameters seek to encourage economic activity for reduced emissions through travel, reduced pesticide use, {{and the need}} to account for resources in a local manner. Humans within the agricultural ecosystem are the nth degree consumers and are have the ability to make dietary decisions. As omnivores humans have the option to be primary or any successive degree consumers. By consuming plants instead of meat, humans can prevent pollution and other environmental impacts. This cause has prompted diets such as environmental vegetarianism.|$|E

[...] One [...] "nzhika" [...] is roughly one mile.

Sure enough it was a tough task.|$|E
50|$|Bark beetles are {{so named}} because they {{reproduce}} in the inner bark, living and dead phloem tissues, of trees. Adult beetles hibernate in forest litter and host trees when environmental conditions are not favorable for reproduction. When conditions are right, they <b>travel</b> <b>miles</b> {{in search of a}} vulnerable host. Once the host is located, the adult burrows through the weakened bark in order to build tunnels where they can mate and lay eggs. They release pheromones to attract more individuals to the host tree. Two to five weeks after contamination, they may migrate to another host and repeat the process. Once the larvae hatch, they feed and pupate under the bark. Up to three generations are produced per year.|$|E
