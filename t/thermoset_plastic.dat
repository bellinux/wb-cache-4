50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} rubber mold casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a rubber mold. Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed. The casting material, usually molten metal or liquid <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic,</b> is then poured in through an opening at the top-center of the mold. The filled mold then continues to spin as the metal solidifies or the <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> sets.|$|E

50|$|A key {{step in the}} {{development}} of synthetic plastics was the introduction of a <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> known as Bakelite phenolic in 1910. Within two years, phenolic resin was applied to plywood as a coating varnish. In the early 1930s, phenolics gained importance as adhesive resins.|$|E

50|$|The {{composite}} ‘tub’ of the E10 {{is formed}} of a ‘sandwich’ that comprises a <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> core contained between sheets of carbon fibre.

50|$|Polyisocyanurate, also {{referred}} to as PIR, polyiso, or ISO, is a <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation. Its chemistry is similar to polyurethane (PUR) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol. Catalysts and additives used in PIR formulations also differ from those used in PUR.|$|E

50|$|FR-4 glass epoxy is {{a popular}} and {{versatile}} high-pressure <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> laminate grade with good strength to weight ratios. With near zero water absorption, FR-4 is most commonly used as an electrical insulator possessing considerable mechanical strength. The material is known to retain its high mechanical values and electrical insulating qualities in both dry and humid conditions. These attributes, along with good fabrication characteristics, lend utility to this grade {{for a wide variety}} of electrical and mechanical applications.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> {{compounds}} characterizes this {{molding process}} {{from many of}} the other molding processes. These thermosets can be in either preform or granule shapes. Unlike some of the other processes we find that the materials are usually preheated and measured before molding. This helps to reduce excess flash. Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the plastic. As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an inherent indefinite shelf-life and shorter cycle moulding times are widely used and examples are shown in Ref 3.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> {{polymers}} characterised by rigid, three-dimensional {{structures and}} high molecular weight, {{stay out of}} shape when deformed and undergo permanent or plastic deformation under load, and normally decompose before melting. Thermoset elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release, also decompose before melting. Conventional thermoset plastics or elastomers therefore cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured which implies that thermosets cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material. There are developments however involving thermoset epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks that can be repeatedly reshaped like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also thermoset polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{advantageous}} features of the Type 89 rifle over the Type 64 was the ability to ease the load on the individual soldier {{in relation to the}} amount of ammunition that he could carry. Also, due to the use of aluminum and <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> as opposed to the steel and wood construction of the Type 64 rifle, the speed with which a soldier could react to a threat was increased. The fixed stock version of the rifle contains a storage space covered by a rubberized cap that may be accessed by pulling the cap away from the body for the rifle and rotating it in either direction. Although the typical issue model is equipped with a fixed stock, a small number of the steel tubing folding stock version were produced for AFV crews and paratroopers.|$|E
50|$|While {{some early}} vessels {{were built in}} 1/150 scale, scales have become {{standardized}} with the most common construction scale of 1:144, although 1:96, 1:72 and 1:48 scale modeling groups also do exist. The majority of hulls are constructed from either fiberglass (with penetration windows cut into it), or scratch built with wood ribs. The exteriors of the ship's hulls are sheeted balsa wood, which allows the relatively low velocity cannon projectiles to penetrate them. The penetration is intended to let in water, with the model sinking if the onboard bilge pumps cannot compensate for {{the rate at which}} water enters the hull. Superstructures are often constructed with a combination of lightweight wood, plastic sheets, <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> resins, and corrosion-resistant metals. Smaller vessels such as light cruisers and destroyers often incorporate a less-durable but lighter superstructure in order to maximize the displacement available for weapons systems. After combat, the models typically escape real damage other than that to the balsa skin, and can typically be patched and turned around in 15-30 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic resins are {{of several}} classes. Some are {{manufactured}} by esterification or soaping of organic compounds. Some are <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> {{in which the}} term [...] "resin" [...] is loosely applied to the reactant or product, or both. [...] "Resin" [...] may be applied {{to one of two}} monomers in a copolymer, the other being called a [...] "hardener", as in epoxy resins. For <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> that require only one monomer, the monomer compound is the [...] "resin". For example, liquid methyl methacrylate is often called the [...] "resin" [...] or [...] "casting resin" [...] while in the liquid state, before it polymerizes and [...] "sets". After setting, the resulting PMMA is often renamed acrylic glass, or [...] "acrylic". (This is the same material called Plexiglas and Lucite).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to formulate the pulverized electronic waste (PEW) stream derived from grinding obsolete electronic assemblies and combine this material with thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers into useful, high-value commercial products materials. PEW consists primarily of various <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> materials and glass fibers from the printed wiring boards, along with ceramic pieces from chip carriers and other electronic components. Typically, the thermosetting materials have the same desirable properties as in the original electronic assembly, including relatively high temperature resistance, excellent chemical resistance, and flame retardancy. These properties combine to make PEW an inherently good inert filler material for plastic composites...|$|E
