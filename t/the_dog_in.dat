5|$|Prior to the 1870s, {{the only}} {{requirement}} {{for a dog}} to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book <b>The</b> <b>Dog</b> <b>in</b> Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver {{than that of the}} Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of two sedation protocols {{on the degree of}} lameness <b>in</b> <b>dogs.</b> METHODS: Fifty lame dogs were allocated to one of two sedation protocols. Group ACPM (acepromazine + methadone; n= 25) was sedated with acepromazine and methadone. Group MED (medetomidine antagonised with atipamezole; n= 25) was sedated with medetomidine and reversed with atipamezole. Each dog was evaluated for lameness before and after sedation using videotapes. Four experienced clinicians allocated global lameness scores before and after sedation to each dog using a numerical rating scale. RESULTS: In 80 % of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group ACPM and in 72 % in group MED lameness was not affected by the sedation. In 12 % of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group ACPM and 20 % of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> group MED <b>the</b> observers noticed an increase of lameness of 1 or 2 degrees on a scale of 0 to 10. In 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> both groups lameness decreased with 1 degree. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A possible diagnostic test for investigation of obscure lameness is intra-articular anaesthesia. Sedation is necessary to allow intra-articular injection. This study provided evidence that the effect of sedation with the proposed protocols on the degree of lameness is negligible...|$|R
