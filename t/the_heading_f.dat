40|$|In situ {{observation}} of the aerosol optical properties {{is important to the}} validations of satellite and modeling results; however, the operational measurements can be affected by some objective factors. An experiment study has been performed in order to analyze the error in retrievals of aerosol optical properties from sunphotometer measurements caused by a variety of in situ objective factors. The standard instrument relative error analysis method was used to determine the relative error of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE) under the effects of five factors: spider web inside the collimator (F 1); collimator bending (F 2); dust inside <b>the</b> optical <b>head</b> (<b>F</b> 3); incrustation scale inside <b>the</b> optical <b>head</b> (<b>F</b> 4); and dust and incrustation scale inside <b>the</b> optical <b>head</b> (<b>F</b> 5). <b>The</b> results showed that the five factors caused error for AOD retrieved at 1020, 870, 670 and 440 nm, with the maximum error occurring at 870 nm due to the more sensitive measurement signals. The error ranges of AOD derived from the direct solar measurements in the four bands were − 0. 34 %– 8. 77 %, − 6. 22 %– 9. 68 %, − 0. 05 %– 2. 52 %, − 0. 96 %– 3. 48 % and 5. 42 %– 13. 38 % for F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4 and F 5, respectively. The maximum error occurred under the influence of F 5 with an average error value of 10 %, while the minimum occurred owing to F 3 with an average error value of 1 %. All of the AEs retrieved from the experimental instruments were smaller than that from the reference instrument. The AE error values were 15. 19 %, 25. 57 %, 4. 56 %, 4. 41 % and 8. 83 % for F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4 and F 5, respectively. The average AE retrieval error value was 11. 7 %...|$|R

40|$|It has {{generally}} been believed that the perceived intensity of a gravitational-inertial force depends on both the magnitude and orientation of the force {{with respect to the}} otolith organs, as does the elevator illusion. In this study, we examine the perceived intensity of Gz force and the elevator illusion {{as a function of the}} applied force and the orientation of <b>the</b> subject's <b>head.</b> Methods: Each of 7 male subjects was seated upright in a swinging chair mounted in the Ames 20 -G Human Centrifuge while he set a visual target to his apparent horizon and judged the perceived intensity of Gz forces by cross-modal matches on a hand dynamometer. Plateau Gz levels were 1. 00 1. 25, 1. 50, 2. 00, 2. 25, and 2. 50; a 30 second ramp to plateau was used in all cases, and the duration of exposure at each plateau was 120 seconds. All measures were obtained both with <b>the</b> subject's <b>head</b> erect and pitched forward 30 degrees. Results: Although the elevator illusion changed with head orientation (F(6, 60) = 7. 56; p less than 0. 001) the perceived intensity of Gz was essentially the same for both orientations of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> (<b>F</b> (6, 60) = 0. 61; p greater than 50).

40|$|The spatial {{organization}} of metastable paramyxovirus fusion (F) and attachment glycoprotein hetero-oligomers is largely unknown. To further elucidate the {{organization of}} functional fusion complexes of measles virus (MeV), an archetype of the paramyxovirus family, we subjected central predictions of alternative docking models to experimental testing using three distinct approaches. Carbohydrate shielding through engineered N-glycans indicates close proximity of a membrane-distal, but not membrane-proximal, section of the MeV attachment (H) protein stalk domain to F. Directed mutagenesis of this section identified residues 111, 114, and 118 as modulators of avidity of glycoprotein interactions and determinants of F triggering. Stalk-length variation through deletion or insertion of HR elements at positions flanking this section demonstrates that {{the location of the}} stalk segment containing these residues cannot be altered in functional fusion complexes. In contrast, increasing the distance between <b>the</b> H <b>head</b> domains harboring <b>the</b> receptor binding sites and this section through insertion of structurally rigid α-helical domains with a pitch of up to approximately 75 Å downstream of stalk position 118 partially maintains functionality in transient expression assays and supports efficient growth of recombinant virions. In aggregate, these findings argue against specific protein-protein contacts between <b>the</b> H <b>head</b> and <b>F</b> <b>head</b> domains but instead support a docking model that is characterized by short-range contacts between <b>the</b> prefusion <b>F</b> <b>head</b> and <b>the</b> attachment protein stalk, possibly involving H residues 111, 114, and 118, and extension of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> domain of <b>the</b> attachment protein above prefusion F...|$|R

Whether <b>the</b> null <b>head</b> <b>F</b> inserted in <b>the</b> derivation has unvalued features of number and gender has consequences for the syntactic computation of agreement relations, in which features may be shared. Heterogeneous case distribution in Q-NPs in nominative-accusative case contexts provides evidence that F is a phase head and triggers transfer of its complement. Variable agreement patterns of both attributive adjectival modifiers and adjectival predicates in the presence of GQ are argued here to reflect attempted-but-failed syntactic agreement, which does not lead to ungrammaticality, as some features unvalued in narrow syntax can still be interpreted by morphological realization rules in PF. GQ is shown here to provide evidence that predicative adjectives cannot have their φ-features valued in situ and must be remerged in a position where their φ-probes can initiate Search for matching features. Agreement in the presence of GQ in Polish thus demonstrates that the need of features to be valued drives syntactic movement...|$|R

40|$|The {{pulse-to-pulse}} {{behavior of}} the beams in the SLC linac i s dominated by wakefields which can amplify any other sources of jitter. A strong focusing lattice combined with BNS damping controls the amplitude of oscillations which otherwise would grow exponentially. Measurements of oscillation amplitude along the linac show beam motion that is up to six times larger than that expected from injection jitter. A search f o r possible sources of jitter within the linac uncovered some problems such as structure jitter at 8 to 12 Hz, pump vibrations at 59 Hz and 1 Hz aliasing by the feedback systems. These account for {{only a small fraction}} of the observed jitter which is dominantly white noise. No source has yet been fully identified but possible candidates are dark current in the linac structures (not confirmed by experiment) or subtle correlations in injection jitter. An example would be a correlated x-z jitter with no net offset visible on the beam position monitors at injection.
