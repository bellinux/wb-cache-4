500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode, and Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, {{thought it would be a}} good way to inaugurate the final season of the show. Since airing, [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] has received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who enjoyed watching the mistakes made by the actors and their attempts to hide <b>their</b> <b>laughter</b> during the live broadcast.

500|$|Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's filmed {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The critic John Riley, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided [...] "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". [...] The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series Paddington, {{which was based on}} the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on Paddington and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: [...] "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing <b>their</b> <b>laughter</b> with you".|$|E

On Valentine's Day, February 14, Park released a song and music video, [...] "Appetizer", available for free download on SoundCloud, produced by friend and fellow Art of Movement member, Cha Cha Malone. On the first episode of Saturday Night Live Korea, Park garnered attention for his skit parodying the film [...] with Korean actor and host of the episode, Choi Min-soo, and for his ad lib during a skit with Shin Dong-yup and Kim Seul-gie which ended up with the cast trying to hold in <b>their</b> <b>laughter.</b> In mid-February, Mizz Nina's single, [...] "Around the World", which is written by and features Park, and produced by Cha Cha Malone, was played on hitz.fm before public release. The single was officially released on February 25, and had been in the works since Park and Mizz Nina performed at MTV World Stage Live in Malaysia 2012. On February 28, Park received the [...] "Musician of the Year" [...] award at the 2013 Korean Music Awards, and his 2012 album, New Breed, was nominated in the [...] "Best R and Soul album" [...] category.|$|E

2500|$|... "To the unfriendly who, {{not knowing}} them well, {{declared}} that Morgoth must have bred the Orcs {{from such a}} stock the Eldar answered: 'Doubtless Morgoth, since he can make no living thing, bred Orcs from various kinds of Men, but the Drúedain must have escaped his shadow; for <b>their</b> <b>laughter</b> and the laughter of Orcs are as different as the light of Aman from the darkness of Angband.' But some thought, nonetheless, {{that there had been}} a remote kinship, which accounted for their special enmity. Orcs and Drûgs each regarded the other as renegades." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, {{their second}} filmed screenplay, named Porcupines Are Born Without Spines, was released. This {{was the first}} film in a series {{that came to be}} known as [...] "Childhood". Inspired by {{children}} and <b>their</b> <b>laughter,</b> they produced a series of memorable films with similar themes. They were: With Children at the Seaside (1972), Exams at Any Odd Time (1974), Problem with Many Unknown Quantities (1977) and The Porcupines' War (1979). The first three films in this series used a formula of two separate plotlines in a film. All these films found an enormous audience.|$|E
2500|$|Drúedain, or drughu, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} variety of men, lived in very little numbers, often in tribes. They were little folk, shorter than dwarves, yet taller than hobbits. They were known for their voodoo-like magic, their black eyes (which glow red when they are angry), and their ability to sit for hours and days on end without moving or blinking. They grew little hair, except that on their heads and sometimes small tufts on their chins. [...] They were short and stout, and other men tended to dislike them due to their harsh, rough voices. <b>Their</b> <b>laughter,</b> however, was full of mirth. It is said that their skill of stonework rivaled the Dwarves'.|$|E

2500|$|Commodus {{was also}} known for {{fighting}} exotic animals in the arena, often to {{the horror of the}} Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day. Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next. [...] Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and chewed on laurel leaves to conceal <b>their</b> <b>laughter.</b> [...] On another occasion, Commodus killed three elephants {{on the floor of the}} arena by himself. Finally, Commodus killed a giraffe, which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.|$|E

60|$|No, {{they were}} not princesses. <b>Their</b> {{unrestrained}} <b>laughter</b> filling the hot, fern-clad ravine had a soulless limpidity, as of wild, inhuman dwellers in tropical woodlands.
