5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> {{action in the}} form of racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

To this end, in 2011, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice jointly issued , acknowledging the flexibility that school districts have in taking proactive steps to meet the compelling interests of promoting diversity and avoiding racial isolation within the parameters of current law.|$|E
25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E
500|$|Silber and Nesmith, {{who felt}} <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action would lower {{academic}} hiring standards, triggered strife among {{students and faculty}} (including then-dean of students Nancy Richardson) at the School of Theology. Their opponents believed <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action helped increase equality in a system developed by white men. Richardson advocated affirmative action to Nesmith, arguing {{that it would not}} lower academic standards and the school's administration should reexamine its assumptions about race, women and minorities. Richardson was fired in 1981, with Nesmith attributing her termination to [...] "pedagogical and ideological differences" [...] with the administration. Richardson sued, claiming discrimination by Boston University. Heins provides a background of precedent established by prior cases (some of which contradict each other), interspersed with discussions of Supreme Court decisions concerning affirmative action.|$|E

[...] Concluding that the program {{did not meet the}} standard, and must be struck down, Powell's memorandum stated <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action was permissible under some circumstances, and eventually formed much of his released opinion.|$|E
500|$|The case {{fractured}} the court; {{the nine}} justices issued {{a total of}} six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. [...] Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. [...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, [...] "dispositionality" [...] {{has become}} an {{umbrella}} term for an express contract between the teams, generally clarified in 1NC cross-examination. The agreement usually entails a negative commitment to the counterplan provided <b>that</b> the <b>affirmative</b> is willing {{to compare it to}} the affirmative without making any conditional statements. The negative can be conditional if the affirmative begins it (i.e. making a permutation, thus making it conditional in <b>that</b> the <b>affirmative</b> can defend either the plan or permutation). A new form of dispositionality has also been that the negative can kick the counterplan if the affirmative straight turns the counterplan.|$|R

If both premises are universal, i.e. [...] "All" [...] or [...] "No" [...] statements, one school of thought says they do not imply the existence of any members of the terms. In this case, the conclusion cannot be existential; i.e. beginning with [...] "Some". Another school of thought says <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> statements (universal or particular) do imply the subject's existence, but negatives do not. A third school of thought says that the any type of proposition {{may or may not}} involve the subject's existence, and though this may condition the conclusion, it does not affect the form of the syllogism.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{appointment}} to the University of California board of regents in 1993, Connerly began {{to learn more about}} the workings of its affirmative action program. In 1994, he heard from Jerry and Ellan Cook, whose son had been rejected at the University of California, San Francisco (UC) Medical School. [...] Connerly became convinced <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action, as practiced by the UC, was another kind of racial discrimination. Cook, a statistician, had presented data showing that white and Asian students were being denied admission despite having better grades and test scores than other students who were being admitted. Connerly proposed abolishing the controversial racially based programs, while allowing the university to consider social or economic factors. The regents passed the proposal in January 1996 despite protests from activist Jesse Jackson and other supporters of affirmative action. The year after affirmative action was abolished, the number of Asian students admitted to UC increased markedly.|$|E

50|$|There {{is also a}} small {{subset of}} debate theory that asserts that only topical counterplans should be allowed. This theory is often called Plan-Plan and argues <b>that</b> the <b>affirmative</b> should have the burden to prove that its policy is {{the best example of}} the resolution. The {{negative}} should be restricted to offering topical counterplans that provide greater benefits than the plan. This theory rejects traditional formulations of competition and argues <b>that</b> the <b>affirmative</b> should be prepared to attack the counterplan alone in comparison to the plan because it falls within the accepted and predictable wording of the resolution. While this view has some aggressive adherents, it has not been exceptionally popular in most circles.|$|R

2500|$|The Court's {{majority}} ruling, {{authored by}} Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, {{held that the}} United States Constitution [...] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." [...] The Court held that the law school's interest in obtaining a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students was indeed a [...] "tailored use". O'Connor noted that sometime in the future, perhaps twenty-five years hence, racial affirmative action {{would no longer be}} necessary in order to promote diversity. It implied <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> action should not be allowed permanent status and that eventually a [...] "colorblind" [...] policy should be implemented. The opinion read, [...] "race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time." [...] "The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." [...] The phrase [...] "25 years from now" [...] was echoed by Justice Thomas in his dissent. Justice Thomas, writing that the system was [...] "illegal now", concurred with the majority only on the point that he agreed the system would still be illegal 25 years hence.|$|E
