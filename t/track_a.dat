5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double <b>track,</b> <b>a</b> new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna.

Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1966, Hendrix was {{struggling}} {{to earn a living}} playing the R circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

In Cabo San Lucas, 2,100marine workers were set up to start evacuations. In La Paz, classes were suspended. Throughout the peninsula, 164shelters were opened capable of harboring 30,000people, but only 3,500persons used these shelters. At the time of landfall, hotels in the state were at 46%of capacity, equal to 30,000tourists, 26,000of whom were foreigners. The ports of La Paz, Los Cabos, San José del Cabo, and Loreto were closed. Around 800marine officers were placed on standby. Police with megaphones walked through vulnerable areas in Cabo San Lucas urging people to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. <b>Track</b> <b>A,</b> Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had not been a problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E

Bruce and Utsler participated in a three-day photo shoot for the album's promotional images. The album's release was preceded with a nationwide in-store tour beginning in August, and followed by a 64-day tour, including the group's annual Halloween performance in Detroit. The album was released in three different color variations of the cover: red, blue, and green. Each version features its own unique introduction and hidden <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> sampler for the album was released, featuring a decoder piece for finding hidden messages in the album's artwork.|$|E
5|$|The group {{carried out}} their vocal overdubs during the {{afternoon}} of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot says this contribution is inaudible on the completed <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Lysaker and standard gauge traffic {{was carried out}} on the northern <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All–standard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922. An interlocking system was installed on 29 July 1924. From 1922 a half-hour headway was introduced on the local trains between Sandvika and Oslo West Station.|$|E

5|$|The {{northbound}} platform, {{currently a}} side platform, {{can serve as}} an island platform should passenger service return to the NECR track. The 2010 SCCOG report indicated that Amtrak wished Shore Line East to move its operations to Track 6, freeing the mainline tracks for through trains. In 2013, most Shore Line East trains began using Track 6. Most passengers use the low-level section of the platform south of State Street, but a short metal spur on the high-level platform provides handicapped accessible boarding for trains using the <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> low-level section of the northbound platform also remains north of the high-level section; {{it has not been}} used since the high-level section was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the <b>track,</b> <b>a</b> complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E

The original athletics stadium opened in 1953, located {{at the same place}} as the current athletics stadium. Minerva arranged the first tournament on 16 June 1954. Subsequently, a velodrome was installed outside the running <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> municipal grant of 5,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) allowed a steeplechase obstacle to be installed in 1959.

5|$|Around {{the time}} when the NHC began issuing {{advisories}} on the depression, officials issued a tropical storm warning for northern Honduras that eventually covered the country's entire coastline. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the coast of Belize. When the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression, the agency anticipated the depression would intensify into a strong tropical storm, based on low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the agency noted uncertainty in the <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> ridge to the north was expected to steer the nascent depression westward, and two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the storm would continue west-northwestward to strike Belize. Other models forecast a more immediate landfall, which would limit intensification. While the storm was active, officials in Honduras issued a yellow alert for seven departments where heavy rainfall had occurred. A nationwide yellow alert was also issued for El Salvador, meaning there was potential for flooding and landslides, although alerts were dropped on October21 when the threat of rainfall diminished.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear <b>track.</b> <b>A</b> large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
