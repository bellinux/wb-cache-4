25|$|The only class, {{according}} to Engels, which is free from these restraints of property, {{and as a}} result from the danger of moral decay, is the proletariat, as they lack the monetary means that are the basis of (as well as threat to) the bourgeois marriage.

500|$|Another season two episode, [...] "Gnomes", {{revolves}} around {{a group of}} [...] "underpants gnomes" [...] who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> three-step process: Phase 1 is [...] "collect underpants". Phase 3 is [...] "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur {{between the first and}} final steps, and [...] "Phase 2" [...] is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using [...] "????" [...] and [...] "PROFIT!" [...] as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) has become a widely popular Internet meme because of this. Especially in the context of politics and economics, [...] "underpants gnomes" [...] has been used by some commentators to characterize a conspicuous gap of logic or planning.|$|E

Douglas Mawson reported spotting two women aboard a Norwegian ship, who were probably Christensen and Wegger, during his BANZARE expedition. He wired back to the Australian media: [...] "...much astonishment was excited by the dramatic appearance on their decks of two women attired in the modes of civilisation. <b>Theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> unique experience, for they can make much merit {{of the fact that}} they are, perhaps, the first of their sex to visit Antarctica".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, UGC {{issued a}} notice to IIPM after the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education {{questioned}} IIPM on {{the authenticity of}} its courses at its Hyderabad campus. UGC Chairman Ved Prakash said that IIPM was advertising its programs using the names of UGC, HRD Ministry and AICTE, and that [...] "it is indulging in cheating." [...] IIPM Group President for Corporate Affairs Amit Saxena said the institute was not a university, was not empowered to award degrees on its own and was doing neither, and that IIPM was [...] "on-site academic partner of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University which grants its degrees to IIPM students." [...] Saxena also said that IIPM had made representations to UGC and Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education to clarify its position and that the subject was sub judice at the Delhi High Court. The registrar of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University confirmed that IIPM was authorized to offer Manonmaniam Sundaranar University's MBA/BBA programs in all of IIPM's 18 branches. Students of IIPM's Indian School of Business and Economics (ISBE) were informed by Manonmaniam Sundaranar University that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distance-learning degree arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incremental}} research techniques developed at IBM eventually became {{dominant in the}} field after DARPA, in the mid-80s, returned to NLP research and imposed that methodology to participating teams, shared common goals, data, and precise evaluation metrics. The Continuous Speech Recognition Group's research, which required large amounts of data to train the algorithms, {{eventually led to the}} creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium. In the 1980s, although the broader problem of speech recognition remained unsolved, they sought to apply the methods developed to other problems; machine translation and stock value prediction were both seen as options. A group of IBM researchers went on to work for Renaissance Technologies. Jelinek wrote, [...] "The performance of the Renaissance fund is legendary, but I have no idea whether any methods we pioneered at IBM have ever been used. My former colleagues will not tell me: <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very hush-hush operation!" [...] Methods very similar to those developed for achieving speech recognition are at the base of most machine translation systems in use today. Observers have said that Pierce's paradigm, according to which engineering achievements in this area would be built on scientific progress, has been inverted, with the achievements in engineering being at the base of a number of scientific findings.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rev. William Matheson, the eponymous {{ancestors}} of most west highland clans first appear {{in around the}} 13th century. At {{the beginning of the}} 13th century Lewis was under Norse control. The mediaeval manuscript known as the Chronicles of Mann shows that at least one eminent Óláfr had connections with Lewis at this time—Olaf the Black—who would later become King of Man and the Isles. Today the Macaulays of Lewis are generally said to be of Norse descent, and in consequence a favourite modern tradition of <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> descent from Olaf the Black. However, according to Matheson, there is no real evidence for any descendants of Olaf the Black to have lived on Lewis. A tradition of the Macaulays of Uig was that they descended from [...] "Magnus, King of Norway"; the family of the Victorian era historian and politician, Lord Macaulay (also descendants of the Macaulays of Uig) termed him [...] "Olaus Magnus, King of Norway". Matheson was of the opinion that the name Magnus may possibly be significant because Olaf the Black had a son so named. The 19th-century historian, Thomas, wrote that there was no real tradition among the Macaulays of Lewis as to their eponymous ancestor. Thomas maintained that the claim of descent from Olaf, King of Mann was an example of [...] "historical induction": where a historical figure is grafted on to a tradition. Thomas also showed that in the 17th century the belief on Lewis was that the Macaulays descended from an Irishman. Olaf the Black has also been claimed as ancestor of the Macleods and Morrisons of Lewis, as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reality of}} the New South Africa is decidedly violent, and crime is a {{well-known}} theme in post-apartheid Afrikaans protest music. [...] The punk group Fokofpolisiekar (which translates to [...] "fuck off police car") sings in [...] "Brand Suid-Afrika" [...] : [...] "For you knives lie in wait, in the garden outside you house," [...] and Radio Suid-Afrika sings in [...] "Bid" [...] : [...] "Pray that no-one will be waiting in the garden, pray for strength and for mercy in each dark day." [...] <b>Theirs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> country of [...] "murder and child rape" [...] where the only respite is alcohol abuse. [...] In [...] "Blaas hom" [...] by the industrial band Battery9, the narrator sings how he gleefully unloads his gun on a burglar after being robbed for the third time, and in [...] "Siek bliksems" [...] Kristoe Strauss asks God to help against the [...] "sick bastards" [...] responsible for hijackings. The metal band KOBUS! pleads for a reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in [...] "Doodstraf", because they feel the promise of peace has not been realized. In [...] "Reconciliation Day", Koos Kombuis sings: [...] "Our streets run with blood, every day a funeral procession, they steal all our goods, on Reconciliation Day." [...] Elsewhere he states, [...] "we're in a state of war." [...] The video of this song features a lawless microcosm of theft, rape and abuse – a lawlessness reflected in Valiant Swart's [...] "Sodom en Gomorra": [...] "two cities in the north, without laws, without order, too wonderful for words." [...] Hanru Niemand rewrites the traditional Afrikaans song Sarie Marais, turning it into a murder ballad speculating on where Sarie's body will be found. [...] The new protest musicians also parody Voëlvry's music: Johannes Kerkorrel's [...] "Sit dit af" [...] – a satire on P. W. Botha of the apartheid regime – is turned into [...] "Sit dit aan" [...] by Koos Kombuis, now a song protesting mismanagement resulting in chronic power failures.|$|E
