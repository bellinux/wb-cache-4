It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{finished}} second in the medal table, behind host nation China, winning 42 gold medals and 102 total medals, equalling the team's position in the medal <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2004 Athens Games. The number of medals won was an increase on the 94 medals and 35 golds in Athens. The team was the most successful in two decades, with 80 different athletes winning at least one medal. The United Kingdom was the next host of the Summer Paralympics, holding the 2012 Games in London.|$|E

Rovers started the 1991–92 season badly and Bremner tendered his resignation on 2 November, with the club sitting bottom of the Football League.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period.

This led the media to highlight {{the contrast between the}} achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E

Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing the chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara's {{stint as}} Juventus manager, however, {{proved to be}} unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of January 2010, leading to the {{dismissal}} of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the <b>table,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|The Wars of the Roses {{during the}} 15th century saw {{prolonged}} fighting between the Yorkists and Lancastrians {{for the control}} of the English throne. John Howard, a Yorkist supporter, was killed at Bosworth Field in 1485 and in the aftermath his son Thomas, the 2nd Duke, was attainted, forfeiting his and his heirs' rights to his properties and titles, and placed in the Tower of London. The Lancastrian victor at Bosworth, Henry VII, granted Framlingham Castle to John de Vere, but Thomas finally regained the favour of Henry VIII after fighting at the victory of Flodden in 1513. Framlingham was returned to Thomas and the Duke spent his retirement there; he decorated his <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> castle with gold and silver plate that he had seized from the Scots at Flodden. The castle was expensively decorated in a lavish style during this period, including tapestries, velvet and silver chapel fittings and luxury bedlinen. A hundred suits of armour were stored in the castle and over thirty horses kept in the stables.|$|E

5|$|The club had one {{of their}} worst season starts ever; they lost three {{straight}} in the league – reaching a season-worst 17th position after three rounds – and both their European appearances against FC Kuban Krasnodar. Because they only lost two more games {{in the first half}} of the season, they climbed to fourth place in the <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> halfway mark. They won three KNVB Cup games to eventually succumb to the eventual runners-up in the quarter-finals. The team ended the season on a high note with a seven-game winning streak before drawing the last game of the season. This led to a second-place finish in the 2013–14 Eredivisie, a place that qualified Feyenoord for the third qualifying round in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Overall Feyenoord won 23 matches, drew 7 and lost 10 during the season. Graziano Pellè was the season topscorer with 26 goals, of which 23 occurred in the Eredivisie.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} for congregations {{also led to}} changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture. The Church of Scotland {{was among the first}} European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements, abandoning box pews for open benches. From {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century some of its churches, like Greyfriars in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At Duns the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate chancel, communion <b>table</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far end, and the pulpit under the chancel arch. The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at Crathie (opened 1893), which had an apsidal chancel raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass lectern, and St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the <b>table.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E
