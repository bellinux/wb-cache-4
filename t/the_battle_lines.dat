5|$|Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia, {{and was a}} {{prominent}} figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city. Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. Peggy and Arnold married on April 8, 1779. Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines,</b> despite military bans on communication with the enemy. Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} was in place, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put {{under the command of}} Eighth Army's I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and the weather was poor in the region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.|$|E

5|$|It {{was between}} these two groups that, after Elizabeth's death in 1603, a new, more savage episode of the Reformation {{was in the process}} of gestation. During the reigns of the Stuart kings, James I and Charles I, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> were to become more defined, leading {{ultimately}} to the English Civil War, the first on English soil to engulf parts of the civilian population. The war was only partly about religion, but the abolition of prayer book and episcopacy by a Puritan Parliament was an element in the causes of the conflict. As historian MacCulloch has noted, the legacy of these tumultuous events can be recognised, throughout the Commonwealth (1649–60) and the Restoration that followed it, and beyond. This third party was to become the core of the restored Church of England, but at the price for further division.|$|E
5|$|Taking the bait, the {{following}} day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS Caesar, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret {{at a time of}} his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained {{the following}} day with the arrival of Nielly's detached squadron. Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when the haze lifted on 1 June 1794, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> were only 6miles (10km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.|$|E
5|$|The first French {{units to}} come under attack were those {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated from {{one another in the}} citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines.</b> He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population.|$|E

5|$|When Ibn al-Ashtar {{returned}} to his position, he dismounted and the Umayyads advanced. In command of the Umayyad right wing was al-Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, {{in command of the}} left wing was Umayr ibn al-Hubab, while Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l Kala' al-Himyari led the cavalry. Ubayd Allah marched along with his foot soldiers. As <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> became closer, al-Sakuni's right wing assaulted al-Jushami's left wing. Al-Jushami fell, followed by his son Qurrah and their guards. Consequently, Ibn al-Ashtar's left wing was driven back, but under Abdallah ibn Warqa' al-Saluli they collected themselves and joined Ibn al-Ashtar's right wing. Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar directed the right wing under al-Azdi to assault the Umayyads' left wing in the hope that Umayr ibn al-Hubab would hold true to his promise and fall back as agreed. However, Umayr held his ground and fierce fighting ensued.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, <b>The</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>Lines</b> Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E

500|$|Design of Von der Tann {{began in}} August 1906, {{under the name}} [...] "Cruiser F", amid {{disagreements}} over the intended role of the new ship. Admiral Tirpitz advocated a ship similar to the new British battlecruisers of the Invincible class: heavier guns, lighter armor, and higher speed {{with the intention of}} using the ship as a fleet scout and to destroy the opposing fleet's cruisers. Tirpitz had no intention of using the ship in <b>the</b> main <b>battle</b> <b>line.</b> Kaiser Wilhelm II however, along with most of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), was in favor of incorporating the ship into <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>line</b> after initial contact was made, which necessitated much heavier armor. This insistence upon the capability to fight in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>line</b> was a result of the numerical inferiority of the German High Seas fleet compared to the British Royal Navy.|$|R

The US rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. General John J. Pershing, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander, refused to break up US units to serve as mere reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to fight in French divisions.

25|$|Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, {{and modern}} {{artillery}} with fragmentation shells helped bring <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution {{with the creation}} of the tank and mechanised warfare. The British first tanks were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the Renault FT, which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of light automatic weapons and submachine guns, such as the Lewis Gun, the Browning automatic rifle, and the Bergmann MP18.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{opened with}} a cavalry charge by both armies. The Spartan cavalry were quickly {{defeated}} by the superior Theban cavalry and were chased back to their own side. Their disorderly retreat disrupted <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>lines</b> of the Spartan heavy infantry and, because of the resulting chaos and the dust stirred up, the Spartans were unable to observe the highly unusual advance of the Theban army until the very last moment. Epaminondas had ordered his troops to advance diagonally, such that the left wing of the Theban army (with its concentration of forces) would impact with {{the right wing of}} the Spartan army well before the other weaker phalanxes. The furthest right wing of the Theban phalanx was even retreating to make this possible. This is the first recorded instance of the military formation later known as the oblique order. The Theban cavalry also helped by continuing to carry out intermittent attacks along the Spartan battle lines, holding their advance back.|$|E
