40|$|Thesis (MTech (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1999. Although <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is {{well known}} in most South African {{organizations}} it is an aspect that enjoys a low priority in the majority of organisations resulting in weak and insufficient <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The aforementioned together with a lack of sufficient <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> preparation within local authorities often leads to the formation of an incorrect perception when individuals retire. Aspects affecting <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> include the continued high inflation rate, affirmative action, political and economic uncertainty, the population explosion, unemployment and rationalization. It is therefore imperative that officials receive the necessary training and leadership for the expected success of retirement. An important shortcoming exists in this unique field to school and prepare officials and the importance of establishing an independent future after an active career becomes essential. The focus point for this investigation was to determine to what degree <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is operational in local authorities. Secondly, the degree to which available information in connection with <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is used to prepare officials effectively for the process was determined. Subsequently problems experienced with the application and implementation of a <b>retirement</b> <b>plan</b> for officials as well as obstacles that could hinder the process of successful timeous <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> was also looked at...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of women baby boomer retirees in the U. S., the issue of lack of financial security after retirement due to limited resources has begun to draw attention in policy and research areas. However, few {{studies have focused on}} the predictors of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The purpose of this study includes the following: (1) to examine relations between demographic characteristics and attitudes toward retirement and financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> of baby boomer women, and (2) to examine the longitudinal trajectories of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> of baby boomer women, and to identify the roles of demographic characteristics and attitudes toward retirement in predicting those trajectories. It was hypothesized that the rates of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> increase over time, but the rates of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> vary across individuals and time. Specifically, it was hypothesized that demographic variables and attitudes toward retirement relate to the rates of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> across time. This study utilized data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Among 22 waves of the data set, four recent surveys (1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001) were utilized for the current study. Sample sizes of cross-sectional analysis and longitudinal analysis were 2, 146 and 1, 250, respectively. The mean age was 45. 32 (SD = 2. 23, range = 42 - 49) at the first time. The results demonstrated that race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and annual income of baby boomer women were significantly related to their financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> Also, positive attitudes toward retirement were associated with higher rates of financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> Moreover, longitudinal analyses demonstrated that individual changes in marital status and in income level significantly related to financial <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> over time. ^ KEY WORDS: Financial <b>Retirement</b> <b>Planning,</b> Baby Boomer Women, Demographic Characteristic, Attitudes toward Retirement, Longitudinal Study...|$|R

These concerns stem from the expected strain on social security and health systems when this generation leaves the paid workforce. <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> has been identified by social science researchers as one way of protecting pre-retirees’ future well-being, {{but there are many}} problems within this research. For example, the long-term benefits of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> are yet to be confirmed, the causal relationships between socioeconomic, psychological, and demographic variables have been under-theorised, and existing conceptualisations of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> have not adequately captured the construct. This has had implications for the resultant measures and for the development of new <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> knowledge. A programme comprising four studies was designed to address these limitations in the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> research. For Study One, longitudinal data from the American Health and Retirement Survey were used to illustrate the prospective benefits of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> on well-being in later life. For Study Two, a sub-sample of 2, 277 working men and women from the New Zealand Health, Work, and Retirement survey, was used to theorise and model the causal effects of SES, work involvement, and retirement perceptions on <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> from a gendered perspective. Study Three described the development and validation of a comprehensive and theoretically driven measure of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> using a population sample of 1, 449 New Zealand pre-retirees. Fifty two items were developed to assess each stage of the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> process for financial, health, lifestyle, and psychosocial planning. The final study used the same data to examine the relationships between certain psychological, socioeconomic, and demographic variables and the process of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The results indicated that these variables were inconsistently correlated with the different stages III of the planning process. These inconsistencies were theorised as barriers to completing the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> process. Overall, the results of the four studies indicate that <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> predicts well-being and that certain groups are less prepared than others. Conceptualising <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> as a process has the potential to build on our current understandings by generating research questions that have not previously been considered. These new understandings will have implications for future research and for retirement policy aimed at promoting <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> {{for the next generation of}} retirees...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} finances and health {{are the two}} most significant factors associated with retirement decision-making and a successful <b>retirement</b> experience. <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is one mechanism by which individuals prepare for the retirement transition; however, <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> routinely emphasizes financial concerns, often to the exclusion of health or other significant aspects of <b>retirement.</b> <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is an increasingly relevant topic {{at a time when the}} population is aging, company-sponsored pensions and retiree benefits have diminished significantly, and reform is being sought for the long-standing social programs that have provided support for generations of older Americans. From a financial perspective, few would question the positive benefits associated with retirement planning; however, preparing for a healthy retirement is equally important. If a relationship between <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> and health status were to be established, Americans might find increased public and private support for individual <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> efforts, particularly among more vulnerable populations such as minorities and women. This dissertation explores the notion that engagement in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is associated with health status through three studies. Utilizing data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the first article explores prevalence of <b>plans</b> for <b>retirement</b> among worker and retiree respondents, and compares health and other key characteristics associated with planning among the two sub-samples. The second and third articles focus on time order relationships between health status and <b>retirement</b> <b>planning,</b> with article two addressing the question of whether onset of poor health precedes <b>planning</b> for <b>retirement</b> and article three examining health status of planners versus non-planners, over time, to determine whether those who engage in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> are more likely to realize better health outcomes.

40|$|Abstract: Saving for {{retirement}} {{is a central}} concern for governments all over the world. Increasing longevity and {{the rising cost of}} post-retirement medical cover for members who fail to save enough {{for retirement}} becomes the responsibility of the governments. Of greatest concern are individuals who deliberately opt not to plan and save for retirement. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how behavioural factors influence the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> of middle and high income earners in South Africa. A sample of 1 880 pre-retirees earning more than R 16 000 per month was selected from four economic sectors (mining, finance, trade and manufacturing) in South Africa. Online questionnaires were administered to gather data on behavioural factors that influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. The data was statistically analysed to determine the significance of the factors that influence the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour of the respondents. It was found that while some variables (retirement goal clarity and self-rated knowledge of financial planning) had a strong and significant correlation with <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour, future time perspective and potential conflicts to retirement had weak and insignificant relation to <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. Regression analysis was also applied to test the extent to which the observed behavioural factors influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. All six psychological variables (planning activity level, goal clarity, future time perspective, risk tolerance, self-rated knowledge of financial planning and potential conflicts to retirement) were found to influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The regression model explained 62 % of the variability in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour of middle and high income earners in South Africa.
