5000|$|Bread series, {{a series}} of sculptures made of dark linden wood, with hints of gold and bronze on the front. The wood is shaped into a curve and carved on the front in a complex pattern of cavities. The {{drawings}} are made from a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scan</b> of slices of black bread which yields a symmetrical pattern that is carved into the wood by a machine. The wood surface is then treated with acids and gold paint to create an aged look. The Bread series sculptures recall Russian icons (in the wooden materials and the golden sheen), and slices of typical Russian bread. Osmolovsky often put these sculptures in wall compositions, reminding the audience of the typical iconostasis of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2008, he exhibited Bread series sculptures in the solo show New Works at Marat Guelman Gallery, Moscow.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Myopic foveoschisis (MF) is the {{splitting}} of the retinal layers in the fovea, probably {{caused by}} the excessive elongation of the ocular globe in patients with high myopia (HM). The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the morphological and functional characteristics of the retinal area affected by MF. Methods: Five eyes of 10 patients were diagnosed with MF by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Patients were examined using both a nineteen-line raster scan and a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scan</b> during the same visit. All subjects underwent monocular instrumental registration of the visual characteristics of macular areas such as macular thickness, retinal functionality and sensitivity values. The patients and control subjects underwent also multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) and Microperimetry (MP- 1) and the obtained results were compared to show the effects of pathologies of the inner and outer retinal layers. The statistic analysis with nonparametric tests for the examined variables, and in particular the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for paired data, was performed. Results: The two tailed test yielded statistically significant values in the MF group for all three studied characteristics, OCT, mfERG and MP- 1, in both the first and second ring. In the third area between 5 ° and 10 ° the alterations of the values proved to be statistically significant only for macular thickness measured by OCT and amplitude of the P 1 wave shown in the mfERG results. Conclusions: The nineteen-line raster scan and the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scan</b> mode of SD-OCT were useful for the detection of the pathologies that accompany MF, also providing important informations before and after a possible vitreo-retinal surgery. However these informations must be supported by objective and subjective functional tests just as mfERG and MP- 1...|$|E

40|$|This project {{utilised}} <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scanning</b> {{technology in}} the study of ancient Roman art and archaeology: Roman representations of faces executed in marble. In the cultural heritage sector, <b>three-dimensional</b> (3 D) <b>scanning</b> finds its primary application in documenting and reconstructing objects and structures mostly of simple geometry: bones, pottery, architecture or the imprint of whole archaeological sites (Adolf 2011). In forensic science, the face is interesting from investigative and probative perspectives, including both recognition and identification. Biometric methods of facial recognition have been part of a plethora of computer science-based applications used in the verification of identity (Davy et al. 2005, Goodwin, Evison and Schofield 2010). The aim of this initial project is to provide objective relevant measurements of key facial features from the two ancient Roman portrait statue <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scans,</b> which will allow the delineation of relationships between individual portraits including formal and stylistics aspects.

Analysis of data within the context of local climate trends at a multidecadal scale indicates the reservoir can amplify seasonal features because of its morphometric properties. Between June to December, the reservoir behaved as a fluvial system, exhibiting a rapid, efficient mixing of the water column. Between January to May, the reservoir developed substantial stratification, and exhibited typical lacustrine characteristics.

40|$|Provided with a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>scan</b> of an Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) and {{position}} data {{as a function}} of time for several key points on the puffin's body throughout a dive into sea water, a moving surface mesh was needed to be used in a boundary element method analysis. A method was developed to generate the surface mesh for each time step in the dive. Changes to existing boundary element method code were made as well, to allow it to work with the puffin geometry. The mesh was generated by interpreting the 3 D scan as a series of 2 D profiles, and finding a finite number of points on each profile. The points were then joined together to form quadrilateral panels. The wing motion of the puffin was recreated by rotating the 2 D wing profiles about axes that correspond to the bird's natural joints.

Bland¿Altman plots of UBCC measurements showed a large positive bias and wide limits of agreement (12 cm; ¿ 4. 6 to 28 cm), which increased as band size increased but decreased when the breasts were digitally removed from the scan prior to the UBCC measurement. The difference in UBCC measurements determined from scans compared to direct measurement had a strong positive correlation with breast volume and breast ptotis. The OBCC measurements showed a small positive bias (2. 4 cm; ¿ 3. 4 to 8. 4), consistent across the range of bra sizes. Bra band size measurements determined from three-dimensional scans can be inaccurate in women with large, ptotic breasts.
