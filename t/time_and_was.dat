5|$|Scouting for Boys was {{published}} in England later in 1908 in book form. The book is now the fourth-bestselling title of all <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> {{the basis for the}} later American version of the Boy Scout Handbook.|$|E

5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> {{left with the}} {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E
5|$|After being {{aided by}} rain {{while in a}} disadvantageous {{position}} during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over Middlesex—to prepare for the next Test at Headingley. Barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> replaced by Neil Harvey. Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.|$|E
5|$|All {{of what is}} now NY31F was {{originally}} designated as part of Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 entered the village of Macedon on modern NY31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY96. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to utilize modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY31F was part of a legislative route at one <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted route number until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, Posen and ten other German battleships {{engaged the}} British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though {{the range and}} poor {{visibility}} prevented effective fire. Shortly thereafter, two British destroyers— and —came under intense fire from the German line. Posen fired at Nestor with both her main battery and secondary guns. At 18:35, Nestor exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet for a second <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> forced to turn away; in doing so, {{the order of the}} German line was reversed. Posen was now the fourth ship in the line, astern of her three sisters.|$|E
5|$|Brussels-born Haitian athlete Nadine Faustin-Parker participated on Haiti's behalf at the Beijing Summer Olympics. She was 32 {{years old}} at the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> the only Haitian {{participating}} in the women's 100meters hurdles. Faustin-Parker previously competed in the same event at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Faustin-Parker participated in the fifth heat during the August 17 preliminary round, completing her event in 13.25seconds. She finished sixth out of eight athletes, ahead of Indonesia's Dedeh Erawati (13.49seconds) and behind the Ukraine's Yevgeniya Snihur (13.06seconds). Faustin-Parker finished in 29th place out of the 40 participating athletes. She did not advance to further rounds.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> the first in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street {{made it easier for}} traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, Kershaw was {{considered}} the top high-school pitcher available. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh overall pick in the draft. He had committed to Texas A University, but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers, with a bonus estimated at $2.3 million. The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft pick at the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 draft.|$|E

5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E
5|$|Finding Nemo was {{released}} on May 30, 2003, and has received universal critical acclaim since. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and was nominated in three more categories, including Best Original Screenplay. Finding Nemo became the highest-grossing animated film at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> the second highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a total of $871 million worldwide {{by the end of}} its initial theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, a 45-minute {{documentary}} was released that provided candid glimpses behind the scenes of the music video's production. Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, like the music video, was shown heavily on MTV for a <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market the cassette, in a profit participation agreement.|$|E

However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired for the second <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> replaced with Brenda.

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> {{made available to the}} public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, the Diocese of Chichester {{selected}} {{an area of}} open land on {{the west}} side of Ditchling Road as the site of their Training College for Anglican Schoolmistresses, which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town. Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building's south façade around the same <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s. In the early 20th century, the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers. Before that, the trainee teachers slept in large rooms in the Training College.|$|E
