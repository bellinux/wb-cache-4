5000|$|Although the {{definitions}} above are generally accepted, scholarly debate rages on {{as to the}} precise nature of release and waiver. According to Kerr, it is a unilateral act. The power <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>a</b> <b>debtor</b> from his obligation rests entirely {{in the hands of}} the creditor, who need only say, [...] "I do not wish to avail myself of this right," [...] in order to terminate it.

The tenth fresco, [...] The Dream of St Martin has recently been attributed to Lorenzo di Credi. Eight of the cycle of ten murals {{are based on the}} Seven Works of Corporal Mercy and show the Buonomini performing activities based on these tasks. The brothers are depicted giving food and drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, giving shelter <b>to</b> pilgrims, <b>releasing</b> <b>a</b> <b>debtor</b> from gaol, burying the dead, witnessing an espousal and making an initial visit to a family in need. The two frescoes which flank the altar show scenes from the life of St Martin of Tours. The depiction {{to the left of the}} altar shows Martin dividing his cloak for the beggar and the one to the right, depicts The Dream of Saint Martin. Inside is an altarpiece of a Madonna with Infant Jesus and St. John by Niccol√≤ Soggi and a bust of St Antoninus which is attributed to Verrocchio.|$|R

5000|$|The {{procedure}} made {{no provision}} for recourse by the debtor to the magistrate or higher authority once an order for committal had been made. Section 65L, which dealt with the <b>release</b> of <b>a</b> <b>debtor</b> from prison, contained no mechanism whereby <b>a</b> <b>debtor,</b> even one against whom a committal order {{had been made in}} absentia, was entitled to approach a court for relief. As a result of these defects, the statute swept up those who could not pay with those who could but simply would not. For this reason, the limitation could not be justified as reasonable, as required by section 33(1) of the Constitution.|$|R
