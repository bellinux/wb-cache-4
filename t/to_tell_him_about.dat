Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E

She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, {{so in order to}} preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, she would never have given her up.

Jenkinson used hand signals <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the road ahead. Radio communication had proved ineffective when they tried it, because when Moss was fully concentrated on his driving he was oblivious to Jenkinson's voice.|$|E

The attackers retreated with seven wounded, including William Mason, the son of a blacksmith living on Craig street, who died of his wounds the following morning.

Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it. At the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up.

However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy.

25|$|When Grant's nephew Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) goes {{missing and}} Phil is {{reluctant}} to get the police involved, Sharon contacts Grant for help, but Courtney (now Alice Nokes) meets Sharon instead; Grant has not seen the messages. Sharon decides {{to go to the}} police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney to ask to stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with Sal due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend Paul Coker (Jonny Labey). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal. Mark also works out who Grant is, but Sharon convinces him he is better off with his adopted father.|$|E

Thus, the CTF staff, under the direction of Colonel James Rusty O'Brien, USAF, had not tried to coordinate the U.S. Army Black Hawk missions into the daily ATOs.

Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as {{a constant reminder of}} Ned's infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can [...] "inhabit" [...] the wolf and share its experiences.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He said {{when he heard the}} two gunshots, he looked through the window and saw a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E
