500|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1985, Madonna started writing and {{recording}} songs for her third studio album, True Blue. She brought back Steve Bray and hired a new producer, Patrick Leonard, to help her on the album. The album's first track [...] "Papa Don't Preach", was written by Brian Elliot, who described it as [...] "a love song, maybe framed a little bit differently". The song is based on teen gossip he heard outside his studio, which has a large front window <b>that</b> <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat. The song was sent to Madonna by Michael Ostin, the same Warner Bros. executive that discovered [...] "Like a Virgin".

500|$|Amy Pettifer of The Quietus {{said the}} song is [...] "scuzzy and {{repetitive}} with a danceable hook—but her voice is at its thinnest and the dynamics a little lacking. Despite all this, it does contain the great lyric, 'It's time to dance and turn this dark into something', which could be the album's epigram." [...] Lee DeVito of Metro Times called it [...] "a bit repetitive" [...] but said it is probably his favorite track on the album. Saeed Saeed of The National said he favored the album's version over its demo, and that, [...] "hankfully, Kanye West rescued it by throwing out the lameness and added the dark and claustrophobic sounds of his seminal 2013 album Yeezus". Bernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald said it is [...] "colder and harder sounding, {{in the way of}} West's own recent work. There's some edge to it but not much menace that would really thrust it into compelling." [...] For Kitty Empire of The Guardian said [...] "Rebel Hearts key collaboration with Kanye West finds two of pop's biggest egomaniacs starring in a wiggly club banger <b>that</b> <b>doubles</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> take-down of the internet's most nutzoid meme". Mark Lore of Paste called it [...] "dark and creepy, and it's one of the best tracks on Rebel Heart".|$|E

Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism towards [...] "Love On Top", writing: [...] " [...] as she forces herself into a rarely used high range, she sets for a perfect {{catharsis}} for the burgeoning sexual passions of the album's first two thirds", and describing the outcome as [...] "absolutely magnificent". Melinda Newman of HitFix commented [...] "the soulful, exuberant, mid-tempo finger snapper, 'Love On Top' is deliciously sunny and sweet." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Love on Top' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T.' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit." [...] Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "scream 'classic disco', catchy, [...] more uptempo and differing {{from the rest of}} the album", concluded that the song shows Beyoncé's versatility and that it is [...] "very Jackson 5". Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is summery and [...] "laidback, rather than massively immediate". However, he added that it proves to be a grower as it [...] "ratchets up the key changes on the final third", further writing that Beyoncé's voice sounds [...] "particularly impressive". A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who compared Beyoncé's work on [...] "Love On Top" [...] to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating [...] "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song was [...] "slinky but nowhere near sexy" [...] adding that it sounds like a song young Brandy Norwood would release.|$|E

2500|$|A notable exception, {{discovered}} in the early 19th century, {{is the use of}} a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. [...] These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does.
