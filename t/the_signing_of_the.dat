In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their {{draft of the}} Declaration to the Second Continental Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not <b>the</b> <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document, which took place later.|$|E

50|$|Rest {{houses were}} envisaged at regular intervals. The {{first to be}} built was <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird at Kennedy's Bush in 1914. This was <b>the</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first scenic reserve that Ell managed to get established in 1906. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse, a smaller house on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaituna Saddle, was the second one to be established in 1916. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi was the third rest house built by Ell. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe was the remaining house to be built.|$|R

50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed for <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse. The last, and grandest, <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed {{to blend in with}} <b>the</b> landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse is managed by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Conservation and used as a hut by trampers.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cross is}} in the Methodist liturgy, {{primarily}} in the Methodist/ Episcopal not necessarily in the UMC. And this is made by some clergy during the Great Thanksgiving, Confession of Sin and Pardon, and benediction. John Wesley, <b>the</b> principal leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Methodists, prepared a revision <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Book <b>of</b> Common Prayer for Methodist use called <b>The</b> Sunday Service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Methodists in North America which does instruct the minister to make <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross on <b>the</b> forehead <b>of</b> children just {{after they have been}} baptized. Making <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross at baptism is retained in <b>the</b> current Book <b>of</b> Worship, and widely practiced (sometimes with oil).Furthermore, on Ash Wednesday <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross is almost always applied by the elder to <b>the</b> foreheads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laity. The liturgy for healing and wholeness, which is becoming more commonly practiced, calls for the pastor to make <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross with oil upon <b>the</b> foreheads <b>of</b> those seeking healing.|$|R

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After <b>the</b> <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by <b>the</b> <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} <b>the</b> {{nonlinear}} response <b>of</b> zero-force members is investigated in linear elastic pin-jointed trusses {{and it is}} shown that in such members the normal force is typically a quadratic function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load parameter, and so <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal force {{does not depend on}} <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load.
