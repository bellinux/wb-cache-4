5|$|Bolton Wanderers {{have not}} won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them {{overcome}} Manchester United in the FA Cup final {{in front of}} a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the League Cup, first in 1995 and again in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Christ Church Football Club in 1874, and adopted its current name in 1877. Founder {{members of the}} Football League in 1888, Bolton have spent {{the highest number of}} seasons of any club in the top flight without winning the title (the 2011–12 season was their 73rd, non-consecutive, year in the top flight). The closest <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the title is third in the First Division on three {{occasions}} (1891–92, 1920–21 and 1924–25). As of 2015, the club has spent more seasons in the top division than any other club outside the current Premier League.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on {{historical}} figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually {{make their way into}} comics and television, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artifacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, this is actually a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E
25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human {{is to run}} away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from {{thousands of years ago}} when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E
25|$|Blue Tories, on {{the other}} hand, were {{originally}} members of the Tory elite drawn from the commercial classes in Montreal and Toronto. Prior to World War II, they were generally conservative in social policy, and classically liberal in economic policy. From 1964 on, this cadre came to identify more with neo-liberal influences in the US Republican Party, as espoused by Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, and the Thatcherite leadership in the British Conservative Party, as represented by Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be termed—in the Canadian lexicon—as neoconservatives. However, there are also Blue Tories who identify strongly with the Monarchy in Canada and other traditional institutions. In Canada, Blue Tories include Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Robert Borden, Preston Manning, and Stephen Harper.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artefacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as goddesses; however, this term is not necessarily accurate for all female anthropomorphic clay figurines, as the archaeological evidence suggests that different figurines were used for different purposes (such as for protection), and so are not all representative of a goddess. There have been so many of these figurines discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> represent one of the more readily identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} of plane waves through a homogeneous medium are fully {{described in terms}} of Jones vectors and 2×2 Jones matrices. However, in practice there are cases in which all of the light cannot be viewed in such a simple manner due to spatial inhomogeneities or the presence of mutually incoherent waves. So-called depolarization, for instance, cannot be described using Jones matrices. For these cases it is usual instead to use a 4×4 matrix that acts upon the Stokes 4-vector. Such matrices were first used by Paul Soleillet in 1929, although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known as Mueller matrices. While every Jones matrix has a Mueller matrix, the reverse is not true. Mueller matrices are then used to describe the observed polarization effects of the scattering of waves from complex surfaces or ensembles of particles, as shall now be presented.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} spring, Cu Roi and Murgen (two of The Nine) {{take four}} thousand men into occupied eastern territory {{to try to}} gain {{the support of the}} Forest Giants. They agree to join the Light, but Soulblighter (Balor's chief lieutenant) springs a surprise attack, trapping The Legion within the Tain; an artifact small enough to hold in one's hand, but which contains a pocket universe of limitless capacity. A group of fifty men led by Murgen find the battle standard of the long-dead Myrkridia, and shortly thereafter, Murgen finds a secret exit. He is able to open it, {{but the rest of the}} four thousand men are lost, as is Cu Roi, whilst Murgen is killed as he destroys the Tain. Shocked at their escape, Soulblighter flees, but news soon arrives that Maeldun has lost Bagrada, and The Deceiver has crossed west. Also, when the remainder of The Nine tried to destroy the Head, which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> believe has been betraying them, they were prevented from doing so by the army, with two of The Nine killed in the ensuing conflict. Meanwhile, Alric joins The Legion.|$|E

The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil.

After warning Tyrion not to trust the Red Priests, Varys leaves for Westeros on a secret mission to find more allies and ships. Tyrion then has a drink with Grey Worm and Missandei. He then tries to introduce them to humor by trading jokes. As they start having a good time, they are interrupted when a fleet which was sent by the masters arrives to attack the city, with Missandei explaining that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> recover their [...] "property".

500|$|The Royal Arms of England are the armorials (or coat of arms) first {{adopted in}} a fixed form {{at the start}} of the age of {{heraldry}} (circa 1200) as personal arms by the Plantagenet kings who ruled England from 1154. In the popular mind <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> symbolise the nation of England, although according to heraldic usage nations do not bear arms, only persons and corporations do. The blazon of the Arms of Plantagenet is: Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langued azure, signifying three identical gold lions (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture azure of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. This coat, designed in the High Middle Ages, has been variously combined with those of the Kings of France, Scotland, a symbol of Ireland, the House of Nassau and [...] the Kingdom of Hanover, according to dynastic and other political changes occurring in England, but has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I (1189–1199), the second Plantagenet king.|$|E
