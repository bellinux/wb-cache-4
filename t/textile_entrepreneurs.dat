50|$|For {{almost a}} century, the Montgomery Building {{has been a}} {{historic}} structure in Spartanburg. When it was built, Spartanburg County {{had become one of}} the two largest counties in the state. By the early 1920s, textiles and railroads had made Spartanburg the Hub City, a prosperous and forward-looking community in the Carolina Piedmont. The city’s business leadership recognized that the area’s increasing number of professionals and businessmen needed more good quality office space. The building took its name from the Montgomery family, one of the leading families of <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> in the area. It was built on the site of Captain John Montgomery’s home, which reflects that up to that point, North Church Street between downtown and the Wofford College campus was largely a residential area. Montgomery had founded the Spartan Mill {{on the north side of}} Spartanburg, and three of his sons wound up in different branches of the family textile business.|$|E
5000|$|Business History in Britain {{emerged in}} the 1950s {{following}} {{the publication of a}} series of influential company histories and the establishment of the journal Business History in 1958 at the University of Liverpool. The most influential of these early company histories was Charles Wilson (historian)’s History of Unilever, the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman’s work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington’s and glass manufacture. [...] These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms {{in the development of the}} wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. William Lazonick for example argued that cotton <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler’s synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.|$|E
40|$|The Dutch seventeenth century, a ‘Golden Age’ ridden by intense ideological conflict, pioneered global trade, {{participatory}} {{politics and}} religious toleration. Its history is epitomized by {{the life and}} works of the brothers Johan (1622 - 1660) and Pieter de la Court (1618 - 1685), two successful <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> and radical republican theorists during the apex of Dutch primacy in world trade. This book explores the many facets of the brothers’ political thought, focusing on their ground-breaking argument that commerce forms the mainstay of republican politics. With a contextual analysis that highlights the interaction between thinking and acting, between intellectual and cultural history, the book reveals the international significance of this commercial republicanism and it proposes a novel, rhetorical approach to seventeenth-century Dutch political culture...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to contribute with knowledge for understanding how entrepreneurs develop and utilize professional networks including an analysis of how they exploit experiences obtained during the pre-history of their ventures in textiles in Borås. This research will not only gather knowledge and understanding about how a network in general are developed and utilized but also about differences between male and female entrepreneurs in a textile cluster. Hopefully this research will enhance the understanding of how to support small ventures in expanding their network building on the strengths emanating from the pre-history of entrepreneurs. Method: A qualitative study with 12 semi structured interviews with <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Borås. Results: The result from this report showed that the entrepreneurs utilize their pre-history resources and capabilities in order to develop their venture and network. The reliance on family, friends and the ability of having a mentor are crucial for acquiring a rewarding and beneficial network. The level of trust between the actors is vital in order to establish long - term relationships in a professional network as well as for developing a personal brand. Being a part of the embedded structure through networking in the region of Borås facilitates the access to a broad set of resources, including social capital. The results show few differences between male and female entrepreneurs, {{when it comes to their}} utilization of professional networks. The main difference lies in the way that entrepreneurs seek new resources. Females tend to have a more careful, prudent and thoughtful approach while male entrepreneurs tend to have a more trial and error approach. Conclusion: The companies within the textile region of Borås are characterized by the so called “Knalleanda” which can be described as a tradition of having a particularly independent mindset as an entrepreneur from this region. This tradition may affect the characteristics of the networks between textile companies due to competition and lack of integration. However, the conclusion of the research in this thesis are that the entrepreneurs 3 represented in this study shows no hesitation in participating or joining organizations, such as Marketplace, nor interacting with likeminded actors, for example other <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs.</b> This research has contributed with knowledge to Tillväxtverkets call for studies that investigates growth in textile ventures as well as studies for understanding female entrepreneurship...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how {{changing}} ideas of moral order between 1780 and 1880 were expressed {{in the perception of}} and designs for the industrial environment. The term industrial environment' includes industrial plant, especially textile mills, and built environments that were closely connected with the running of an industrial enterprise, for example workers' housing and public parks. The lives and works of five <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> are examined: the Gotts of Leeds, the Mimes of Wakefield, the Akroyds of Halifax, the Crossleys of Halifax and the Salts of Bradford and Saltaire. Chapter One is an examination of the theme of moral order and the industrial environment in England from 1780 - 1830. It considers varying and conflicting moral attitudes to industrial environments, those of poets like Wordsworth and industrialists like Arkwright. It includes a detailed criticism of the novel Shirley by Charlotte Brontë. Chapter Two is an examination of the attitudes of merchants and clothiers to the rise of the factory system in Leeds. Chapter Three considers the life and work of Benjamin Gott and his sons. Gott's attitude to industrial landscape reflected his dual role as a merchant and manufacturer. The careers of two families of Wakefield merchants, the Milnes and the Naylors, are examined in Chapter Four. Chapter Five is an examination of the theme of moral order and the industrial environment in England from 1830 to 1880. It emphasises how some Victorian industrialists attempted to extend their moral influence beyond their factory gates into the places where their workers spent their leisure time. This is seen as an attempt to foster more cordial class relations than existed in manufacturing districts in the l 840 s. This chapter includes a criticism of the novel 'North and South' by Elizabeth Gaskell. The industrial and social changes in early Victorian Halifax are outlined in Chapter Six. Chapters Seven and Eight examine the response of two large manufacturers to class conflict in Halifax in the 1840 s. The Akroyds and the Crossleys created and sponsored a wide range of 'model' environments including houses, churches and parks. Chapters Nine and Ten are an examination of the career and influence of Titus Salt. Salt created a model mill village, Saltaire, as an antitype to the squalor, crime and industrial unrest of Bradford where he ran five mills in the 1840 s. An assessment is made of how successful the Akroyds, Crossleys and Salts were in their attempts to moralise mill workers. Their moral attitudes are compared with those of the Gotts and the Milnes who made their careers in the period 1780 - 1830...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} overturns longstanding {{assumptions about}} the experience of exile in early modern Europe. Historians usually consider religious refugees as hardliners, because they refused to conform to another faith and went into exile. Scholars have also emphasised the religious transformation of exiles, arguing that their stay abroad turned them into devout and radical people who infused their home society with a militant sense of piety. This dissertation, however, argues {{that the experience of}} exile {{had little to do with}} religious heroism. Focussing on Huguenot refugees in the Dutch Republic, exile emerges as a complex and profoundly unsettling experience. The decision to go into exile was not simply a quest for religious freedom, but was also motivated by socio-economic opportunities. Exiles were thus not altogether different from labour migrants who left their homes in search of a better life elsewhere, because both needed accurate information about destinations and employment abroad, have some money to cover their voyage, and make ends meet once they had arrived in a foreign city. A fresh look at the careers of Huguenot ministers, booksellers and <b>textile</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> reveals that many refugees actually struggled to make ends meet. Early modern exiles, then, were more than courageous people who put faith before material well-being; they were also flesh-and-blood migrants living a difficult life abroad. Religion was an obvious source of comfort for refugees, but it hardly transformed them into religious radicals. A close reading of printed and handwritten exile sermons demonstrates that Huguenots struggled to make sense of their stay in exile. Why, for example, had God struck down their churches, and why had most Huguenots converted to Catholicism? By considering sermons as a dynamic medium, this dissertation argues that refugee ministers used their pulpit to preach a message of hope and purpose. The Revocation and abandoning one’s possessions for an uncertain future in exile were portrayed as part of God’s plan to sift the sinners from the devout, until He would lead them back into France. The 1697 Peace of Rijswijk, however, did not grant any concessions to French Protestants. As the refugees realised that the harrowing experience of exile was likely to be permanent rather than temporary, around 1, 000 of them even converted to Catholicism and went back to France. Huguenot refugees also turned to their own past for comfort. Interestingly, the individual accounts of refugees contain a large degree of cross-confessional friendship, while the histories written by Huguenot ministers abound with Catholic villains. This dissertation argues that this quantum leap from individual to collective memory can be explained by “memory brokers”, refugee ministers who sought to create a more triumphant account of the Huguenot past. Their histories have been extremely successful, as scholars still find it difficult to abandon the idea that the Huguenots – or any other wave of religious refugees – were essentially courageous people. As a result, we have ended up with black-and-white histories that ignore the many shades of grey that the experience of exile entailed...|$|E
