25|$|Another {{practice}} {{was the use}} of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil. Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken {{with the use of a}} feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once <b>the</b> <b>sore</b> was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal <b>the</b> <b>sore</b> with digence.|$|E

25|$|Pressure ulcers may {{be caused}} by {{inadequate}} blood supply and resulting reperfusion injury when blood re-enters tissue. A simple example of a mild pressure sore may be experienced by healthy individuals while sitting in the same position for extended periods of time: the dull ache experienced is indicative of impeded blood flow to affected areas. Within 2 hours, this shortage of blood supply, called ischemia, may lead to tissue damage and cell death. <b>The</b> <b>sore</b> will initially start as a red, painful area. The other process of pressure ulcer development is seen when pressure is high enough to damage the cell membrane of muscle cells. The muscle cells die as a result and skin fed through blood vessels coming through the muscle die. This is the deep tissue injury form of pressure ulcers and begins as purple intact skin.|$|E

500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him.

[...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, <b>the</b> <b>sore</b> loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

500|$|Bird {{invented the}} {{electric}} moxa in 1843. [...] The {{name is a}} reference to the acupuncture technique of moxibustion and was probably influenced by the introduction of electroacupuncture, in which the needles are augmented by an electric current, two decades earlier in France. [...] The electric moxa, however, was not intended for acupuncture. It was used to produce a suppurating sore on the skin of the patient to treat some conditions of inflammation and congestion by the technique of counter-irritation. [...] <b>The</b> <b>sore</b> had previously been created by much more painful means, such as cautery or even burning charcoal. [...] Bird's design was based on a modification of an existing instrument for the local electrical treatment of hemiplegia, and consisted of a silver electrode and a zinc electrode connected by copper wire. [...] Two small blisters were produced on the skin, to which the two electrodes were then connected and held in place for a few days. [...] Electricity was generated by electrolytic action with body fluids. [...] The blister under the silver electrode healed, but the one under the zinc electrode produced the required suppurating sore.Simpson, p. 8 ...|$|E

40|$|Syphilis is a {{venereal disease}} spread during sexual intercourse. It {{can also be}} passed from mother to child during pregnancy. It {{is caused by a}} corkscrew-shaped {{bacterium}} called a spirochete, Treponema pallidum. This microscopic organism resides in many organs of the body but causes sores or ulcers (called chancres) to appear on the skin of the penis, vagina, mouth, and occasionally in the rectum, or on the tongue, lips, or breast. During sex the bacteria leave <b>the</b> <b>sores</b> of one person and enter the moist membranes of their partner's penis, vagina, mouth, or rectum. Once the spirochetes wiggle inside a victim, they begin to multiple at an amazing rate. (Some bacteria have a doubling rate of 30 minutes. You may want to consider how many bacteria you might have in 12 hours if one bacterium entered your body doubling at that rate.) The spirochetes then enter the lymph circulation, which carries them to nearby lymph glands that may swell in response to the infection. This first stage of the disease (called primary syphilis) lasts only a few weeks and usually causes hard red sores or ulcers to develop on the genitals of the victim, who can then pass the disease on to someone else. During this primary stage, a blood test will not reveal the disease but the bacteria can be scraped from <b>the</b> <b>sores.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sores</b> soon heal and some people may recover entirely without treatment. Secondary syphilis develops two to six weeks after <b>the</b> <b>sores</b> heal. Then flu-like symptoms appear with fever...|$|R

50|$|Candida can be {{detected}} in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. This organism {{is found in the}} mouths of about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects <b>the</b> <b>sores</b> at <b>the</b> corners of the mouth and prevents <b>the</b> <b>sores</b> from healing.|$|R
