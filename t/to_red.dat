50|$|On July 27, 1930, Ash {{earned a}} win against the Chicago Cubs {{with just one}} inning of relief and with him only {{throwing}} one pitch. Ash {{was called in to}} relief by Cincinnati Manager Dan Howley with the Reds trailing 3-2 in the top of sixth. The Cubs had two runners on base, Hack Wilson on third, and Danny Taylor on first. At the plate for Chicago was Charlie Grimm. Grimm grounded Ash's first pitch <b>to</b> <b>Reds</b> shortstop Hod Ford. Wilson broke for home. Ford threw the ball <b>to</b> <b>Reds</b> third baseman Tony Cuccinello who then threw <b>to</b> <b>Reds</b> catcher Clyde Sukeforth who successfully ran down Wilson and tagged him for out number one. In the meantime, Grimm after reaching first base set off for second. Taylor was still occupying that base. Grimm tried returning to first, but Sukeforth threw the ball <b>to</b> <b>Reds</b> first baseman Joe Stripp. Stripp tagged Grimm for out number two.|$|R

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow <b>to</b> <b>red</b> mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange <b>to</b> <b>red</b> cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed <b>to</b> <b>red</b> and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time <b>to</b> <b>red</b> with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E

Further portions in the intercanyon areas of Acton to Soledad Pass were completed by 1965. By 1966 the freeway was complete {{as far north as}} Avenue P-8 in Palmdale. The freeway was completed to Mojave by 1972.|$|E
