5|$|In January 2007, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>News</b> leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
