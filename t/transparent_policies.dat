A significant indicator for repair and/or upgrade decisions is the Performance Loss (PL), that {{is a measure of}} variation of building seismic capacity from intact to damaged state.

This study investigates, by means of a detailed case study, the expected PL for increasing seismic demand and its relationship with varied building safety level. The response of an existing non-ductile reinforced concrete building is simulated using a finite element model that properly accounts for both flexural, shear and axial failure of members and simulates joints behavior. Different definitions of building collapse are introduced, and consistent assessment of building PL are performed. The study shows interesting relations between PL and building safety level for varying return period of the damaging earthquake, demonstrating its usability as a practical indicator for reparability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} {{monetary policy}} changes into anticipated and unanticipated ones. Then US Treasury rate pass-through {{and the corresponding}} central bank reaction function are analyzed within an asymmetric error-correction framework. Our empirical analysis indicates that changes in policy rate {{have a significant effect}} on Treasury rates in all maturity spectra during periods of anticipated policies only, implying asymmetric transmission. Moreover, some evidence is provided in favor of a nonlinear adjustment toward a long-run equilibrium, as the long-term rates adjust faster in such periods. Impulse response analysis indicates that in periods of low monetary policy anticipation, a shock in long term rates may engage central bank to significant reactions reflected in the policy rate with possible destabilizing effects for the economy. Given that smooth interest rate movements are linked to successful management of the economy more <b>transparent</b> <b>policies</b> are suggested. Our findings can be useful for the US monetary authorities in their attempt to monitor the long-term rate pass-through and reinforce monetary policy effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
