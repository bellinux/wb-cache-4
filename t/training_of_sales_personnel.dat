40|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{separated}} winning hotels from losers in the recession was the hotels’ management of marketing expenses. By matching a group of 100 winners to 106 losers, based on high or low financial performance during the nadir of the recent recession, the study highlights the effects of marketing expenses as one primary driver of revenue and profit. The study compares the two groups’ revenue and profitability metrics to determine the two groups’ financial performance as the recession wore on. The results of this study show significant differences between winners and losers when measured by top-line indicators (Average Daily Rate [ADR], RevPAR, TRevPAR) and profitability (GOPPAR and NOIPAR). Winners were also found to spend significantly more on marketing than losers. The relationship between marketing expenditures and performance is significantly positive, with franchise expenses and other sales expenses emerging as the most important determinants of RevPAR, GOPPAR, and NOIPAR. In particular, these results highlight the importance of personal sales efforts, including promotions, familiarization trips, trade shows, and the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>personnel,</b> personal sales visits to clients, and use of outside sales representatives to help hotels thrive in a recession. These data lead to the conclusion that firms that “invest” in marketing, especially in tough times, can achieve a payoff via various revenue drivers (e. g., trade shows) and will realize gains beyond just the short term...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. The main goals were to investigate the professional skills <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>personnel</b> working with complex selling in technology- based companies and to inquire into the potential and limitations of supporting their day-to-day work {{through the use of}} interactive media and media services. The starting points of the investigation were the hermeneutic-pragmatic methodology and the practice-related knowledge theory that constitute the basis of the dialogue seminar method. This method has been developed - and is continually being developed - within the research at INDEK/Professional Skill and Technology, following the philosophical tradition of Wittgenstein (his late philosophy). Building on this foundation, and also using metaphors and analogies between science and art, it has been possible to investigate the skills <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>personnel</b> {{and find a way to}} describe and classify these skills in practice-related terms of knowledge and experience. Through this, different aspects of the skills have been identified, a few of which have not been previously discussed. By contemplating these aspects and reflecting them in different aspects of media, a set of the general potential and limitations of interactive media and media services in supporting the daily work <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>personnel</b> has been identified. However, the specific potential and limitations of the cases in question, e. g. the <b>sales</b> force <b>of</b> a certain industrial company, remain to be investigated, preferably by fully applying the dialogue seminar method, which was only partly within the scope of this investigation. Finally, a weak point in the mainstream science of Human Computer Interaction was identified in its lack of anchorage in a knowledge theory applicable to practical working life. QC 2010093...|$|R

Following recent interest in broadly cognitive, distributed and embedded understandings <b>of</b> both <b>sales</b> (author, 2006) and innovation (Nightingale, 1998, 2003), this paper proposes an understanding of product development that is processual, iterative and suggests a reconsideration of the role of science.

Visibility finds an expression as those market objects are exchanged, such that objects can be devices by which other actors join in and position themselves and their objects within markets...|$|R
