Que se vayan del Canal (I wish <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.|$|E

I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E

People got the first album, and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said {{a lot of things that}} people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [...] that people didn't want to talk about." ...|$|E

She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be as cool as can be doing their thing. I thought, 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Wanting {{to stray}} {{away from the}} R-styled music of Thankful, which she {{described}} as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankfuls success [...] "empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe." [...] She described {{the music of the}} second album as [...] "like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool." [...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what it was.

2500|$|For {{the first}} time ever Danilova has brought in session musicians: Nick Johnson (drums, who {{is also a member of}} her live band), Sean McCann (viola, violin) and Ryan York (cello, double bass). [...] "I can't play violin or cello or {{stand-up}} bass, or drums. I can play keyboards, kind of. So all the keyboard parts I wrote and played, and then I would send the string parts that I had wrote on the keyboard to the string players and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> mimic that. Same with the drums. I try to do as much as possible, still, but I wish I could play drums", she explained.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{point of}} honour the band refuses to use playback; they always play live and rehearse before every appearance, {{ensuring}} that no two performances are the same. This was clearly demonstrated in 2002, when the band was booked to appear on UK national TV channel GMTV, where they were to play [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] before being interviewed. The producer was astounded when the band arrived at 5am (three hours early) expecting {{to set up and}} rehearse; it had been assumed <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> mime to playback. Joanne Catherall explained why on air during the interview: [...] "We simply don't sound like we did 20 years ago; it would be wrong if we used tapes, so we do everything live." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} Super Bowl XIII {{centered around}} Cowboys linebacker Thomas [...] "Hollywood" [...] Henderson. Henderson caused {{quite a stir}} before the NFC Championship Game by claiming that the Rams had [...] "no class" [...] and the Cowboys would shut them out. His prediction {{turned out to be}} very accurate; the Cowboys did shut them out, aided by Henderson's 68-yard interception return for a touchdown. In the days leading up the Super Bowl, Henderson began talking about the Steelers in the same manner. He predicted another shutout and then made unflattering comments about several Pittsburgh players. He put down the talent and the intelligence of Bradshaw, proclaiming [...] "Bradshaw couldn't spell 'cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'." [...] But the Steelers refused to get into a war of words with Henderson. Greene responded by saying the Steelers didn't need to say they were the best, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> go out on the field and [...] "get the job done.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After his hiring in 2008, del Toro {{confirmed}} the sequel {{would be about}} [...] "trying to reconcile {{the facts of the}} first movie with a slightly different point of view. You would be able to see events that were not witnessed in the first." [...] He also noted the story must be drawn from only what is mentioned in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, as {{they do not have the}} rights to The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. DelToro also added (before writing began) that if they could not find a coherent story for the second film, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> film The Hobbit, stating [...] "The Hobbit is better contained in a single film and kept brisk and fluid with no artificial 'break point'." [...] By November 2008, he acknowledged that the book was more detailed and eventful than people may remember. He decided to abandon the [...] "bridge film" [...] concept, feeling that it would be better for the two parts to contain only material from The Hobbit: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mesopotamians had symbols {{for each}} power of ten. [...] Later, they wrote their numbers in {{almost exactly the}} same way done in modern times. [...] Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> put the {{coefficient}} of that number. [...] Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of Alexander the Great, they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder. [...] The Mesopotamians also used a sexagesimal system, that is base sixty. [...] It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in Cuneiform script, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians and the system of metrology from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.|$|E
2500|$|Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods {{with about}} 80,000 players, {{including}} popular streamers, to gauge initial {{reaction to the}} gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release. The early access phase on Steam began in March 2017 for the Windows version. This early access period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, Greene announced that {{they would need to}} extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period [...] "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met". Initially, Bluehole had expected that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release. Bluehold anticipated to leave the early access period by late December 2017.|$|E
