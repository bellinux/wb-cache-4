5|$|De Candolle, in {{the first}} {{systematic}} taxonomy of Narcissus, arranged the species into named groups, and <b>those</b> <b>names</b> have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority. The situation was confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties, {{and it was not}} till the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus, Narcissus.|$|E
5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Tolkien {{pretends to}} be merely the {{translator}} of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He says that <b>those</b> <b>names</b> and terms in the work (as well in the earlier The Hobbit) that appear in English {{are meant to be}} his purported translations from the Common Speech.|$|E
5|$|From an {{administrative}} viewpoint, 21 of the {{counties in the}} republic are units of local government. The other six {{have more than one}} local council area, producing a total of 31 county-level authorities. County Tipperary had two ridings, North Tipperary and South Tipperary, originally established in 1838, renamed in 2001 and amalgamated in 2014. The cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing <b>those</b> <b>names.</b> The cities of Limerick and Waterford were merged with their respective county councils in 2014 to form new city and county councils. The remaining part of County Dublin is divided into Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin.|$|E

5|$|The {{planet and}} its host star were {{selected}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) {{as part of a}} competition for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, for some systems that did not already have proper names. The process involved nominations by educational groups and public voting for the proposed names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Ran for the star and AEgir for the planet. <b>Those</b> <b>names</b> had been submitted by the pupils of the 8th Grade at Mountainside Middle School in Colbert, Washington, United States. Both names derive from Norse mythology: Rán is the goddess of the sea and Ægir, her husband, is the god of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead of {{attempting}} to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of <b>those</b> <b>names</b> were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Lake Luzerne, NY9N begins {{to deviate from}} the Hudson River, {{gradually}} curving to the northeast as it passes through the hamlets of Lake Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, {{all of which are}} named for small lakes bearing <b>those</b> <b>names</b> {{near the center of the}} communities. Just northeast of Lake Vanare, NY9N enters the town of Lake George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit21 and meets US9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village of Lake George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US9 and NY9N serve as the primary north–south thoroughfare through the village before splitting at the north end of the village. While US9 continues to the north, NY9N heads northeast along the western edge of Lake George.|$|E

The second, somewhat more obscurely, are <b>those</b> <b>named</b> after an individual but without explicitly making this clear.|$|R

25|$|The Domain Name System delegates the {{responsibility}} of assigning domain names and mapping <b>those</b> <b>names</b> to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers.

25|$|Many Nuer {{have been}} exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father's given name follows the child's given name, which is then {{followed}} by the grandfather's name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry <b>those</b> <b>names</b> themselves.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, Johannes Magnus {{constructed}} a mythical line of Swedish kings, beginning with Magog, {{the son of}} Japheth, to demonstrate the antiquity of the Swedish throne. On {{the basis of his}} list, Eric XIV and Charles IX adopted their high ordinals; previous monarchs with <b>those</b> <b>names</b> are traditionally numbered counting backward from Eric XIV and Charles IX.
