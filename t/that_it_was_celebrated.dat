2500|$|In {{the sixth}} century the Office of Vespers in the Latin Church was almost {{the same as it}} has been {{throughout}} the Middle Ages and up to the present day. In a document of unquestionable authority of that period the Office is described as follows: The evening hour, or vespertina synaxis, is composed of four psalms, a capitulum, a response, a hymn, a versicle, a canticle from the Gospel, litany (Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison), Pater with the ordinary finale, oratio, or prayer, and dismissal (Regula Sancti Benedicti, xvii). The psalms recited are taken from the series of psalms from Pss. 109 to 147 (with the exception of the groups 117 to 127 and 133 to 142); Pss. 138, 143, 144 are each divided into two portions, whilst the Pss. 115 and 116 are united to form one. This disposition is almost {{the same as that of}} the [...] "Ordo Romanus", except that the number of psalms recited is five instead of four. They are taken, however, from the series 109 to 147. Here, too, we find the capitulum, versicle, and canticle of the [...] "Magnificat". The hymn is a more recent introduction in the Roman Vespers; the finale (litanies, Pater, versicles, prayers) seems all to have existed from this epoch as in the Benedictine cursus. Like the other hours, therefore, Vespers is divided into two parts; the psalmody, or singing of the psalms, forming the first part, and the capitulum and formulæ the second. Vesper time varied according to the season between the tenth hour (4 p.m.) and the twelfth (6 p.m.). As a matter of fact it was no longer the evening hour, but the sunset hour, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>celebrated</b> before the day had departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light (Regula S. Benedicti, xli). This is a point to be noted, as it was an innovation. Before this epoch this evening synaxis was celebrated with all the torches alight. The reason of this is that St Benedict introduced in the cursus, another hour—that of Compline—which was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening, and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the Office of Lucernarium.|$|E

50|$|A second {{usage of}} the term used in medieval times {{occurred}} across England, persisting most notably in Northamptonshire, when the Sunday after the feast of Saint Thomas Becket (29 December) was commonly known as Relick Sunday.

50|$|An Agonalia or Agonia was {{an obscure}} archaic {{religious}} observance celebrated in ancient Rome {{several times a}} year, in honor of various divinities. Its institution, like that of other religious rites and ceremonies, was attributed to Numa Pompilius, the semi-legendary second king of Rome.

50|$|In 1939, the Spanish Civil War {{had just}} ended, {{beginning}} (or continuing, {{depending on the}} part of Spain) the dictatorship of general Francisco Franco. A work premiered in Spain in this highly charged environment had to celebrate, or pretend to celebrate, or permit the interpretation <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>celebrating,</b> the current political situation and regime. The celebration of a palace and gardens of a sixteenth-century Habsburg king offered no ideological threat to the regime, and was in harmony with its emerging policy of celebrating Spanish history, conservatively interpreted.|$|R

5000|$|The Compitalia {{belonged to}} the feriae conceptivae, that is, festivals which were celebrated on days {{appointed}} annually by the magistrates or priests.

Dionysius again relates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>celebrated</b> {{a few days after the}} Saturnalia, and Cicero that it fell on the Kalends of January; but in one of his letters to Atticus, he speaks of it as occurring on the fourth before the Nones of January, that is, January 2.

Federal Territory day is celebrated in the three Federal territories. Malaysia Day, held on 16 September to commemorate the formation of Malaysia, became a nationwide holiday in 2010.

50|$|In ancient Roman religion, the Quinquatria or Quinquatrus was {{a festival}} sacred to the Goddess Minerva, {{celebrate}}d from the 19-23 of March. The older festivals were of Etruscan origin and were {{to celebrate the}} Spring Equinox, the spring rebirth rites of women. According to Varro, it was so-called because it was held on the fifth (quinqu-) day after the Ides, {{in the same way}} as the Tusculans called a festival on the sixth day after the Ides Sexatrus or one on the seventh Septimatrus. Both Varro and Festus state that the Quinquatrus was celebrated for only one day, but Ovid says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>celebrated</b> for five days, hence the name: on the first day no blood was shed, but that on the last four there were contests of gladiators. The first day was the festival proper, and that the following four were an expansion made perhaps in the time of Caesar to gratify the people. The ancient Roman religious calendars assign only one day to the festival.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 May 1567, Mary {{was married}} to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who on 12 May had been created Duke of Orkney. The banns had been proclaimed, much against his will, by John Craig, {{minister}} of Edinburgh. The marriage was celebrated, after the Protestant form, by the Bishop of Orkney, in the council chamber at Holyrood House. Calderwood says that 'the Bishop of Orkney, at the marriage, made a declaratioun of the Erle of Bothwell his repentance for his former offensive life; how he had joined himself to the Kirk, and embraced the reformed religioun;' he adds, 'but they were married the same day, in the morning, with a masse, as was reported by men of credite.' The authorities for this statement are Birrell's diary, which says that the marriage was performed by the Bishop of Orkney in the Chapel Royal; Murray's diary, which affirms <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>celebrated</b> 'efter baith the sortis of the kirkis, reformit and unreformit;' and {{the representation of the}} confederate barons that it was 'accomplished in baith the fashions.' ...|$|E

Canadians who reach 65 years of age become senior citi-zens. This title, while bringing with it certain privileges, mostly commands respect and recognition, as senior citi-zens are the ones who, through their wisdom, commitment, and hard work, contributed to the evolution of the living conditions we now enjoy in our great country; conditions that are the envy of many societies.
