500|$|The scenes {{depicting}} Washington, D.C. in {{the episode}} were filmed at Simon Fraser University on Burnaby Mountain in British Columbia. Shooting at this location was made difficult by the confined space available {{in which to}} set up the necessary equipment. The invisible alien featured in this episode appears to be inspired by the movie Predator. The alien was deliberately made invisible in order for it to be scarier to the audience, with series creator Chris Carter noting that [...] "what you don't see is scarier <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do see". Casting director Lynne Carrow was proud of Scott Bellis' performance as Max, calling him in 1995 perhaps her proudest find in casting the show, saying that he [...] "Just knocked our socks off". Carter also praised the performance of guest star Marshall Bell as Colonel Henderson and was proud that the episode permitted the producers to expand the role of Deep Throat. Actor Brent Stait, who plays Corporal Taylor in the episode, teaches alongside series regular William B. Davis at the William Davis Centre for Actors Study in Vancouver.|$|E
500|$|Seamus Blackley {{designed}} the game's physics system, {{which is a}} modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glass's flight simulator Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as [...] "far more sophisticated <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would normally use for an indoor game". The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The game's most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character's head [...] "tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks back a bit when you stop", and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its [...] "head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [...] mass and velocity of the objects involved". On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, [...] "If games don't obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn't right", and that [...] "the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn't notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should".|$|E
500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were, you would / Be so much more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E

2500|$|Orgasm {{has been}} widely {{described}} in literature over the centuries. In antiquity, Latin literature addressed the subject as much as Greek literature: Book III of Ovid's Metamorphoses retells a discussion between Jove and Juno, in which the former states: [...] "The sense of pleasure in the male is far / More dull and dead, <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> females share." [...] Juno rejects this thought; they agree to ask the opinion of Tiresias ("who had known Venus/Love in both ways," [...] having lived seven years as a female). Tiresias offends Juno by agreeing with Jove, and she strikes him blind on the spot (Jove lessens the blow by giving Tiresias the gift of foresight, and a long life). Earlier, in the Ars Amatoria, Ovid states that he abhors sexual intercourse that fails to complete both partners.|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
2500|$|... 411Mania {{gave it a}} {{score of}} 9.6 out of 10 and said that it {{initially}} [...] "felt like Call of Duty, but as I progressed through the game, I {{found that there was}} substantially more. The game plays it by the numbers in many ways but it's very polished and fun. The multiplayer will keep you occupied for months. Any PS3 owner will do themselves a disservice by not picking up this game." [...] USA Today gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, [...] "Easily the best game for the new Sony PlayStation 3 game console, Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter that lets you, as an American soldier stationed in the United Kingdom, lead the fight to rid the world of a vicious alien race." [...] Maxim similarly gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game [...] "managed to exceed our lofty expectations, but only by an wirey crotch hair." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald also gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "an accomplished shooter providing many fun online modes, engaging solo missions and superb weapons." [...] However, The New York Times gave it an average review, saying that [...] "In spite of rave reviews it’s a fairly pedestrian humans-versus-aliens first-person shooter that brings nothing new to the genre. The artificial intelligence of combatants is lackluster, and the semi-sepia-toned graphics are surprisingly unimpressive, no better <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would see on the five-year-old Xbox." ...|$|E
