5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became {{a rallying cry}} {{for a new generation}} of Serbian politicians. During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician Ivan Stambolić, who became President of Serbia, urged <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{numerous}} treaties {{signed by the}} former republics, in order to direct the transition period, was a temporary agreement on general purpose forces, signed in Minsk on 14 February 1992. However, once {{it became clear that}} Ukraine (and potentially <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics)</b> was determined to undermine the concept of joint general purpose forces and form their own armed forces, the new Russian government moved to form its own armed forces.|$|E
5000|$|Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941) is <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Republic</b> serial {{based on}} a Fawcett comic ...|$|R
5000|$|This serial {{is notable}} for {{featuring}} the only character actually called [...] "Rocket Man", a misnomer applied by fans to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Republic</b> rocket-powered-suited heroes that followed in their later serials, Radar Men from the Moon (1952), Zombies of the Stratosphere (1952), and Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe (1953).|$|R
5000|$|For the serial, {{a number}} of new outer space scenes were filmed that had not been seen before in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Republic</b> serials, {{including}} [...] "space walks" [...] for several exterior spaceship repairs; aerial raygun duels between [...] "hero" [...] and [...] "enemy" [...] spaceships; and black star fields (rather than daylight and cloud-spotted skies) for backgrounds when Cody's or the villain's spaceships were shown outside the Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|Milošević {{refused to}} agree to the plan, as he claimed that the European Community had no right to {{dissolve}} Yugoslavia and that the plan was not in the interests of Serbs as it would divide the Serb people into four republics (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Croatia). Carington responded by putting the issue to a vote in which all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics,</b> including Montenegro under Momir Bulatović, initially agreed to the plan that would dissolve Yugoslavia. However, after intense pressure from Serbia on Montenegro's President, Montenegro changed its position to oppose the dissolution of Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|The Transcaucasian SFSR was {{dissolved}} in 1936 {{and as a}} result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The transition to communism was difficult for Armenia, and for most of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no freedom of speech, even less so under Joseph Stalin. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to Siberia during Stalinist rule. Even Zabel Yessayan, a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian Genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 Slobodan Milošević, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia since 1986, became president of Serbia, {{the largest and most}} populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> sought to loosen the central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Supported by Germany and the Vatican, Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.|$|E
5000|$|In particular, {{the term}} [...] "enemy of the workers" [...] was formalized in the Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code), and similar {{articles}} in the codes of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Soviet <b>Republics.</b>|$|R
50|$|As with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Soviet <b>republics,</b> Turkmenia had {{followed}} the Marxist-Leninist ideology governed by the republic's sole party, Communist Party of Turkmenistan, a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|This {{constitution}} {{was created by}} the influence of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Yugoslav <b>republic,</b> especially Slovenia and Croatia, in order to suppress Serbias power and create an environment for the exploitation of Serbias natural resources ...|$|R
25|$|Russia {{experiences}} a constant flow of immigration. On average, close to 300,000 legal immigrants {{enter the country}} every year; about half are ethnic Russians from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> of the former Soviet Union. There is a significant inflow of ethnic Armenians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz and Tajiks into big Russian cities, something that is viewed unfavorably by some citizens. According to a 2013 opinion poll, 74% of Russians view {{the large number of}} labor migrants as a negative phenomenon. According to the United Nations, Russia's legal immigrant population is the third biggest in the world, numbering 11.6 million. In addition, there are an estimated 4 million illegal immigrants from the ex-Soviet states in Russia. In 2015, Ukraine-Russia was the world's largest migration corridor after Mexico-USA. According to the Armenian government, between 80,000 and 120,000 Armenians travel to Russia every year to do seasonal work, returning home for the winter. According to the Tajik government, at least 870,000 Tajiks are working in Russia. In 2014, remittances from Russia accounted for around one-third of Kyrgyzstan's and over 40% of Tajikistan's GDP.|$|E
25|$|At last Gorbachev {{attempted}} {{to restructure the}} Soviet Union into a less centralized state. However, on 19 August 1991, a coup against Gorbachev, conspired by senior Soviet officials, was attempted. The coup faced wide popular opposition and collapsed in three days, but disintegration of the Union became imminent. The Russian government took {{over most of the}} Soviet Union government institutions on its territory. Because of the dominant position of Russians in the Soviet Union, most gave little thought to any distinction between Russia and the Soviet Union before the late 1980s. In the Soviet Union, only Russian SFSR lacked even the paltry instruments of statehood that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> possessed, such as its own republic-level Communist Party branch, trade union councils, Academy of Sciences, and the like. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was banned in Russia in 1991–1992, although no lustration has ever taken place, and many of its members became top Russian officials. However, as the Soviet government was still opposed to market reforms, the economic situation continued to deteriorate. By December 1991, the shortages had resulted in the introduction of food rationing in Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{for the first time since}} World War II. Russia received humanitarian food aid from abroad. After the Belavezha Accords, the Supreme Soviet of Russia withdrew Russia from the Soviet Union on 12 December. The Soviet Union officially ended on 25 December 1991, and the Russian Federation (formerly the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) took power on 26 December. The Russian government lifted price control on January 1992. Prices rose dramatically, but shortages disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Like all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> of the Soviet Union, Armenia {{had its own}} {{flag and}} coat of arms. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Turkey in the 1950s, when Turkey objected to the {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but is located on Turkish territory, in the coat of arms. Turkey felt {{that the presence of}} such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, [...] "Why do you have a moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn't belong to Turkey, not even half the moon... Do you want to take over the whole universe?" [...] Turkey dropped the issue after this.|$|E
50|$|The memo {{argued that}} Tito further {{weakened}} the Socialist Republic of Serbia by dividing its territory and creating the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, {{which was not}} reciprocated in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Yugoslav <b>republics.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mutual {{encounters}} {{between the}} national teams {{of the two}} countries in many sports are followed by a majority of the populations, and the number of players and coaches active in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republic</b> is endless. Martin Lipták, a Slovak handball coach, successfully led the Czech national team to the EHF 2010 Handball European Championship in Austria. A Slovak team under his coaching, Tatran Prešov, won the Czech national league in 2008 and 2009. Czech ice hockey coach Vladimír Vůjtek led the Slovak national team to the silver medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship, having beaten the Czech team in the semifinals.|$|R
25|$|Soviet {{works that}} were first {{published}} in one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fourteen <b>republics</b> of <b>the</b> USSR and created by authors who did not become nationals of the Russian Federation were subject to the Russian copyright law per the Moscow agreement.|$|R
2500|$|In March 1989, {{the crisis}} in Yugoslavia deepened after the {{adoption}} of amendments to the Serbian Constitution which allowed the government of Serbia to dominate the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Until then, Kosovo and Vojvodina's decision-making had been independent and both autonomous provinces also had a vote at the Yugoslav federal level. Serbia, under newly elected President Slobodan Milošević, thus gained control over three out of eight votes in the Yugoslav presidency. With additional votes from Montenegro, Serbia was thus able to heavily influence {{the decisions of the}} federal government. This situation led to objections from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> and calls for the reform of the Yugoslav Federation.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the League of Prizren. Albanians felt that their status as a [...] "minority" [...] in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the [...] "nations" [...] of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a constituent republic, alongside <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> of Yugoslavia. Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed. In {{the aftermath}} of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded– including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{language}} in Ukraine {{is recognized as}} the language of a national minority but not as a state language. It is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine adopted by the parliament in 1996. Article 10 of the Constitution reads: [...] "In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed". The Constitution declares Ukrainian language as the state language of the country, while other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. The Ukrainian language was adopted as the state language by the Law on Languages adopted in Ukrainian SSR in 1989; Russian was specified as the language of communication with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> of Soviet Union. Ukraine signed the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages in 1996, but ratified it only in 2002 when the Parliament adopted the law that partly implemented the charter.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{the balance}} of power tipped {{significantly}} toward the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia declared their independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example), while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> twelve <b>republics</b> continued to discuss new, increasingly loose models for the Union.|$|R
50|$|Soviet {{works that}} were first {{published}} in one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fourteen <b>republics</b> of <b>the</b> USSR and created by authors who did not become nationals of the Russian Federation were subject to the Russian copyright law per the Moscow agreement.|$|R
5000|$|... 1793: During the War of the Pyrenees between Spain and the First French Republic, some French leaders {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a Catalan Republic twinned with France, as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Sister <b>Republics</b> created with the breakthrough of the French revolutionary army.|$|R
60|$|The second {{material}} of cement {{for their new}} republic is {{the superiority of the}} city of Paris: and this I admit is strongly connected with the other cementing principle of paper circulation and confiscation. It is {{in this part of the}} project we must look for the cause of the destruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions, ecclesiastical and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient combinations of things, as well as the formation of so many small unconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is evidently one great spring of all their politics. It is through the power of Paris, now become the centre and focus of jobbing, that the leaders of this faction direct, or rather command, the whole legislative and the whole executive government. Everything therefore must be done which can confirm the authority of that city over <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>republics.</b> Paris is compact; she has an enormous strength, wholly disproportioned to the force of any of the square republics; and this strength is collected and condensed within a narrow compass. Paris has a natural and easy connection of its parts, which will not be affected by any scheme of a geometrical constitution, nor does it much signify whether its proportion of representation be more or less, since it has the whole draft of fishes in its drag-net. The other divisions of the kingdom being hackled and torn to pieces, and separated from all their habitual means, and even principles of union, cannot, for some time at least, confederate against her. Nothing was to be left in all the subordinate members, but weakness, disconnection, and confusion. To confirm this part of the plan, the Assembly has lately come to a resolution, that no two of their republics shall have the same commander-in-chief.|$|E

50|$|In Soviet times, Prime Minister of the Russian SFSR (as {{well as the}} Prime Ministers of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Soviet <b>republics)</b> was {{appointed}} directly by the General Secretary of the CPSU, without the approval of candidacy with the Supreme Council of the USSR and RSFSR.|$|R
