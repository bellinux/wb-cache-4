5|$|Allocators are {{required}} to supply a <b>template</b> class member <b>template</b> [CODE] which enables the possibility of obtaining a related allocator, parameterized {{in terms of a}} different type. For example, given an allocator type IntAllocator for objects of type int, a related allocator type for objects of type long could be obtained using IntAllocator::rebind::other.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, {{and the advent of}} generic programming techniques pioneered by the Standard <b>Template</b> Library, the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In generic programming, it is often difficult or impossible to express types that depend on <b>template</b> parameters, in particular the return type of function <b>template</b> instantiations.|$|E

5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a <b>template</b> to recover the original information. Without access to a <b>template,</b> cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} <b>template</b> for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a <b>template.</b> DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

Scribe {{wanted to create a}} <b>template</b> for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any <b>template</b> in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their <b>template.</b> Polymerases are classified according to the type of <b>template</b> that they use.|$|E
40|$|Face {{detection}} is {{the first}} important step in many face image processing applications. Although {{a lot of work}} has been done on detecting frontal faces much less effort has been put into detecting faces with large image-plane or depth rotations. Most <b>templates</b> used in face detection are whole-face <b>templates.</b> However, such <b>templates</b> are ineffective for faces significantly rotated in depth. We propose to use half-face <b>templates</b> to detect faces with large depth rotations.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for the constraint-based {{synthesis}} of termination arguments for linear loop programs based on linear ranking <b>templates.</b> Linear ranking <b>templates</b> are parameterized, well-founded relations such that an assignment to the parameters {{gives rise to}} a ranking function. Our approach generalizes existing methods and enables us to use <b>templates</b> for many different ranking functions with affine-linear components. We discuss <b>templates</b> for multiphase, nested, piecewise, parallel, and lexicographic ranking functions. These ranking <b>templates</b> can be combined to form more powerful <b>templates.</b> Because these ranking <b>templates</b> require both strict and non-strict inequalities, we use Motzkin's transposition theorem instead of Farkas' lemma to transform the generated ∃∀-constraint into an ∃-constraint...|$|R

5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} <b>template</b> to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the <b>template</b> strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the <b>template</b> strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

40|$|Background: Preoperative total hip {{arthroplasty}} <b>templating</b> can {{be performed}} with radiographs using acetate prints, digital viewing software, or with computed tomography (CT) images. Our hypothesis is that 3 D <b>templating</b> is more precise and accurate with cup size prediction as compared to 2 D <b>templating</b> with acetate prints and digital <b>templating</b> software. Methods: Data collected from 45 patients undergoing robotic-assisted {{total hip arthroplasty}} compared cup sizes <b>templated</b> on acetate prints and OrthoView software to MAKOplasty software that uses CT scan. Kappa analysis determined strength of agreement between each <b>templating</b> modality and the final size used. t tests compared mean cup-size variance from the final size for each <b>templating</b> technique. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) determined reliability of digital and acetate planning by comparing predictions of the operating surgeon and a blinded adult reconstructive fellow. Results: The Kappa values for CT-guided, digital, and acetate <b>templating</b> with the final size was 0. 974, 0. 233, and 0. 262, respectively. Both digital and acetate <b>templating</b> significantly overpredicted cup size, compared to CT-guided methods (P <. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} between digital and acetate <b>templating</b> (PÂ =. 117). Interclass correlation coefficient value for digital and acetate <b>templating</b> was 0. 928 and 0. 931, respectively. Conclusions: CT-guided planning more accurately predicts hip implant cup size when compared to the significant overpredictions of digital and acetate <b>templating.</b> CT-guided <b>templating</b> may also lead to better outcomes due to bone stock preservation from a smaller and more accurate cup size predicted than that of digital and acetate predictions.
