40|$|Human {{presence}} influences {{survival of}} large carnivores {{in several ways}} and even outdoor activities can {{be a source of}} disturbance. As ungulate prey provide the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) with food for several nights and the pattern of lynx activity is mainly shaped by searching for and consuming large prey, the need to move decreases strongly while the prey is eaten. However, during the day, human activity may drive lynx to move to safe shelters and habitat features such as dense vegetation may increase tolerance. In the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic), we found 116 prey killed by five GPS–collared lynxes. We tested whether the kill sites were located farther from roads or <b>tourist</b> <b>trails</b> than a set of randomly generated locations and whether presence of roads or <b>tourist</b> <b>trails</b> and habitat structure influenced the distance ‘kill site to daytime resting sites’. At night, with low human activity, lynxes did not avoid roads and even selected the surroundings of <b>tourist</b> <b>trails.</b> The distance ‘kill site to daytime resting sites’ correlated negatively with presence of habitat concealment and distance to <b>tourist</b> <b>trails,</b> suggesting that outdoor activities may have to be considered in lynx management plans...|$|R

2500|$|Western saddles are saddles {{originally}} designed to be used on horses on working cattle ranches in the United States.

The Western saddle has no padding of its own, and must be used with a saddle blanket or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse.

2500|$|Whether [...] "persons of quality" [...] or not, {{the primary}} allure for visiting strangers was neither moral edification nor {{the duty of}} charity but its {{entertainment}} value.

It became {{one of a series}} of destinations on the London <b>tourist</b> <b>trail</b> which included such sights as the Tower, the Zoo, Bartholomew Fair, London Bridge and Whitehall. Curiosity about Bethlem's attractions, its [...] "remarkable characters", including figures such as Nathaniel Lee, the dramatist, and Oliver Cromwell's porter, Daniel, was, at least until the end of the eighteenth-century, quite a respectable motive for visiting.|$|E
