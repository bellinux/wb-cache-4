5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presented}} about {{analysis of}} aiming technique in archery shooting for {{the enhancement of}} archery sports in Malaysia. Before this, engineering in sport was not popular as many people did not realize the important of engineering factors in sports. It was not discovered {{and most of the}} athletes depend on the experienced and their practice in order to achieve their target. This study will be focusing on <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> part and <b>the</b> factors that will affect <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> and concentration of the archery athletes. Based on this study, there are a few factors that will be determined to be the cause for the distraction of <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> phase. Corresponds to the project background and problem statements, it is decided that the objectives of the project are to analyse <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> techniques from archery athletes, to study the relationship between the heart rate and emotions with the performance and to relate <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time with <b>the</b> shot points. The results from the analysis of heart rate proved that lower heart rate will distribute to a higher score. From the biofeedback device, the emotions level showed a distraction to the performance of the athletes. The increase of stress level can cause a lower accuracy during <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> phase and will distribute to a lower score. For <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time, three parameters have been set up which are 3, 5 and 7 seconds. From this <b>aiming</b> time, <b>the</b> best total score is during <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time in 5 seconds...|$|R

This paper presents {{for the first time the}} spin 0, 1 / 2 and 2 [*]QNMs of a Kerr black hole and the gravitational and electromagnetic QNMs of the RN black hole calculated via <b>the</b> <b>AIM</b> and confirms results previously obtained using the CFM.
