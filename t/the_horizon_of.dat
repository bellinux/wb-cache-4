5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled Formidable ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour. As Formidable moved away, the remaining masts on Venerable collapsed and the ship grounded off Sancti Petri. There was concern in the British squadron that Moreno might counterattack the disabled ship, but the arrival on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> Audacious and Superb persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz. Hood was able to refloat Venerable on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize Saint Antoine. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.|$|E

25|$|Before 1947, {{events like}} Partition of Bengal in 1905, Foundation of Muslim League in 1906 and Unification of Bengali in 1911 {{inspired}} the Muslim community of Dhaka {{to establish a}} new identity in <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> literature.

25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, {{there is a}} way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{event horizon}} {{of a black}} hole may {{be thought of as a}} surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between {{escaping}} and falling back. The event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center. They are two different kinds of horizons—the horizon of a white hole is like <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> a black hole turned inside-out.|$|E
25|$|This {{idea was}} made more precise by Leonard Susskind, {{who had also}} been {{developing}} holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> a black hole is a complete description of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory {{was just such a}} holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.|$|E

25|$|People {{within a}} society {{normally}} led reclusive lives. They were rather isolated, without much {{contact with the}} outsiders such as the Shan-Burmans. Unlike others, Pu Tong Seal believed in traveling between places, {{in addition to being}} a very adventurous person, so he constructed a road adjoining Khuasak and Thangmual, initially known as Tong Seal Road. He often traveled to Aicik, Theizang, Kalay-Kabaw Valley, Kalaywa, beyond <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries during his prime time around 1340 A.D. Many centuries later, the same route became a highway between Sizang region and Kalay Kabaw valley.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> the Santana Formation, {{in which}} both fossils were found, {{resulted}} with very high probability from sedimentation in a flat lake, which was filled with fresh or brackish water. The fossil finds made so far create an ambivalent picture. The fossil insects which have been recovered are an indication for fresh water; the find of the turtle Santanachelys, which was adapted to seawaters, indicate a saltwater environment. One {{theory is that the}} site was a brackish lagoon, which was connected to the sea. The climate was tropical and corresponded to today's climate in Brazil to a large extent.|$|E

25|$|The fate of Israel is {{of central}} concern because Israel is the elect people of God through whom God's redemptive {{work is done}} in the world. However tragic human {{suffering}} is on the human plane, what happens to Israel is directly tied to its role as that nation to which God attaches His name and through which He will redeem man. He who strikes Israel, therefore, engages himself in battle with God and {{it is for this reason}} that the history of Israel is the fulcrum of human history. The suffering of others must, therefore, be seen in the light of Israel's suffering. The travail of man is not abandoned, precisely because Israel suffers and, thereby, God's presence is drawn into human history and redemption enters <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> human existence.|$|E
25|$|The emblem for the 2006 annual {{meetings}} of the IMF and the World Bank Group is gold in colour, with lines and a bud in the emblem. Gold is selected for the emblem {{as it relates to}} the financial sector and the country's contributions to the world economy. It exemplifies excellence and strength, which characterise Singapore as a regional business and financial centre. The tones point towards the increase in the wealth of the nations, with expanding richness and scope for the people. The bud may appear to represent the plurality of ideas and cultures at the event. It also symbolises the life in the city-state, that brings forth its potential for growth in the global market. With its curve, the spine depicts <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> the world. The stylised lines are the longitudes, to represent the connection of countries and world leaders at the {{annual meetings}}. Petals are to signify the unity of leaders to have a common goal at the meetings. The lines also depict the congruent roles countries have to achieve international cooperation for growth in the world.|$|E
25|$|While {{dialogue}} {{can involve}} {{two or more}} people having conversations about opposing view points, it is not dialectical {{because there is no}} thesis or antithesis. In dialetical debates, all parties engaged are trying to prove the other wrong (which is what modern day psychotherapy boils down to). Rather, dialogue is more of a fusion of horizons, to use Gadamer’s term. When Dasein engages in dialogue with others, his horizon effectively fuses with the horizons of others. These horizons are polyphonic (multi-voiced) and fuse {{for the sole purpose of}} achieving higher truth and understanding. Put differently, the horizons of two polyphonic individuals are fused together during dialogue in such a way that both horizons are influenced and edified as opposed to one winning out over the other, and as opposed to one horizon remaining the same while the other that is judged to be wrong, or could be, is changed. Hermeneutics states that fusing horizons with others involves memory and imagination. It is through dialogue that memory and imagination enables therapists to empathically envision (intropathy) <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>of</b> their clients and further fuse it with their own.|$|E

Other indicators include the unusually oblique architectural aspect of the church, which suggests that its depiction was intended to extend across to a sister wing – {{in a manner similar}} to the Master of Flemalle's Annunciation, and especially in van der Weyden's c. 1452 Braque Triptych, where continuity between the panels is especially emphasised.|$|E
