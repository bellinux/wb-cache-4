50|$|Dopamine, a known {{neurotransmitter}} {{responsible for}} mood cycling, {{has been shown}} to have increased transmission during the manic phase. The dopamine hypothesis states that the increase in dopamine results in secondary homeostatic down regulation of key systems and receptors such as an increase in dopamine mediated G protein-coupled receptors. This results in decreased dopamine <b>transmission</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the depressive phase. The depressive phase ends with homeostatic up regulation potentially restarting the cycle over again.|$|E
50|$|Optical filters {{selectively}} transmit {{light in}} a particular range of wavelengths, that is, colours, while blocking the remainder. They can usually pass long wavelengths only (longpass), short wavelengths only (shortpass), or a band of wavelengths, blocking both longer and shorter wavelengths (bandpass). The passband may be narrower or wider; the transition or cutoff between maximal and minimal transmission can be sharp or gradual. There are filters with more complex <b>transmission</b> <b>characteristic,</b> for example with two peaks rather than a single band; these are more usually older designs traditionally used for photography; filters with more regular characteristics are used for scientific and technical work.|$|E
50|$|The {{collector}} resistors can {{be replaced}} by a current mirror, whose output part acts as an active load (Fig. 3). Thus the differential collector current signal is converted to a single ended voltage signal without the intrinsic 50% losses and the gain is extremely increased. This is achieved by copying the input collector current from the right to the left side where the magnitudes of the two input signals add. For this purpose, the input of the current mirror is connected to the right output and the output of the current mirror is connected to the left output of the differential amplifier.The current mirror inverts the right collector current and tries to pass it through the left transistor that produces the left collector current. In the middle point between the two left transistors, the two signal currents (current changes) are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (ΔI - (-ΔI) = 2ΔI) and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. Fig. 4 shows the <b>transmission</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this circuit.|$|E
