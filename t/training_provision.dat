[...] The building, completed in 1937, has had this function only since 1996; it was constructed by renowned cinema architect Robert Cromie [...] as a private house for Ian Stuart Millar, an eccentric iron industry tycoon, who occupied it for only nine years.

40|$|Current {{tertiary}} education and <b>training</b> <b>provisions</b> are designed mainly {{to meet the}} learning needs of those preparing for entry into employment and specific occupations. Yet, changing work, new work requirements, an ageing workforce and the ongoing need for employability across lengthening working lives make it imperative that this educational focus be broadened to include continuing education and <b>training</b> <b>provisions</b> for those already in the workforce. To address this refocusing of the education and training effort, this paper proposes that learning at work, encompassing practice-based experiences supported by both formal and informal workplace arrangements, constitute an effective {{continuing education and training}} model for worker-learners in the aged care industry. It draws on data from semi-structured interviews and written responses from 51 workers who show preferences for such a model. Not only do aged care workers like engaging in learning independently and with co-workers and workplace facilitators, they prefer a larger component of courses to be delivered at the work site. The implications of these findings are summarised in this article. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional StudiesFull Tex...|$|R

To establish the effectiveness of <b>training</b> and <b>provision</b> of assistive devices in preventing and treating LBP an update of a Cochrane literature re-view was performed to November 2010. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies with a concur-rent control group (CCTs) were included. Nine RCTs (20. 101 employees) and nine CCTs (1280 employees) were included for prevention: six {{more than in the}} previous version. No study on treatment was found. None of the in-cluded RCTs and CCTs provided evidence that <b>training</b> and <b>provision</b> of assistive devices prevented LBP when compared to no intervention or another intervention...|$|R
