50|$|Car dealerships are one {{business}} sector where part exchange deals are common. They are less common in other sectors. In the housing sector, for example, {{only a few}} businesses will make part exchange deals. One such is Barratt Homes, where the part exchange deal, with buyers being offered discounts for part exchange of their old houses, has in fact been {{an integral part of}} the company's business model. There is another accounting nicety for the house builder in such deals, relating to when, exactly, to take the profit on the deal. House prices change over time, and it is possible that the housebuilder may not be able to eventually sell the old, exchanged, property for the same or more than the value that it was originally exchanged for. There are two extreme views on how <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts</b> for such deals, and most accounting practices fall somewhere in the spectrum in between. The one extreme has the profit on the deal taken straightaway that the new house is sold, on the presumption that the old house will sell for its exchange value. The other extreme has the profit on the deal not taken at all until the entire deal has completed, including the sale onwards of the old house received in exchange. The major accounting considerations are making provisions at year's end for part exchange stock that remains unsold, and for the predicted marketing costs of selling it.|$|E
50|$|But Henry {{was still}} wary of Robert {{and placed his}} {{followers}} in key positions in Normandy. In the rebellion of 1110-12 barons on the frontier of Normandy were disgruntled over Henry's policies and especially his attempt to take custody of William Clito, son of Robert Curthose. According to Orderic, Robert {{played a central role}} in this rebellion after the death of Elias I, Count of Maine in July 1110. In 1112 Robert was sent as an envoy of the French king to Henry I at his court at Bonneville to negotiate the release of Robert Curthose, whereas Henry seized Robert and imprisoned him. Apparently Henry had charges already prepared; failing to attend Henry at his court after being summoned three times, of failing <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts,</b> and of acting against his lord's interests. Technically Robert may have been guilty but arguably it was not safe for him to attend Henry, he may have regarded the revenues as gifts and it is also arguable whether the charge of acting against Henry's interests warranted the severity of the punishment. In addition Robert was under the king's protection as an emissary sent to negotiate Robert Curthose's release. This gave the act international implications but at the time Louis VI of France and Henry I were intriguing against each other so the breach of protocol went unpunished. But with Robert's imprisonment the rebellion against Henry collapsed. Robert spent the rest of his life as a prisoner; the exact date of his death is not known.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the same}} issues were {{discussed}} again in the decree of Robert de Stretton, dated 12 January 1358, following a visitation in 1357. It seems that the nuns were partial to taking trips to Lichfield: they were warned {{not to do so}} without permission from the prioress. They were to be accompanied by two other nuns and were not to tarry in the town. Further, nuns were not to leave the precincts of the priory at all without permission, although the custom of taking the air together was commended. No secular women should have been living on the premises without the bishop's permission and any so doing were to leave by the next Feast of the Purification (2 February). The same applied to unauthorised children: with the bishop's permission each nun was allowed to keep one child for education, but males over seven years were excluded. The bishop demanded that nuns keep the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and the prioress was to report breaches to him. The prioress and officials were <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts</b> at least annually to the convent. Separate food rations had proved uneconomic and all the nuns were to eat together in the prioress's hall. Except in case of sickness, the only fire was to be in the building housing the Gesthall or infirmary. Monastic property could not to be granted away without the bishop's permission and any unauthorised grants were invalid. The decree itself was to be read out and explained in English by a literate cleric on the day after it was received.|$|E

40|$|In an accounting-financial {{perspective}} {{applied to}} business organizations, the Going-Concern Principle presupposes their sustainability towards perpetuity, influencing and guaranteeing investors’ returns. In Public Management, {{this is no}} different, underlining {{the existence of the}} Going-Concern Principle of the State. This describes the State as a political society that, like the company, should be perennial and sustainable, always aiming for the promotion of the common good and the development of its people. In line with the expected contribution, this paper is aimed at discussing the importance of Accounting Applied to the Public Sector as a useful tool for effective Public Governance and Governability, in accordance with a sustainability view that is applicable to the management of the State. What the method is concerned, regarding the ends, it was an exploratory and explanatory research and, regarding the means, bibliographic and documentary research and theoreticalempirical observation were used, focusing on compliance with Public Management disclosure (transparency) and accountability (social responsibility <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts</b> to society). As a result, a strong interrelation between the terms was verified, as Accounting evidences governments’ results and actions based on governance (the means/the how) related to governability (political power and actions), and also that both are oriented towards the sustainability of the State. As regards the latter, it was also verified that it is more comprehensive than the term “sustainability” itself, which is often narrowed down to the eco-environmental view and ignores important financial (equilibrium) and economic-social variables inherent in the social function of the State Como...|$|E

40|$|According to {{municipal}} {{law of the}} Early Modern Period a tutelage of an orphanusually ended in two ways: when the orphan reached the full-age or died before. Less frequent reason for ending a tutelage was depriving the tutor of his duties because of faults {{in the administration of}} orphans´ heritage. In the case that a widow-woman happens to be the tutor of the children, we speak about tutela anomala. This kind of tutelage was usually ended after her new marriage. In that case usually, at least in practice, either an adult son of the family or widow's new husband became the tutor. The duty of every tutor, {{with the exception of the}} so called powerful-father tutor, was <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts</b> to the orphan at the end of the tutelage and, in the case of his fault, to pay deficiency. After that the orphan becomes a full-fledged owner of the iherited property. In practice, however, the process of getting the money back to the full-aged child, whether it had been placed on deposit at the townhall or at the tutors', usually protracted for many years. Thelaw was also concerned with money lent at interest during the period of tutelage. The full-aged orphan could not take his/her property all at once, but in installments, into which the loan was divided. The tutor did not profit unless the child, or all the children, have died, in that case the tutor was entitled to the third part of the orphan's heritage. According to the law tutor is not entitled to any remuneration, the performance of this duty was therefore probably primarily a matter of personal honor and self-presentation...|$|E

The {{present research}} investigated how Non-Governmental Entities in Rio Grande do Sul are proceeding <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>accounts</b> to the funding agencies {{as well as}} to society in general; especially in relation to the resources they are trusted with in order to de-velop their projects. In theoretical terms, the study relates to the Accountability theme which vests itself with fundamentals such as transparency, rendering of accounts, participation and accountability in relation to acts performed by different agents, whether public, private or those of civil society. The practice of accountability takes place with the rendering of accounts conducted by economic and social agents in relation to the actions they have developed. In the case of NGOs, the rendering of accounts is offered to sponsors, collaborators {{as well as to}} general society, and the referred action should be based on the alluded conceptual fundamentals. In order to obtain the data on the usage of these practices by NGOs, the chosen technique was that of data collection through semi-structured interviews, which were applied to managers on a sample of 18 NGOs based in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre - RS. The criterion for choosing the sample was basically the accessibility to the indi-viduals to be researched. Through the data gathering instrument, aspects related to the general characteristics of NGOs were investigated: management tools for moni-toring economic and financial control, and the management structure they used; sus-tainability through resource obtainment mechanisms; the adoption of the accountabil-ity concept on governance practice as means to demonstrate the rendering of ac-counts to various publics. The data collected were subjected to a descriptive analy-sis, in which the percentage of usage degrees was calculated, based on the re-sponses obtained, which were categorized on the Likert scale. In addition, a qualita-tive analysis of the transcript of the answers to the open questions was held. The analysis made it possible to identify that the NGOs which have been studied work in areas that should be served by the state. Although the organizations have a manage-rial structure rather reduced, they show the adoption of management practices in ac-cordance with the principles of accountability, rendering accounts to the sponsor and disclosing their actions to society in general. The practice of economic and financial management, in the majority of the surveyed NGOs, is accomplished by monitoring their budgetary performance, being the decision making process explained to col-laborators. Still, limitations in terms of management process as well as in accoun-tancy and financial control can be perceived in some of the surveyed NGOs. The most evident aspect of the interviews is the constant concern for the continuity of the organization regarding its sustainability...|$|E
