5|$|<b>The</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> {{was another}} {{uncertainty}} for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one offensive lineman, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. <b>The</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in on the line. To fill the holes on <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line,</b> two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> (OL) {{consists}} of several players whose primary {{function is to}} block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> is the center (C), {{who is responsible for}} snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions open on <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b> By {{the start of}} the Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E
50|$|The New England Patriots' {{line was}} {{selected}} as <b>the</b> NFL's best <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> for <b>the</b> 2010 regular season. The five finalists in 2010 were <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>lines</b> of <b>the</b> Atlanta Falcons, Kansas City Chiefs, New England Patriots, 2009 winners New Orleans Saints and the New York Giants. <b>The</b> Patriots' <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> consisted of: starting Tackles Matt Light and Sebastian Vollmer, starting Guards Dan Connolly and Logan Mankins, starting Center Dan Koppen and backups Mark LeVoir (T), Stephen Neal (G), Rich Ohrnberger (G/C), Quinn Ojinnaka (T/G) and Ryan Wendell (C). Behind their powerful <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> <b>the</b> Patriots {{led the league in}} points per game (32.4), ranked 4th in sacks allowed (25), finished 8th in average yards (363.8), ranked 9th in average rushing yards (123.3) and ranked 11th in passing yards per game (240.4).|$|R

5|$|The 1919 {{season began}} with high expectations; World War I was over, and key players had {{returned}} from service. However, things did not go Warner's way; {{at the beginning of}} the season, problems with <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff did see some changes. The biggest change came at the offensive coordinator position. Former offensive coordinator Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive coordinator after previously serving as the co-offensive coordinator along with Long as well as <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a graduate assistant before taking a position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive coordinator with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Tech {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ken Oxendine and Dwayne Thomas. Thomas was a fifth-year senior who {{accumulated}} 673 rushing yards and seven touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury. Opening {{the field for the}} Tech rushing attack was <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> led by center Bill Conaty, who played in the Sugar Bowl despite a leg fracture suffered in Tech's final regular-season game. Conaty underwent surgery and played despite not being fully healed.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Zierlein gained {{his first}} NFL {{experience}} with the Cleveland Browns. He served for four seasons as <b>the</b> Browns' <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach under <b>the</b> Butch Davis regime. Zierlein's current Pittsburgh Steelers colleague Bruce Arians served as <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> coordinator for <b>the</b> first three of Zierlein's seasons at Cleveland. He returned from a one-year absence from football in 2006 as <b>the</b> assistant <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach for <b>the</b> Buffalo Bills under Dick Jauron.|$|R
5000|$|Tuinei {{was a key}} {{member of}} <b>the</b> Cowboys <b>offensive</b> <b>line,</b> helping <b>the</b> team win Super Bowl XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX, along with the NFC East Division in 1985 and from 1992 to 1996. His role in some of <b>the</b> {{greatest}} <b>offensive</b> <b>lines</b> in NFL history was detailed in the 2013 NFL Network's film A Football Life: [...] "the Great Wall of Dallas".|$|R
5|$|Also {{benefiting from}} <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line's</b> {{strength}} was Tech quarterback Bryan Randall. Randall finished {{the regular season}} with 1,957passing yards and 12passing touchdowns, completing 140 of his 225passes during the process. He also was successful running the ball, carrying it for 527yards and three touchdowns during the regular season.|$|R

5|$|After his {{football}} career ended, Slater worked with an ABC affiliate in Los Angeles. He participated {{as a guest}} coach during St. Louis Rams training camps in the early 2000s. On February 16, 2006, Oakland Raiders head coach Art Shell hired {{him to become a}} co-offensive lineman coach along with Irv Eatman. Slater was hired to mentor Robert Gallery, moving him to left tackle. Gallery struggled that season and Slater was released by the Raiders for the 2007 season and replaced by Tom Cable. He is currently <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, California.|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC.

5|$|Due {{to varying}} {{circumstances}} throughout the season, several players were rotated {{in and out}} of starting positions throughout Alabama's depth chart. Below is a listing of at what times during the season players were substituted as starter or saw increased playing time. On the offensive side of the ball, freshman Grant Hill split time with starter Austin Shepherd at right tackle against Kentucky. Kellen Williams was listed on the depth chart as a backup at left tackle and guard; however, coach Saban mentioned Williams as being the sixth starter who can fill in at all <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> positions. After the Ole Miss, Williams was listed as the back-up center to Chad Lindsay after an injury to starter Ryan Kelly.|$|E
5|$|For Georgia, {{discussion}} {{centered on}} the play-calling duties of assistant coach Mike Bobo. Bobo had been named the temporary offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs after then-assistant coordinator Neil Calloway had been named the new head coach at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Calloway would remain with the Bulldogs as <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach during the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Bobo would take over his role as offensive coordinator for the game. It was {{only the second time}} that Bobo performed as a play-caller for the Bulldogs, the previous game having come in Georgia's regular-season closer, a 15–12 win against Georgia Tech.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a {{draft pick}} to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry Walters and {{defensive}} end Jim Heighton. The retirement of the Buddy Brown left the Blue Bombers {{looking for an}} offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role {{on the right side}} of <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b> Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on the offense. He returned to the defensive line in 1980 and alternated between the offense and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981.|$|E
5|$|Protecting both quarterbacks was {{a strong}} {{offensive}} line anchored by All-American guard Rodney Hudson, a two-time winner of the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, a four-time recipient of all-conference honors and {{a finalist for the}} Outland Trophy. Hudson and <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> also protected Florida State's running backs. Foremost among these was sophomore Chris Thompson, who led the team with 687rushing yards. Thompson was predicted to start the ACC Championship game because of his performance in the regular season and because fellow running backs Ty Jones and Jermaine Thomas were injured. Taken together, Florida State's offense was 52nd in total offense, accumulating 391yards per game.|$|E
5|$|The {{injuries}} that had plagued USC {{throughout the season}} continued as All-American tackle Sam Baker left the game because of a hamstring strain and freshman guard Zack Heberer, already substituting for an injured Chilo Rachal, suffered a shoulder bruise. On the defense, linebacker Rey Maualuga suffered a hip injury and safety Kevin Ellison broke his nose. An uncommon number of injuries, especially along <b>the</b> <b>offensive</b> <b>line,</b> depleted reserve players and forced Trojans {{to reach out to}} the general student population in order to find students with previous lineman experience to help on the scout team's offensive line; however, none were officially added to the roster.|$|E
