5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of what anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E

25|$|Fallon insisted in the {{foreword}} {{that he had}} complete discretion on what {{to include}} and how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it,</b> excluding only some private family matters. While giving great detail on some business matters, the book says almost nothing about O'Reilly's children and little of his second wife. It gives considerable detail on business matters, and does question some of O'Reilly's assertions, notably about his Irish business interests. It also gives much detail on O'Reilly's parents' situations and especially his father's family, detail which the author notes even O'Reilly did not have until the book gathered it, and includes some fine detail about his residences.|$|E
25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E

And {{there is no way}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it.</b> The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible again." [...] After winning the pennant, the Giants lost to the Yankees in the World Series four games to two. The Brooklyn Dodgers rebounded to win the National League pennant in 1952, but lost the 1952 World Series to the Yankees four games to three.|$|E

500|$|Foster et al. {{conclude}} that {{whether or not}} a massacre occurred on the scale of that detailed in some versions of the story, the fact that people continue <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> is indicative of a [...] "deep unease about the communal memory of frontier history" [...] in South Australia. They observe that the story {{has become something of a}} [...] "narrative battleground" [...] between those who are sympathetic to the situation Aboriginal people found themselves in on the frontier, and those that wish to boast about how [...] "bold, resolute and resourceful" [...] early settlers were in dealing with the threats Aboriginal people posed to settlement. There is a conservative estimate of 80 settler deaths in South Australia during the frontier wars, with a highly speculative estimate of an Aboriginal death toll between 400 and 800.|$|E
500|$|Before Romeo meets Juliet, {{he loves}} Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He {{describes}} her as wonderfully beautiful: [...] "The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun." [...] Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: [...] "She hath forsworn to love, {{and in that}} vow / Do I live dead that live <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> now." [...] This {{is the source of}} his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: [...] "That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad." [...] Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like [...] "a crow" [...] alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: [...] "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night." [...] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.|$|E
500|$|During {{the siege}} of Bulawayo, these two men rode many times into the Matopos Hills on patrol, {{and it was in}} these hills that Burnham first {{introduced}} Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the Native Americans, and taught him [...] "woodcraft" [...] (better known today as Scoutcraft). Baden-Powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking, but from Burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map, how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals, and the many techniques for finding potable water. So impressed was Baden-Powell by Burnham's Scouting spirit that he closely listened to all he had <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>It</b> was also here that Baden-Powell began to wear his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief, like those worn by Burnham, for the first time. Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that the British Army needed to adapt. During their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. In Africa, no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham.|$|E

500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it.</b> To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert was very enthusiastic giving the film four out of four stars and wrote [...] "It took imagination <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it,</b> courage to film it, thought to act it, and from the audience it requires a brave curiosity about the peculiarity of obsession."
