When Ronald Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the AMT was expanded to target middle class deductions related to having children, owning a home, or living in high tax states. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report highlighted the AMT as the single most serious problem with the tax code. The advocate noted that {{the complexity of the}} AMT leads to most <b>taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> owe AMT not realizing it until preparing their returns or being notified by the IRS.|$|E
25|$|The British {{controlled}} India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh) {{either directly}} through the British Raj or indirectly through local princes. The colonial government of India supported the war enthusiastically, and enlarged the British Indian army {{by a factor}} of 500% to 1.4 million men. It sent 550,000 overseas, with 200,000 going as labourers to the Western Front and the rest to the Middle East theatre. Only a few hundred were allowed to become officers, but there were some 100,000 casualties. The main fighting of the latter group was in Iraq, where large numbers were killed and captured in the initial stages of the Mesopotamian campaign, most infamously during the Siege of Kut. The Indian contingent was entirely funded by the Indian <b>taxpayers</b> (<b>who</b> had no vote and no voice in the matter).|$|E
25|$|Personal {{income tax}} is often {{collected}} on a pay-as-you-earn basis, with small corrections made {{soon after the}} end of the tax year. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for <b>taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> have not paid enough during the tax year; and tax refunds from the government for those who have overpaid. Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{performance}} overall {{suffered as}} a result of the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions. Real GDP growth averaged a mediocre 1.8% from Q1 2001 to Q4 2008. Job creation averaged 95,000 private sector jobs per month, measured from February 2001 to January 2009, the least of any President since 1970. Job creation during the 2001-2007 period was slow by historical standards and arguably unsustainable, as nearly all the net job creation was reversed during the subsequent Great Recession. The employment recoveries from both the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions were protracted; the peak employment level for private sector workers in January 2008 was not regained until 2014. Income inequality continued to worsen pre-tax (a trend since 1980) and was accelerated after-tax by the Bush tax cuts, which dis-proportionally benefited higher-income <b>taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> pay the majority of income taxes.|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{under the}} current system who {{accumulated}} savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved {{under the current}} system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some <b>taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Credit for {{adoption}} expenses: [...] a credit up to $10,000, phased out at higher incomes. <b>Taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> have incurred qualified adoption expenses in 2011 may claim either a $13,360 credit against tax owed or a $13,360 income exclusion if the taxpayer has received payments or reimbursements {{from his or}} her employer {{for adoption}} expenses.

2500|$|Tax Credits: Tax credits {{can remove}} {{a portion of}} the income tax owed to the state by the {{production}} company, but since most production companies are limited purpose business entities they often incur very little, if any tax liability. [...] The use of the word [...] "tax credit" [...] or [...] "tax rebate" [...] often results in public confusion, as they layperson may think the program is a refund of taxes paid by the production, when it is actually based on a significant percentage of the production's actual spend and the amount is awarded regardless of whether the entity pays taxes (which they generally do not) (as explained by Louisiana's Chief Legislative Economist: “It’s {{got nothing to do with}} tax...We’re just using the tax-filing process and the Department of Revenue as the paying agent for a spending program. That’s what we’re doing.”) [...] Production companies must often meet minimum spending requirements to be eligible for the credit. [...] Of the 28 states that offer tax credits, 26 make them either transferable or refundable. [...] Transferable credits allow production companies that generate tax credits greater than their tax liability to sell those credits to other <b>taxpayers,</b> <b>who</b> then use them to reduce or eliminate their own tax liability. Refundable credits are such that the state will pay the production company the balance in excess of the company's owed state tax.|$|E
2500|$|Henry worked {{together}} with James Madison, a delegate {{after three years}} in Congress, on a [...] number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches. [...] Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation {{between church and state}} that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that <b>taxpayers</b> <b>who</b> were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, [...] "the general assessment plan {{is one of the main}} reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history." [...] The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons—his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County—but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.|$|E

6000|$|Let {{me point}} out to you that at this present moment it passes the wit of man, so far as I know, to give a legal {{definition}} of technical education. If you expect to have an Act of Parliament with a definition which shall include all {{that ought to be}} included, and exclude all that ought to be excluded, I think you will have to wait a very long time. I imagine the whole matter is in a tentative state. You don't know what you will be called upon to do, and so you must try and you must blunder. Under these circumstances it is obvious that there are two alternatives. One of these is to give a free hand to each locality. Well, it is within my knowledge that there are a good many people with wonderful, strange, and wild notions as to what ought to be done in technical education, and {{it is quite possible that}} in some places, and especially in small places, where there are few persons who take an interest in these things, you will have very remarkable projects put forth, and in that case the sole court of appeal for those <b>taxpayers,</b> <b>who</b> did not approve of such projects, would be a court of law. I suppose the judges would have to settle what is technical education. That would not be an edifying process, I think, and certainly it would be a very costly one. The other alternative is the principle adopted in the bill of last year now abandoned. I don't say whether the bill was right or wrong in detail. I am dealing now only with the principle of the bill, which appears to me to have been very often misunderstood. It has been said that it gave the whole of technical education into the hands of the Science and Art Department. It appears to me nothing could be more unfounded than that assertion. All I understand the Government proposed to do was to provide some authority who should have power to say in case any scheme was proposed, [...] "Well, this comes within the four corners of the Act of Parliament, work it as you like;" [...] or if it was an obviously questionable project, should take upon itself the responsibility of saying, [...] "No, that is not what the Legislature intended; amend your scheme." [...] There was no initiative, no control; there was simply this power of giving authority to decide upon the meaning of the Act of Parliament to a particular department of the State, whichever it might be; and it seems to me that that is a very much simpler and better process than relegating the whole question to the law courts. I think that here, or anywhere else, people must be extremely sanguine if they suppose that the House of Commons and the House of Lords will ever dream of giving any local authority unlimited power to tax the inhabitants of a district for any object it pleases. I should say that was not in the range of practical politics. Well, I put that before you as a matter for your consideration.|$|E
