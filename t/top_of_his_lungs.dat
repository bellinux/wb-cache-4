5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the style}} is embraced enthusiastically by the {{religious}} Zionist movement, including Gush Emunim, it {{is not without its}} opponents within the Haredi community.

2500|$|Blog Critics {{reviewer}} Jordan Richardson, {{in reviewing}} the album Metamorphosis states, [...] "'Live This Down' kicks a little ass as a pretty catty revenge tune and 'Hollywood Whore' works well enough on similar ground." [...] Reviewer Dan Marsicano also speaks favorably of the song in his review of the album, stating, [...] "After a short instrumental, 'Change Or Die' hits the speakers with a blast of rock {{that can only be}} described as a firm kick in the ass... 'Hollywood Whore' continues this upward momentum with a hard-hitting tune that has Shaddix ranting about the glorification of the entertainment industry. 'Sorry, but the party’s over,' Shaddix yells at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs,</b> letting everybody know that Papa Roach is ready with gas can in hand to burn everything to the ground." [...] Press Association music reviewer Nick Howes says the song [...] "invokes memories of classic Mötley Crüe".|$|E

2500|$|The Gromble (voiced by Gregg Berger) – The Gromble is a teal monster {{with two}} blue-green tufts of hair, a beard and a tail. He wears a belt {{around his waist}} and a red [...] pump on each of his four feet. He {{is known for his}} quick temper, harsh punishments and keen {{awareness}} of the misbehavior of his students, in particular the main characters. He speaks with a seemingly calm, falsetto voice until whomever he is speaking with feels safe only to yell at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> when angered. While serving as the leader and principal of the dump, The Gromble teaches young monsters and evaluates them using the Viewfinder, a chair like projection device used to replay the scaring activities of students. Along with Ickis, {{he is one of the}} few monsters who can hear the Pool of Elders— the source of monster existence that is made of the very substance of fears.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continued}} {{absence of}} {{news from the}} expedition against Fort Caroline greatly concerned the Spaniards at St. Augustine. San Vicente, one of the captains who had remained behind, prophesied that Menéndez would never come back, and that the entire party would be killed. This impression was confirmed by the return of a hundred men made desperate by the hardships of the march, who brought with them their version {{of the difficulty of}} the attempt. On the afternoon of Monday, the 24th, just after the successful rescue of the French frigate, the settlers saw a man coming towards them, shouting at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs.</b> The chaplain went out to meet him, and the man threw his arms around him, crying, [...] "Victory, victory! the harbor of the French is ours!" [...] On reaching St. Augustine, Menéndez at once armed two boats to send to the mouth of the St. Johns after Jacques Ribault, to prevent his reuniting with his father or returning to France with the news of the Spanish attack; but, learning that Jacques had already sailed, he abandoned his plan and dispatched a single vessel with supplies to Fort San Mateo.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, James Taylor at Christmas was {{nominated}} for a Grammy Award. [...] In January 2008, Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including Luis Conte, Michael Landau, Lou Marini, Arnold McCuller, Jimmy Johnson, David Lasley, Walt Fowler, Andrea Zonn, Kate Markowitz, Steve Gadd and Larry Goldings. The resulting live-in-studio album, named Covers, was released in September 2008. The album forays into country and soul while being the latest proof that Taylor is a more versatile singer than his best known hits might suggest. The Covers sessions stretched to include [...] "Oh What a Beautiful Morning", from the musical Oklahoma, a song that his grandmother had caught him singing over and over at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> when he was seven years old. Meanwhile, in summer 2008, Taylor and this band toured 34 North American cities with a tour entitled James Taylor and His Band of Legends. An additional album, called Other Covers, came out in April 2009, containing songs that were recorded during the same sessions as the original Covers but had not been put out to the full public yet.|$|E

2500|$|Yeston {{was born}} in Jersey City, New Jersey. His English-born father, David, founded the Dial Import Corporation, an {{importing}} and exporting firm, and his mother, Frances, helped run the business. [...] But the family loved music. [...] His father sang English music hall songs, {{and his mother was}} an accomplished pianist. [...] Yeston noted in a 1997 interview, [...] "My mother was trained in classical piano, and her father was a cantor in a synagogue. [...] A lot of musical theatre writers have something in common. Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Kurt Weill – each one had a cantor in the family. When you take a young, impressionable child and put him at age three {{in the middle of a}} synagogue, and that child sees a man in a costume, dramatically raised up on a kind of stage, singing his heart out at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lungs</b> to a rapt congregation, it makes a lasting impression." [...] At age five, Yeston began taking piano lessons from his mother, and by age seven he had won an award for composition. [...] He attended the Yeshiva of Hudson County through grade eight. [...] Yeston's interest in musical theatre began at age ten when his mother took him to see My Fair Lady on Broadway. [...] At Jersey Academy, a small private high school in Jersey City, Yeston broadened his musical study beyond classical and religious music and Broadway show tunes to include jazz, folk, rock and roll, and early music. [...] He took up folk guitar, played vibraphone with a jazz group, and participated in madrigal singing.|$|E
