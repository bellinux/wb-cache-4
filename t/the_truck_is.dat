5|$|Mulder {{intends to}} track Druce's truck, {{which is on}} its way to Colorado. However, before he leaves, Deep Throat {{approaches}} Mulder at his apartment, offering the photo of a purported UFO at Fort Benning, Georgia. Mulder initially believes that Druce's truck is a decoy meant to distract him from the UFO, but discovers that Deep Throat's photo is a fake. When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits his deception and confirms that the earlier transmission was genuine. He also divulges that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> being used to transport an extraterrestrial biological entity, or E.B.E., that was recovered from the Iraqi crash site. Mulder and Scully escape their pursuers and head towards Las Vegas, the last known location of the truck.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> <b>is</b> sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{truck on}} frictionless, {{straight}} rails. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> stationary at position 0, {{but it is}} buffeted {{this way and that}} by random uncontrolled forces. We measure the position of the truck every Δt seconds, but these measurements are imprecise; we want to maintain a model of where <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> and what its velocity is. We show here how we derive the model from which we create our Kalman filter.|$|E
5000|$|... 6.5t Cargo <b>Truck</b> — <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> {{licensed}} built, {{based on}} Hino TC cab-over <b>truck.</b> <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> first cab-over <b>truck</b> in South Korea and became popular. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> targeted for transportation companies that mainly uses <b>the</b> expressway. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in 1972.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> {{created by}} SFX and PACE Motorsports in 2001, and <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> driven by Lupe Soza, who had {{previously}} owned and driven Warrior from <b>the</b> 80's. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> a huge success among kids primarily. The idea stuck around.|$|R
5000|$|Bulldozer has {{appeared}} in four Monster Jam World Finals. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> driven by Eldon DePew. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> driven by Guy Wood.|$|R
25|$|At {{each time}} step, a noisy {{measurement}} of the true position of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> made. Let us suppose the measurement noise v'k is also normally distributed, with mean 0 and standard deviation σ'z.|$|E
25|$|The queue begins outside, winding past a 2.5 ton Mercedes-Benz troop {{transport}} truck. This is {{the actual}} vehicle used in the desert chase scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. A small mining car near <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> a movie prop as well, used in the mine scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Guests also walk by a noisy steam-powered engine/generator set piece, which appears to power the lights strung deep into the temple.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{there is}} a lot of unpaid time, usually at a Shipper or Receiver where <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> idle {{awaiting}} loading or unloading. Prior to the 2010 HOS changes it was common for 4–8 hours to elapse during this evolution. CSA addressed this and incorporated legal methods for drivers and trucking companies to charge for this excessive time. For the most part, loading/unloading times have fallen into a window of 2–4 hours although longer times are still endured.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trucks</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debut studio album by the {{electronic}} rock band <b>The</b> <b>Trucks.</b> It <b>was</b> released in 2006 on Clickpop Records. <b>The</b> <b>Trucks</b> played Sasquatch! Music Festival in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Magnum Force was the {{successor}} to Bad Medicine, and was also campaigned by Van Loo. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> first Dan Patrick <b>trucks,</b> and <b>was</b> more successful than its predecessor. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> sold Brian Barthel in 1996, renamed Midnight Maniac with co-owner Don Williams and later became Little Tiger.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> {{carrying}} 44 seasonal {{farm workers}} engaged mainly in picking citrus crops in the region. [...] There were 25 or 26 fatalities among <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> occupants, {{and several others}} were injured. [...] Immediately after <b>the</b> collision, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> dragged by <b>the</b> train for about 200 m; bodies of accident victims were left scattered on the ground, with limbs missing.|$|R
25|$|In Article 3 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales) also {{describes}} {{that the}} national flag can be decorated with a special tie called a corbata (cravat). The corbata is composed of a bow, two ribbons of different length and both ribbons are attached with a golden tassel called fringe. The corbata {{is placed on the}} top of the flag at the point where <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is,</b> and the colours of the corbata match that of the national flag. Organizations and political parties can adopt their own corbatas, such as the National Action Party (PAN), which uses a white corbata with blue fringes.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} application, {{consider}} {{the problem of}} determining the precise location of a truck. The truck can be equipped with a GPS unit that provides {{an estimate of the}} position within a few metres. The GPS estimate is likely to be noisy; readings 'jump around' rapidly, though remaining within a few metres of the real position. In addition, since <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> expected to follow the laws of physics, its position can also be estimated by integrating its velocity over time, determined by keeping track of wheel revolutions and the angle of the steering wheel. This is a technique known as dead reckoning. Typically, the dead reckoning will provide a very smooth estimate of the truck's position, but it will drift over time as small errors accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, {{or on the}} {{shoulder}} of a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E

500|$|On a busy New York City street, Jones and {{his team}} use the energy cell to open a doorway into a {{parallel}} universe and bring a truck through, but are apparently unsuccessful, as Jones complains he used the [...] "wrong coordinates". Having previously observed Walter at the graveyard, The Observer (Michael Cerveris) arrives with Walter at the Bishops' beach house, and gives Walter a coin, telling him to remember {{what he has to}} find. Walter goes on alone into the house, while Olivia and Charlie interview witnesses who saw Jones extract the truck from the doorway. They discover that the truck's VIN numbers do not exist, which implies the [...] "truck was never made". A further interview with Nina reveals to the Fringe team that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> from another universe, and that Jones is using the stolen energy cell to travel to that universe.|$|E
2500|$|Since truck-driver {{language}} has no signal for [...] "Do not move {{in front of}} me," [...] nor has any understood length of time for turning headlights or high beams on or off, flashing the high-beams to say [...] "Do not move in front of me" [...] may be misinterpreted to mean that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> clear {{to proceed with the}} lane change in front of the vehicle giving the signal.|$|E

2500|$|Tony Molesky: Molesky is a 19-year {{veteran of}} the ice roads, and like Kromm, serves as a safety and driver {{instructor}} for Carlile. In the season premiere, he describes a recent accident {{in which he had}} to swerve into a ditch to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming rookie driver. His truck took a glancing blow, scattering debris which he later returns to pick up; by season's end, <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> repaired and put back in service.

2500|$|In 1987, Chevrolet started {{building}} {{a new generation of}} CUCV. The US Air Force initially bought small batches of these units, dubbed the CUCV II. Produced through 2001, CUCV IIs were basic civilian Chevrolet C/K, Tahoe, and Suburban units sent to another plant for [...] "militarization" [...] on special order. The trucks were originally white in color with gray vinyl interiors. They received CARC exterior paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color camouflage), a brush bar, a pintle hitch, towing/loading shackles, extra leaf springs to give them a 5/4 ton rating {{and a host of other}} small changes. All CUCV IIs have a 24 volt dual-battery starting system, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> 12 volt.|$|E

He took up as much room in walking the quarter-deck, as a ninety in waring; and <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> not driven on the head of that top-gallant-mast, half as hard as the hat is riveted to his head. The fellow has no reverence for a pennant! I managed, in shifting pennants at sunset, to make the fly of the one that came down flap in his impudent countenance, by way of hint; and he took it as a Dutchman minds a signal--that is, as a question to be answered in the next watch. A little polish got on the quarter-deck of a man-of-war, would make a philosopher of the rogue, and fit him for any company, short of heaven!" ...|$|E
