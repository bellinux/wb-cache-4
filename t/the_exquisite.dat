25|$|Don Dale, Style Weekly (May 21, 2001) — Maury Chaykin {{makes an}} {{excellent}} Nero Wolfe in A new series based on Stout’s books.

25|$|Anchiornis {{is a type}} of small, four-winged paravian dinosaur. The genus Anchiornis {{contains}} only the type species Anchiornis huxleyi, named for its similarity to modern birds. Anchiornis fossils have been only found in the Liaoning Province of China, in rocks dated to the late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. Anchiornis is known from hundreds of specimens, and given <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> preservation of some of these fossils, it became the first Mesozoic dinosaur species for which almost the entire life appearance could be determined, and an important source of information on the early evolution of birds.|$|E
25|$|Sterne's Writings, {{in which}} it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating {{plagiarist}} who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{church in}} the city and one of the oldest churches in Ukraine is the 5-domed Transfiguration Cathedral, {{commissioned}} in the early 1030s by Mstislav the Bold and completed several decades later by his brother, Yaroslav the Wise. The Cathedral of Sts Boris and Gleb, dating from the mid-12th century, was much rebuilt in succeeding periods, before being restored to its original shape in the 20th century. Likewise built in brick, it has a single dome and six pillars. The crowning achievement of Chernihiv masters was <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> Pyatnytska Church, constructed {{at the turn of the}} 12th and 13th centuries. This graceful building was seriously damaged in the Second World War; its original medieval outlook was reconstructed to a design by Peter Baranovsky.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} Buddhist guardian deities {{are frequently}} {{indicated by the}} animal vehicles of the particular gods, particularity on the guard stones. A good example is furnished by <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> statues {{on either side of}} the entrance to Abhayagiri Stupa. The head‑dress of one of the statues is a conch while that of the other is a lotus. Representing Sanka and Padma, the two principal treasure houses of Kuvera, they are believed to have been erected to ward off any evil or danger that might threaten the stupa or its precinct. Even at present they are commonly believed to be endowed with mystic powers, and courts of law in Anuradhapura accept swearing before the statues as evidence in settlement of minor disputes between litigants.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} palm of her hand. <b>The</b> <b>exquisite</b> stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E

25|$|While less {{studies have}} been {{completed}} examining deintensification in this setting, than in primary radical radiation for this cancer (see below), it {{is an area of}} active investigation. In one single institution study, a decision was made to reduce the radiation dose in high risk patients with HPV+OPC from 66 to 60Gy, corresponding to the actual evidence, and follow up has shown no decrease in cancer control. Current trials, both in North America and Europe (such as ECOG 3311 and PATHOS) use 50Gy as the comparison arm. The comparator of 50Gy was chosen on the grounds of (i) <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> sensitivity of HPV+OPC to radiation, both in vitro and in vivo; ECOG 1308 showing excellent disease control at 54Gy; and data suggesting that 50Gy in 1.43Gy (iso-effective dose 43Gy in 2.0Gy was sufficient to electively treat the neck. Other studies are evaluating doses as low as 30Gy in high risk cases.|$|E
25|$|Tomb and mosque of Isa Khan: Several monuments dot {{the pathway}} {{leading up to}} the tomb {{enclosure}} from the main entrance in the West. Prominent among them is one that pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years. Constructed in 1547 CE, it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals. The octagonal tomb is positioned within an octagonal garden, which was built during his own lifetime and the reign of Islam Shah Suri, son of Sher Shah. It later served as a burial place for the entire family of Isa Khan. On the western side of the tomb lies a three-bay wide mosque, in red sandstone. The octagonal tomb bears a striking resemblance to other tombs of the Sur dynasty monuments in the Lodhi Gardens, in Delhi and demonstrates a marked progression in the development of <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> architectural style of the main tomb. Some of the architectural details present here were seen later in the main Humayun's tomb, though on a much grander scale, such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure.|$|E

In November 2000, they, once more, met in Russia, in a concert that was staged in Grand Kremlin Palace’s George Hall.|$|E

They proved such a boon to navigation that they came into widespread use on ships. In the dedication of his 1595 book The Seamans Secrets to the Lord High Admiral, Charles Howard, the 1st Earl of Nottingham, navigator John Davis spoke of [...] "the mechanical practices drawn from the Arts of Mathematick, [...] our Country doth yield men of principal excellency", and he noted [...] "Mr Emery Mullenenx for <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> making of Globes bodies".|$|E
500|$|After the child's birth, Shelley {{wrote to}} Byron [...] "of <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> symmetry" [...] {{and beauty of}} [...] "a little being whom we ... call Alba, or the Dawn." [...] He asked Byron what his plans were for the child. Later, Shelley {{acknowledged}} the child's presence was becoming something of an embarrassment. Byron asked his half-sister Augusta Leigh to take Allegra into her household, but Leigh refused. Hostile to Clairmont and initially sceptical that he had fathered her daughter, Byron agreed to take custody of Allegra {{under the condition that}} her mother have only limited contact with her. Shelley warned Clairmont that this might not, after all, be the best plan for Allegra, but Clairmont hoped that her daughter would be more financially comfortable and would have a better chance at a good life if she lived with her father. [...] "I have sent you my child because I love her too well to keep her," [...] she wrote to Byron.|$|E
500|$|The song enjoyed long-standing popularity. Wyndham writes, [...] "Little maid of Arcadee" [...] was [...] "popular for {{a quarter}} of a century". Sullivan's first biographer {{suggested}} that [...] "Thespis will be best remembered by <b>the</b> <b>exquisite</b> musical setting to the simple little Gilbertian ballad". Several later commentators write favourably of the song. Walbrook finds it [...] "one of the neatest of Gilbert's ditties, packed with cynicism and slyness, expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness." [...] Goldberg says that it is [...] "dainty, simple and quite in the vein of Gilbert's words, to which, as in almost every later instance, Sullivan's setting provides an original rhythmic piquancy." [...] Fitz-Gerald considers it [...] "quite a forerunner of Gilbert at his easiest", while Dark and Gray call it [...] "a typically dainty Gilbertian love-song worthy to be compared to the best that he ever wrote." [...] Jacobs dissents: [...] "As music it is as trivial as Sullivan ever wrote." ...|$|E
