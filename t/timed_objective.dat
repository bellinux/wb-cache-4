[...] In Ride Levels, gameplay is set outdoors in Metropolis, and alternates between flying Superman {{through a series of}} colored rings and then completing a <b>timed</b> <b>objective,</b> such as protecting a civilian character or defeating all the enemies. When flying through a ring section, the player is given a time limit to complete the run that ranges from one to ten minutes. If the player misses three rings, runs out of time, or fails the <b>timed</b> <b>objective</b> that immediately follows, they must restart the ring section.|$|E

If this characteristics are not use, the difference in obtained results could be very significant. This characteristics can be space and time. The analyse a <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> functions for systolic arrays is very complex problem because the change of some space or other <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> function make influence on <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> functions.

50|$|Mists of Pandaria also {{included}} a new 3 player instance mode, called Scenarios. Playable on either normal or heroic difficulty, they are short stories players can play through and earn rewards at the end. The stories are mostly relevant to the Horde and Alliance storylines in Pandaria. Scenarios have different stages, and the players receive different tasks for each stage. During a heroic scenario, the players can attempt to complete a <b>timed</b> <b>objective</b> for an extra reward. The scenario mode doesn't require anyone to queue as a role, and it's up to the group what composition they want to run with.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{selecting}} a realtime recovery strategy or a Real-Time Recovery (RTR) solution, a disaster recovery planner should refer to their organization's {{business continuity plan}} which should indicate the key metrics of recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> Recovery <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> for various business processes (such as the process to run payroll, generate an order, e-mail, etc.). The metrics specified for the business processes must then be mapped to the underlying IT systems and infrastructure that support those processes.Once the recovery <b>time</b> <b>objective</b> and recovery point objective metrics have been mapped to IT infrastructure, the DR planner can determine the most suitable recovery strategy for each system. An important note here however is that the business ultimately sets the IT budget and therefore the RTO and RPO metrics need to fit with the available budget. While most business unit heads would like zero data loss and zero time loss, the cost associated with that level of protection historically have made high availability solutions impractical and unaffordable. The benefit of implementing a Real-Time Recovery solution is that the investment is substantially reduced from traditional tape based backup products.|$|R
