[...] Honda investigated the bike and discovered that the throttle mechanism had been defective and was stuck open at 26 degrees before the crash. Honda officially apologised to Stoner for the mechanical failure.|$|E

50|$|A {{centrifugal}} clutch {{is used in}} some vehicles (e.g., mopeds) and also in other applications where {{the speed of the}} engine defines the state of <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> for example, in a chainsaw. This clutch system employs centrifugal force <b>to</b> automatically <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> when <b>the</b> engine rpm rises above a threshold and to automatically disengage <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> when <b>the</b> engine rpm falls low enough. See Saxomat and Variomatic.|$|R
50|$|The P1 {{class engines}} were {{initially}} equipped with two-cylinder boosters {{attached to the}} trailing axle. These were engaged using a Westinghouse pump mounted on <b>the</b> boiler <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> cylinder <b>clutch.</b> These had a tractive effort of 8,500 lbf kN when used, increasing the tractive effort of the locomotive from 38,500 to 47,000 lbf kN. It was intended by Gresley these boosters {{would be used to}} assist the locomotive while starting and topping the banks over which they travelled.|$|R
2500|$|A new [...] "E-stick" [...] option {{combined}} {{a manual}} 3-speed transmission {{with an automatic}} clutch as a low-cost alternative to the fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a clutch pedal by using engine oil pressure and intake manifold vacuum <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> and disengage <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> when shifting gears.|$|R
50|$|When {{pulling away}} on an uphill slope {{the chance of}} {{stalling}} the engine is greater, {{and as a result}} it can be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> more slowly than normal while revving higher than normal.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the ST4s {{production}} was discontinued {{in favour of}} an ST3s variant which inherited the enhanced ST4s suspension components, but which kept the ST3 Desmotre motor unchanged. Reasons given for the ST4s' demise were that the 996 engine would not pass the stringent Euro-3 emissions standard, whereas the ST3 motor could pass the emissions tests. In 2004 and 2005, Ducati added a wet clutch to many models, including the ST series in 2005. This reduced the force necessary <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|In adverse road conditions, notably snow or ice, it is {{recommended}} to pull away in as high a gear as possible to minimize torque on the wheels and thereby maintain traction with the road. Pulling away requires progressively slower engagement of the clutch as the gear increases, and in a high gear it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> slowly to avoid the increased risk of stalling the engine, or, {{in the case of}} adverse weather conditions, spinning the wheels.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a controller development for an electro-mechanical friction clutch (EMFC) system for automotive applications {{and especially for}} vehicles that use continuously variable transmission. The work focuses on developing an EMFC engagement controller based on experimental work using a Proportional Derivative (PID) controller algorithm <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> dry friction <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> EMFC is electromechanically actuated using a DC motor system, such that a smooth engagement process can be performed satisfactorily. To develop the controller, the dynamic behaviors of the EMFC system are investigated by performing tests on the EMFC bench-test. Results from this experiment show {{that the percentage of}} slip between the input and output shaft of the EMFC system depends on the input speed and output torque. Therefore, by applying slip control, engagement of the EMFC can be controlled and achieved for any input speed and torque during the standing start of a vehicle...|$|R
50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} <b>engaged</b> when <b>the</b> two parts <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> (either gears or <b>clutches)</b> are at <b>the</b> same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is released (<b>engaged)</b> while in neutral. Some drivers use <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Other drivers will depress (disengage) <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> shift <b>to</b> neutral, then <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> momentarily <b>to</b> force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|A {{significant}} reason motorcycle drag racers lagged {{in implementing}} delay box electronics {{is due to}} the wide variety of driveline configurations on dragbikes. Of the successful bracket racing drag race cars, most had automatic transmissions equipped with transbrakes. Innovation quickly adapted the delay box to cars with dual line locks (devices which locked the brakes on all four wheels electrically), and manual transmissions {{with the use of a}} hydraulic throw out bearing to hold <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plates apart, and also adapted to dragbikes that used pneumatics or hydraulics to actuate <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> release, or centrifugal dragbike clutches known as [...] "slider clutches" [...] that <b>engage</b> with <b>the</b> engine's revolutions per minute (RPM) increase. When using a delay box on a motorcycle with a slider <b>clutch,</b> <b>the</b> engine RPM is electronically controlled (capped) by an electronic rev limiter connected to a delay box. When the delay box times out, the engine is allowed <b>to</b> freely rev-up <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and launching <b>the</b> motorcycle downtrack. As you can see, delay boxes can be used on both cars and motorcycles. A transmission brake is not required to use a delay box for drag racing. When racers were educated to this, and also shown ways to utilize delay boxes on motorcycles, there was some alleviation of the early controversy.|$|R

Stoner commented on the crash, [...] "I didn't have enough time <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> the throttle stuck.

50|$|The driver {{stood on}} a {{platform}} with 10-inch tires and operated the machine using only the handlebars and steering column, pushing them forward <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> using a lever on the handlebar to control the throttle, and pulling the handlebars and column back to disengage the clutch and apply the brake. After riding, the steering column would be folded onto the platform to store the scooter more easily. The engine was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, 155 cc engine over the front wheel. The bike came with a headlamp and tail lamp, a Klaxon horn, and a toolbox. Developed during wartime and gasoline rationing, it was quite efficient, but was not widely distributed. An electric version was also available with a motor on the front wheel.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the {{transmission input shaft}} and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine {{is equipped with a}} mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The {{input of}} <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> swing outward and force <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> <b>The</b> most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a <b>clutch</b> shoe. When <b>the</b> central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> shoes <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch disks stacked together like a motorcycle <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> weighted arms force these disks together and <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Situated {{on top of}} {{the rear}} {{differential}} is a high pressure, low volume electric pump. This pump pressurizes Normal ATF (0-288 psi) into the transfer case <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pack. This fluid only engages the clutch pack and does not mix with the NS-ATF lubricating the tranfercase. The higher the fluid pressure the transfer case is supplied with from the pump, the more the clutch pack engages, enabling the torque to the front wheels to be varied. Exiting the transfer case, the front drive shaft runs along {{the right side of the}} transmission, into a differential located on the right of the engines sump. This is a cast aluminum unit, with the sump and front differential made as a single unit that cannot be separated. The front right axle is shorter than the left, because the differential is closer to the right wheel. The front left axle runs through the engine's sump to the left wheel.|$|E
5000|$|... "The engine a {{sets the}} face plate b, {{which serves as}} the flywheel, into motion and the {{rotation}} is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd {{by means of the}} hand lever fastened {{to the left of the}} upper end of the steering column and the articulated lever f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the hand lever g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this hand lever the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front axle is straight, the rear axle is full-length and has no differential." ...|$|E
40|$|In 1992 the Haldex group bought Sigvard Johansson’s patent from 1988. The {{original}} design {{is based on}} a rotational speed difference dependent pump that creates a hydraulic pressure <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> that locks up the rotational difference. From the originally rather simple solution this has developed to gain in controllability and engagement speed to become a market leading system. The traction division of the Haldex group was recently sold to BorgWarner. When designing a four wheel drive system in a car the goal is to get the desired speed on all four wheels. For example, when cornering on pavement the requested speed of the rear wheels is lower than the speed of the front wheels, which requires the coupling between the differentials to allow speed differences. When trying to maintain a controlled slip during specific conditions vibrations may occur. The goal is to foresee when this will happen, create greater understanding and possibilities to avoid them. In later years the benefits with simulation has become more and more obvious, what to expect from a physical system and when to expect it. This {{is one of the major}} differences between high-end products and those built in a shed. The goals of this thesis are to •Create a dynamics model of the drive train. •Verify the simulated results and improve the simulation based on the testing results. •Make it possible to foresee when dynamic problems will occur and how to avoid them. A simplified model of the drive train was created in Simulink. Parts like drive shafts are assumed to be constant torsion beams and other components stiff; moment of inertia and damping were measured and taken in consideration. Friction models with various lubricants were created and implemented into the simulation. Both simulation and verification in testing rig were performed with data and driving case taken from a real car. The driving case was also used in a testing rig in order to verify the results and improve the simulation model. To be able to compare results from both methods the simulation was modified to the configuration of the rig. Thermal and friction models have been confirmed in rig testing and vibrations in the drive train have been linked to variations in sliding velocity. However when simulating a complex system, like the drive train of a car, there are lots of factors that affects vibrations, neither does rig testing with the very same setup give the same result every time. The simulation time is a big success since it takes less than a minute to simulate a simple drive case and if the user has an overview of the programming changes can be made easily without complications or error messages. The simulation instrument can be used to initially evaluate a new drive train setup or new friction characteristics of a friction system. Validerat; 20110524 (anonymous...|$|E
50|$|The ways {{in which}} a car can stall is usually down to the driver, {{especially}} on manual transmission. For instance if a driver <b>engages</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> too quickly while stationary then the engine will stall; <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> slowly will stop this from happening. Stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and/or change to neutral while coming to a stop. Stalling can be dangerous, especially in heavy traffic.|$|R
50|$|These {{superseded}} wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as teleprinters, {{including the}} Teletype Model 28 and its successors, {{using the same}} design principles. IBM Selectric typewriters also used them. These are typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped drive drum are two or three freely floating pawls arranged so that when <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is tripped, <b>the</b> pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a drum brake. When <b>engaged,</b> <b>the</b> load torque on each pawl transfers to the others <b>to</b> keep them <b>engaged.</b> These clutches do not slip once locked up, and they engage very quickly, {{on the order of}} milliseconds. A trip projection extends out from the assembly. If <b>the</b> trip lever <b>engaged</b> this projection, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> was disengaged. When the trip lever releases this projection, internal springs and friction <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> then rotates one or more turns, stopping when the trip lever again <b>engages</b> <b>the</b> trip projection.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more friction discs pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is released when <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> causes excessive <b>clutch</b> plate wear. <b>Engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> abruptly when <b>the</b> engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} cars are {{otherwise}} free-rolling. Winding them up {{requires them to}} be pushed downwards, <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> As <b>the</b> motor is only engaged for winding whilst held down, the complete winding must be completed in one pass, unlike the flywheel motor. A few motors have an internal one-way clutch that allows winding with a back-and-forth motion.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually, the {{turbopump}} for {{the engine}} was mechanically driven from outside.

50|$|Electrohydraulic manual {{transmission}} {{is a type}} of semi-automatic transmission system, which uses an automated clutch unlike conventional {{manual transmission}}s where the driver operates <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is controlled by electronic computers and hydraulics. To change gears, the driver selects the desired gear with the transmission shift lever, and the system automatically operates <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and throttle to match revs and <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> again. Also, many such transmissions operate in sequential mode where the driver can only upshift or downshift by one gear at a time.|$|R

50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip <b>the</b> mechanism, <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> between <b>the</b> power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate as}} one-way {{restrictor}} valves that limit {{the volume of}} fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm engagement without being too fast for the drive train to handle since clutches can quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> delay valve slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock {{in the event that}} an inexperienced driver quickly <b>engaged</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> at higher revs.|$|R

50|$|Clutch control {{refers to}} the act of {{controlling}} {{the speed of a}} vehicle with a manual transmission by partially <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate, using <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal instead of (or in conjunction with) the accelerator pedal. The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds. In <b>the</b> extreme, <b>clutch</b> control is used in performance driving, such as starting from a dead stop with the engine producing maximum torque at high RPM.|$|R
50|$|A {{friction}}-plate brake uses {{a single}} plate friction surface <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> {{input and output}} members of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Single face electromagnetic brakes make up approximately 80% {{of all of the}} power applied brake applications.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> {{mechanism}} uses {{dry plate}} carbon–carbon technology originally derived from aircraft brakes. Friction is only used <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> lift fan at low engine speeds. A mechanical lock-up is <b>engaged</b> before increasing <b>to</b> full power.|$|R
50|$|Typically with {{motorcycles}} and {{in motor}} sport, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is often used}} to facilitate the use of resistance from the engine spinning at high speeds to decelerate the vehicle more quickly, often accompanied with normal braking. This can be achieved by placing the vehicle in a gear that would ordinarily be too low for the current speed and momentum of the vehicle and by partly <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> When this happens momentum energy from the inertia of the vehicle is taken away to spin the engine {{as close as possible to}} its maximum capability. As the vehicle is decelerating <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> can be further released to transfer more energy to keep the engine spinning as quickly as possible. This method causes excessive clutch wear however, and it could cause severe engine damage or wheel lockup if <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> were released suddenly.|$|R
50|$|The idea {{of rapid}} {{shifting}} by clutch alone {{has also been}} developed as <b>the</b> dual <b>clutch</b> transmission, in recent high-performance cars. This combines the simplicity of a shifting gearbox with the rapid shifts of a clutch-based design. There are effectively two separate gearboxes, each offering alternate ratios from the overall set, and <b>the</b> two <b>clutches</b> select which gearbox is in effect. Changes within the gearbox are done automatically, to predict which ratio the driver will require next. Provided that the next ratio has been selected correctly (i.e. the computer guessed correctly as to an up-shift vs. a down-shift) the shift itself is merely a rapid movement of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Unexpected shifts may confuse the system though and it must first select the correct ratio before <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> giving a far slower shift.|$|R
