5000|$|Religious {{tensions}} arose {{once again}} in 1960 when the Democrats nominated John F. Kennedy, a Catholic who was elected. In 2004, with the nomination of John Kerry by the Democrats, who was {{at odds with the}} Church in <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and same-sex marriage, his Catholic religion failed to attract significant votes, as slightly more Catholics voted for George W.

25|$|The {{landmark}} {{judicial ruling}} of the Supreme Court in Roe v.

25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> Abbott {{has become}} a vocal ‘pro-choice’ supporter, {{opposing}} moves towards changing abortion counselling policy, and reducing the abortion time limit.

25|$|On July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court of the United States {{to replace}} Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement. The nomination proceedings were contentious from the start, especially over <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> and many women's groups {{and civil rights}} groups opposed Thomas {{on the basis of}} his conservative political views, as they had also opposed Bush's Supreme Court nominee from the previous year, David Souter.|$|E
50|$|Francis told La Civiltà Cattolica {{that the}} church {{does not need to}} speak {{constantly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> artificial contraception, and homosexuality. He thought that other <b>issues,</b> notably <b>the</b> duty to help those who are poor and marginalized, have been neglected. He added {{that the church}} had focused in trivial issues, and as such should not be so prone to condemn, and that priests should be more welcoming. He said the confessional should be used to motivate people to better themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{also wrote}} that [...] "it {{is not a}} debate on <b>the</b> wider <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> law - <b>issues</b> often {{labelled}} as 'pro-choice' and 'pro-life'". The consultation was closed on 17 January 2015.|$|R

Quinn calls herself [...] "a feminist and an activist and proud of it." [...] Sister Mary Ann Cunningham of Denver, a NCAN board member, says they are an alternative to the church hierarchy's positions on public <b>issues.</b> <b>The</b> organization supports the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.|$|R
25|$|Gregg has a {{moderate}} record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined {{six of his}} fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, {{he was among the}} breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.|$|E
25|$|Roe v. Wade, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} United States Supreme Court on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> It was decided simultaneously with a companion case, Doe v. Bolton. The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life. Arguing that these state interests became stronger {{over the course of}} a pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Hannan, as {{a retired}} archbishop, {{publicly}} opposed {{the election of}} Democrat Mary Landrieu, a Roman Catholic whose family had been Hannan's longtime friends, to the United States Senate. Although stopping short of endorsing (or even mentioning) Landrieu's Republican opponent, Woody Jenkins, the retired archbishop had become concerned, as he explained, by the endorsement of Landrieu by Emily's List, an organization devoted to pro-choice candidates on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Emily's List later ceased its support of Senator Landrieu prior to her 2002 re-election because of her congressional opposition to intact dilation and extraction (partial-birth abortion). Hannan's 1996 declaration has been cited as influential on later Catholic prelates involving themselves in politics by issuing warning statements about pro-abortion-rights Catholic politicians and in barring them from communion.|$|E
5000|$|California: Incumbent U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer {{defeated}} California State Treasurer Matt Fong after {{a contentious}} race. Boxer, a staunch liberal {{who suffered from}} low approval ratings, was the most highly targeted Democratic incumbent senator in 1998. Republicans hoped that Fong would appeal to moderates, independents, and his fellow Asian-Americans. Fong pulled ahead of Boxer by early October, but a blitz of negative advertising by Boxer in the final weeks of the campaign that attacked Fong on <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and gun control helped boost the incumbent to a 53-43% win.|$|R

25|$|Campbell was the {{unsuccessful}} British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socred) {{candidate in}} Vancouver Centre {{for a seat}} in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983, receiving 12,740 votes (19.3% in a double member riding). Campbell ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the BC Social Credit Party in the summer of 1986 (placing last with 14 votes from delegates), but was elected in October 1986 to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as a Socred member for Vancouver-Point Grey, getting 19,716 votes (23.2%, also in a double member riding). Consigned to the backbenches, she became disenchanted with Premier Bill Vander Zalm's leadership and broke with him and Social Credit over <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> which Vander Zalm was opposed to. Campbell decided to leave provincial politics and enter federal politics.|$|E
25|$|After the Republicans {{took control}} of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> Traficant voted with the {{position}} of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the Republicans did not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century—outside the top leadership—to lack a single committee assignment.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association {{continued}} its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> {{back into the}} political arena in the 1960s. President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act. On the grounds of {{reducing the amount of}} disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped. The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service.|$|E

500|$|As {{a senator}} Hatfield took {{positions}} {{that made him}} hard to classify politically. In the Summer of 1969, he had told Murray Rothbard that he had [...] "committed himself {{to the cause of}} libertarianism." [...] Rothbard remarked concerning Hatfield, [...] "obviously his voting record is not particularly libertarian—it's very good on foreign policy and the draft, but it's not too great on other things", adding that [...] "in the abstract, at least, he is very favorable to libertarianism." [...] Hatfield was pro-life on <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and <b>the</b> death penalty, though as governor he chose not to commute the sentence of a convicted murderer and allowed that execution to go forward. As a prominent evangelical Christian, he opposed government-sponsored school prayer and supported civil rights for minorities.|$|R
25|$|The {{second season}} {{dealt with the}} practice's {{financial}} troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison {{that they are in}} danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was going nowhere. Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During {{the latter half of the}} season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn baby at the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale. Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a stir and tension among the doctors at Private Practice was <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> (a first for the practice), the sex reassignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year-old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, CFFC invited {{members of}} Congress to a {{briefing}} titled [...] "The Abortion Issue in the Political Process" [...] describing {{the problems facing}} Catholic politicians and {{to show that there}} was a range of personal and political responses to <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Geraldine Ferraro, then a member of the United States House of Representatives, wrote the introduction to the briefing. She wrote, [...] "As Catholics we deal each day, both personally and politically, with the wrenching abortion issue...the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Other endorsers of the briefing included fellow Democratic politicians Leon Panetta and Tom Daschle.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart, {{in which it}} invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional {{because it did not}} allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the Stenberg case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: [...] "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place {{in the history of this}} Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method of killing a human child... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion".|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper offers}} a {{critique}} <b>of</b> Block on <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> and child abandonment. Block regards aborting a fetus or abandoning a child as {{an instance of}} exercising one’s libertarian right of expelling trespassers from one’s private property. I argue that the above reasoning is flawed {{due to the lack}} of the appreciation of the fact that if one voluntarily initiates the causal chain which leads to someone else ending up on his property, the latter person cannot be considered a trespasser. Furthermore, in the light of the above observation, any direct effects resulting from that person’s eviction should be considered the responsibility of the property’s owner. All of this follows from the simple logical fact that in all links of the causal chain under consideration the owner is the ultimate causal agent...|$|R

5000|$|Every {{human being}} has the {{inherent}} right to life. This right shall {{be protected by}} law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. Article 6.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being. The concept of a right to life is central to debates on <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> capital punishment, euthanasia, self defence and war. According to many human rights activists, the death penalty violates this right.The United Nations has called on states retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment {{with a view to}} its abolition.
