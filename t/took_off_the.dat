His hair and scalp {{are said to}} have fallen out as he <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00.

At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E

Despite repeated warnings from a helicopter dispatched by the Coast Guard, the small plane continued on until it collided with an office building.

25|$|They withdrew {{overnight}} into Skull Creek, Georgia. The {{next day}} they sortied again. Under covering fires from Old Savannah engaging nearby heavy Union ships, the Sampson assisted in amphibious operations taking off numbers of the Port Royal garrison. Resolute, returning from delivering dispatches to the City of Savannah, evacuated the garrison at Fort Walker. She then landed at Pope’s Landing, Hilton Head Island, and spiked Confederate guns abandoned there. The Savannah landed a shore party of Marines to support Fort Beauregard under fire from Union warships, but the fort was lost before the reinforcements could arrive. The ship <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> garrison and returned to Savannah for repairs.|$|E
25|$|Hessilhead in its later {{days was}} {{occupied}} by the family of Lord Glasgow, and after they left, the proprietor, a Mr. Macmichael, about the year 1776, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roof and allowed {{the place to go}} to ruin. Circa 1887 - 92 it is described as being enclosed as a garden. Dobie records the despoiler of Hessilhead as a Mr. Carmichael, who sold the materials from the castle and also removed parts of the walls, as well as cutting down and selling an impressive old Yew tree. In the 1960s the remains of the castle were blown up on the instructions of Howie of Dunlop.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292 {{took off}} from Burbank, and the nose gear failed to retract and instead jammed sideways. The {{aircraft}} spent several hours in the air before safely making an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport, with 140 passengers and 6 crew members aboard. The Airbus A320 was originally bound for JFK International Airport, in New York City, New York. After the aircraft <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> incident was quickly captured by news helicopters which ran feed that was shown live nationally on cable news. Notably, many passengers on the flight said they watched images of their own aircraft's flight on JetBlue's LiveTV system.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the bra <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> way it did {{in large part because of}} World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in {{factories}} and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1810, Alban was off Læsø island {{when she}} saw six Danish gunboats coming towards her from the {{direction}} of the Skaw. Wind conditions were calm so Alban had to resort to her sweeps to try to escape the Danes. She was unsuccessful and by early afternoon an engagement had commenced. After about three hours, a cannon shot <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back of Thomas's skull. His second in command, Midshipman Alexander Hutchinson, continued the resistance for another hour, but then struck. Alban had lost two men killed (including Thomas), and had three wounded, out of a crew of some 25. She also had five feet of water in her hold, and her rigging and sails were entirely shot away. The subsequent court martial honourably acquitted Hutchinson and the surviving officers and men, and recommended Hutchinson for promotion. The Danish gunboat flotilla was under the command of Lieutenant Jørgen Conrad de Falsen.|$|E

25|$|On 25 July 200 P-40s {{were given}} to the Soviet Union by Winston Churchill in order to aid the country's air defences. As a naval strategist, the Far North appealed to Churchill for intervention. He sent the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) to conduct an attack on Finnish bases at Kirkenes and Petsamo. On 30 July the {{aircraft}} carrier Victorious and Furious were dispatched to deliver the strike forces. Nine Fairey Albacores of 817 Squadron, nine Fairey Swordfish from 812 Squadron, escorted by six Fairey Fulmars of 801 Squadron <b>took</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> harbour at Kirkenes was empty, and one Albacore and two Fulmars were lost to AAA fire. The operation from Victorious was a disaster. 20 Albacores from 827 and 828 Squadrons, and nine Fulmars from 809 Squadrons were intercepted by four Bf 110s and nine Bf 109s from 1.(Z)./JG 77, 1./JG 77 and 14./JG 77. Only one aircraft escaped battle damage. The Germans claimed 17 destroyed for one loss (Bf 110). The FAA losses indicated 13 lost (11 Albacores and two Fulmars) and nine Albacores damaged. 827 Squadron lost six Albacore, five airmen killed and 14 captured. 828 Squadron lost five of eight Albacores, seven killed and eight captured.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} Creole {{attacked}} Esther. Creole, of Barracoa, was armed with {{six or seven}} guns of various calibers and had a crew of 111 men {{under the command of}} Captain Pierre Burgman. The two vessels exchanged fire for about an hour and then the privateers, taking advantage of the lack of wind, used their sweeps to come alongside. The fight continued for another 45 minutes, before the privateers could board. The fight then continued for another 20 minutes. Esthers officers and crew resisted until Irving was wounded and retired to his cabin, telling his third mate to strike. The privateers killed Irving in his cabin and proceeded to massacre a number of the other crewmen. A pilot boat from Charleston came out and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> survivors. Two died on the boat, Mr. Ashton,the first mate, died on the wharf, and two more men died in the hospital. Two seamen at the hospital and 13 others were so terribly cut up that most were not expected to survive. Three of Esthers crew, a Venetian and two Portuguese, joined the privateer, though they had fought well during the action. Creole lost six killed, seven wounded, and had several men missing, believed to have been knocked overboard and drowned.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
