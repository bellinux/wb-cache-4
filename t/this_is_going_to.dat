Smith, {{who plays}} the {{formidable}} and disdainful Dowager Countess, has a lovely way of delivering words, always spaced to perfection. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a treat if you like a lavish period drama of a Sunday evening.|$|E
25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't know if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and {{thank you so much}} to them.|$|E

500|$|Laws {{should be}} [...] "prospective, open and clear". The {{meaning of the}} law should not be [...] "ambiguous, vague, obscure or imprecise", and the law must be {{sufficiently}} publicized.

500|$|During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts {{noted that}} the case was a [...] "very {{familiar}} situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," [...] {{and that the only}} way that one could draw a line between the two [...] "is to have somebody say: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the line."

I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed.

[...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct.
