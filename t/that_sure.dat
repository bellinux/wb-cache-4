500|$|Thousands of Nazis, {{including}} former SS members such as Trawniki guard Jakob Reimer and Circassian collaborator Tscherim Soobzokov, {{fled to the}} United States {{under the guise of}} refugees, sometimes using forged documents. Other SS men, such as Soobzokov, SD officer Wilhelm Höttl, Eichmann aide Otto von Bolschwing, and accused war criminal Theodor Saevecke, were employed by American intelligence agencies against the Soviets. As CIA officer Harry Rositzke noted, [...] "It was a visceral business of using any bastard so long as he was anti-Communist... The eagerness or desire to enlist collaborators means <b>that</b> <b>sure,</b> you didn't look at their credentials too closely." [...] Similarly, the Soviets used SS personnel after the war; Operation Theo, for instance, disseminated [...] "subversive rumours" [...] in Allied-occupied Germany.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{called the}} final game, [...]hack//Quarantine, a {{satisfying}} conclusion to a mediocre series, while others {{said it is}} a confusing mess of poor pacing and plot holes. Dunham awarded the game 8.3 out of 10 and called the plot twists [...] "shocking and clever". Kasavin rated it 6.1 out of 10 and wrote that, [...] "n its own merits, Quarantine isn't a bad game, and [...] should find it to have a satisfying conclusion <b>that,</b> <b>sure</b> enough, leaves the possibility for further adventures in The World". He also called Bandai's decision to add 60 to 80 hours of padding to the game, split it into four full-priced products, and release these as a series disappointing. Nutt was similarly disappointed with the final game, awarding it two stars out of five. He wrote that the story was well-presented and excellent, {{but that it was}} only present in the game's first and last quarters. He was satisfied by the game's ending and loved its story, style, and characters, but grew tired of the game's [...] "endless chains of chambers, these easily-defeated enemies, this total lack of strategy". The Game Informer reviewer hoped to see a more effective implementation of [...]hacks concept in the future. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly gave the [...]hack games scores in the 29 to 30 out of 40 range, indicating average reviews. However, the Japanese Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) honored the series for its combination of different fictional media including games, anime, radio, and manga into a compelling whole at the 2002-2003 CESA Awards.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many critics, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade, and wrote that what he [...] "liked most of all" [...] was it being [...] "remarkably clear-eyed about {{who these people are}} and what they're capable of". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale <b>that</b> <b>sure</b> felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, you would have thought you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E
500|$|Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst {{found that}} [...] "man cannot live by {{composition}} alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 {{he was appointed}} first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the [...] "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm. Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for [...] "the Worm" [...] or any other light orchestra [...] "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted {{that some of the}} music was [...] "trashy" [...] but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: [...] "To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and <b>that</b> <b>sure</b> touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely {{to the fact that he}} has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience." ...|$|E
