5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.

However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. <b>The</b> <b>reform</b> was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> never came to fruition. <b>The</b> <b>reform</b> is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E

Although <b>the</b> <b>Reform</b> Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new Prime Minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of <b>the</b> <b>Reform</b> Party to begin 28 years of uninterrupted stewardship.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>reform,</b> in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia.

In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, <b>the</b> <b>reform</b> was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the neoliberal health sector reforms {{that have taken}} place in Latin America, the preparation of health care workers for <b>the</b> <b>reforms,</b> <b>the</b> reforms' impacts on the workers, and the consequences that <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> have had on efficiency and quality in the health sector. The piece also looks at the process of formulating and implementing <b>the</b> <b>reforms.</b> <b>The</b> piece utilizes secondary sources and in-depth interviews with health sector managers in Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Mexico. Neoliberal reforms have not solved the human resources problems that health sector evaluations and academic studies had identified as the leading causes of health system inefficiency and low-quality services that existed before <b>the</b> <b>reforms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reforms</b> worsened <b>the</b> situation by putting new pressures on health personnel, in terms of both the lack of necessary training to face the challenges that came with <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> and efforts to take away from workers the rights and benefits that they had gained during years of struggles by unions, and to replace them with temporary contracts, reduced job security, and lower benefits. The secrecy with which <b>the</b> <b>reforms</b> were developed and applied made workers even more unified. In response, unions opposed <b>the</b> <b>reforms,</b> and in some countries they were able to delay <b>the</b> <b>reforms.</b> <b>The</b> neoliberal <b>reforms</b> have not improved the efficiency or quality of health systems in Latin America despite the resources that have been invested. Nor have <b>the</b> neoliberal <b>reforms</b> supported specific changes that have been applied in the public sector and that have demonstrated their ability to solve important health problems.
