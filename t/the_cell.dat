5|$|At {{a certain}} point during <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle in open mitosis, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the local}} protein {{synthesis}} hypothesis gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E
5|$|By {{means of}} the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; sodium {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{microspore}} divides by mitosis producing two <b>cells.</b> <b>The</b> {{first of}} <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> (<b>the</b> generative <b>cell)</b> {{is small and}} is formed inside <b>the</b> second larger <b>cell</b> (<b>the</b> tube <b>cell).</b>|$|R
50|$|The anterior/posterior axis is {{specified}} by the sperm at the posterior side. At <b>the</b> two <b>cell</b> stage, <b>the</b> anterior <b>cell</b> is <b>the</b> AB <b>cell</b> while <b>the</b> posterior <b>cell</b> is <b>the</b> P1 <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> dorsal/ventral axis of the animal is set by a random position of <b>cells</b> during <b>the</b> four <b>cell</b> stage of <b>the</b> embryo. <b>The</b> dorsal <b>cell</b> is <b>the</b> ABp <b>cell</b> while <b>the</b> ventral <b>cell</b> is <b>the</b> EMS <b>cell.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> two <b>cell</b> stage, <b>the</b> embryo of the {{nematode}} C. elegans exhibits mosaic behavior. There are two <b>cells,</b> <b>the</b> P1 <b>cell</b> and <b>the</b> AB <b>cell.</b> <b>The</b> P1 <b>cell</b> {{was able}} {{make all of}} its fated <b>cells</b> while <b>the</b> AB <b>cell</b> could only make a portion of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> it was fated to produce. Thus, The first division gives the autonomous specification of <b>the</b> two <b>cells,</b> but <b>the</b> AB <b>cells</b> require a conditional mechanism to produce all of its fated cells.|$|R
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> sometimes by direct fusion with <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|If a cell has state 0, its {{new state}} {{is taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to its left. Otherwise, its new state is taken from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> to its right. That is, each cell can be {{implemented}} by a multiplexer, and is closely related in its operation to a Fredkin gate.|$|E
5|$|In euryarchaea <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> {{division}} protein FtsZ, {{which forms}} a contracting ring around <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> and {{the components of}} the septum that is constructed across the center of <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> division machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E
5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at even time steps and <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in even positions at odd time steps and <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> in odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets {{can be viewed as}} a cellular automaton with only its half of <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R

Like <b>the</b> others, <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> {{are covered with}} cradle vaults from inside and with grooved bricks outside. There are two extra niche on <b>the</b> corner <b>cell</b> and one extra on the third and fifth cells from south. At <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> on <b>the</b> qibla wing, there are two windows that face the {{courtyard}} and the street.|$|R
50|$|Cell {{reversal}} {{can occur}} to a weakly charged cell {{even before it}} is fully discharged.If the battery drain current is high enough, <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> internal resistance can create a resistive voltage drop that is greater than <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> forward emf.This results in the reversal of <b>the</b> <b>cell's</b> polarity while <b>the</b> current is flowing. The higher the required discharge rate of a battery, the better matched <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> should be, both in <b>the</b> type of <b>cell</b> and state of charge, {{in order to reduce}} <b>the</b> chances of <b>cell</b> reversal.|$|R
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> sap. Pigments that color <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> are sometime located in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Many receptors have a binding site exposed on <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> surface and an effector domain within <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{cellular}} uptake {{was further}} observed using flow cytometer. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> were seeded in 12 -well plates and incubated overnight. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> were then exposed with rhodamine B-loaded NP and incubated for 1  h and 2  h, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> were then extracted and washed twice with PBS. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> were resuspended in PBS buffer and analyzed using a Calibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter equipped with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).|$|R
50|$|The {{dominating}} {{content of}} body fluids is body water. In humans approximately 60-65% of body water is contained within <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> (in intracellular fluid) {{with the other}} 35-40% of body water contained outside <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> (in extracellular fluid). This fluid component outside <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> includes <b>the</b> fluid between <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> (interstitial fluid), lymph and blood. There are approximately 6 to 10 liters of lymph in the body, compared to 3.5 to 5 liters of blood.|$|R

5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E

30|$|After 21  days of {{cultivation}} the strontium concentration inside <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> {{might be}} lower as in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> which were only cultured {{for one day}} due to the proliferation. In Figure  5 F the strontium content in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on a silicon wafer for 21  days is almost as high as in <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> cultivated on A 10 (5 D). This leads to the assumption that strontium is accumulated in <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> However, to compare the strontium content in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on <b>the</b> different biomaterials and substrates the hMSCs from the same donor were used. Again three cells on each type of substrate were measured. The strontium peak areas of the mass spectra of the different samples are compared in Figure  7 A. The highest strontium content was found in <b>the</b> osteoblast-like <b>cells</b> cultured on <b>the</b> strontium enriched cements (S 100 r and A 10 r), and the lowest was found in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> cultured for 21  days on a silicon-wafer (Si 21 d). A high variation in the strontium content of <b>the</b> A 10 <b>cells</b> could be observed. As only three <b>cells</b> were measured <b>the</b> inhomogeneity of the A 10 cement sample could cause such variation. In the case of <b>the</b> biomaterials <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> were relocated after 21  days on silicon wafers. Only perfectly adherent cells were chosen for depth profiling but as <b>the</b> relocated <b>cells</b> were no longer exposed to additional strontium, and the relocation causes stress for <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>the</b> real strontium content could be different afterwards. To investigate the influence of <b>the</b> relocation, osteoblast-like <b>cells</b> were cultured with 1.0  mM SrCl 2 for 21  days and one load was relocated afterwards by trypsination and subsequent re-seeding on a silicon wafer (SrCl 2 1.0 r). To clarify whether {{the intensity of the}} strontium signal as obtained with ToF-SIMS {{can be used as a}} measure of <b>the</b> strontium concentration; <b>cells</b> were cultured on silicon wafers with two different SrCl 2 concentrations. The strontium content inside <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> of these control groups can be seen in Figure  7 B. There is a large difference between the strontium intensity of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> cultured with 0.1  mM and 1.0  mM SrCl 2. This diagram indicates that it is possible to detect the comparative difference of strontium contents inside <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> which were exposed to different strontium concentrations via ToF-SIMS. Furthermore it proves that the strontium content in cells will be higher if <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> are exposed to a higher concentration of strontium. The strontium content in <b>the</b> relocated <b>cells</b> (SrCl 2 1.0 r) is much lower than in the original sample (SrCl 2 1.0). The relocation of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> influences <b>the</b> strontium signal. That means that the original strontium content of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on <b>the</b> cements could be much higher than it is observed in Figure  7 A.|$|R

5|$|The {{concentrations}} of free calcium in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> can regulate {{an array of}} reactions and is important for signal transduction in <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Mitochondria can transiently store calcium, a contributing process for the cell's homeostasis of calcium.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. <b>The</b> <b>cell</b> membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> averting needed materials from leaving <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> make <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E
