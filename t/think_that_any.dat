5|$|Pitching {{exclusively}} in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm {{finished in the}} top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7–8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.|$|E

25|$|Mayer {{eventually}} retired, {{and the new}} detective {{assigned to}} the case told Nels Rasmussen that {{he was unable to}} follow up on Mayer's notes and did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> new leads would emerge. Nels was rebuffed again in 1993, when he offered to pay for DNA testing on the evidence from the murder, now that the technology was available; he was told that the police had to have a suspect in order to proceed with testing. Lazarus briefly reunited with Ruetten in 1989; Mayer's notes show that Ruetten had called him and asked whether he still considered her a suspect.|$|E

25|$|Oliphant {{took the}} Frisch–Peierls {{memorandum}} to Tizard in March 1940. He {{passed it on}} Thomson, who discussed it with Cockroft and Oliphant. They also heard from Jacques Allier of the French Deuxieme Bureau, who {{had been involved in}} the removal of the entire stock of heavy water from Norway. He told them of the interest the Germans had shown in the heavy water, and in the activity of the French researchers in Paris. Immediate action was taken: the Ministry of Economic Warfare was asked to secure stocks of uranium oxide in danger of being captured by the Germans; British intelligence agencies were asked to investigate the activities of German nuclear scientists; and A. V. Hill, the British Scientific Attaché in Washington, was asked {{to find out what the}} Americans were up to. Hill reported that the Americans had scientists investigating the matter, but they did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> military applications were in prospect.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs on}} Diorama were {{inspired}} by Johns' then-girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia, but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating [...] "Everyone will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> lyric that's about someone {{in a positive light}} will be about her" [...] and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.|$|E
500|$|Wainwright never {{intended}} to impersonate Garland or create a drag act, but rather to inhabit the songs and expose them to a new generation. However, {{there was a certain}} camp style present, of which Wainwright stated the following: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> gay person in the world would be seduced at one point by a certain kind of camp. For certain people it's kind of a saving grace." [...] Regarding the tribute concerts and homosexuality, Wainwright admitted: ...|$|E

The advantages of a self-contained room are that male-oriented design choices, such as [...] "tacky lamps" [...] and [...] "beer-can sculptures", are out of sight of women, but in a way that doesn't disturb female sensibilities since visitors generally don't visit the man cave. It's like a firehouse lounge room, but in the home.|$|R
500|$|In London, Grainger's charm, {{good looks}} and talent (with some {{assistance}} from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's playing [...] "revealed rare intelligence {{and a good deal}} of artistic insight". [...] In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended [...] his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a [...] "love-serve job". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced [...] "an overpowering landslide" [...] of feeling, and that [...] "I thought I was about to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> joy entered into it".|$|E
500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{features}} several recurring themes, including death, resurrection, {{and growing}} old. Upon writing his script, Meyer hit upon {{a link between}} Spock's death {{and the age of}} the characters. [...] "This {{was going to be a}} story in which Spock died, so it was going to be a story about death, and it was only a short hop, skip, and a jump to realize that it was going to be about old age and friendship," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> of [...] scripts were about old age, friendship, and death." [...] In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock's sacrifice and the Genesis Device, Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country, in reference to Prince Hamlet's description of death in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge. Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan, but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi (renamed Return of the Jedi late in production).|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, in {{the same}} addendum, a {{critical}} analysis of their work made by post-doc Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as [...] "very accurate", was included {{with the exception of}} the concluding remark [...] "Just to make sure: I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> of the above is valid reasoning", thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support. [...] Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, [...] "It's certainly possible that you have some new worthwhile results on quantum groups", was translated as [...] "Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques" [...] ("It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups") and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{these claims}} are widely disputed by the {{financial}} industry, who typically regard hedge funds as [...] "small enough to fail", since most are relatively small {{in terms of the}} assets they manage and operate with low leverage, thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail. [...] Formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the 2008 financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and counter-cyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector. Hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis, even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase. Hedge funds fail regularly, and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis. In testimony to the House Financial Services Committee in 2009, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board Chairman said he [...] "would not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually".|$|E

25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|R

2500|$|The Secretary of State {{responded by}} {{directing}} Lord Wavell to send 'actual proposals for defining genuine Muslim areas'. The task fell on V. P. Menon, the Reforms Commissioner, {{and his colleague}} Sir B. N. Rau in the Reforms Office. They prepared a note called [...] "Demarcation of Pakistan Areas", where they defined the western zone of Pakistan as consisting of Sindh, N.W.F.P., British Baluchistan and three western divisions of Punjab (Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore). However, they noted that this allocation would leave 2.2 million Sikhs in the Pakistan area and about 1.5 million in India. Excluding the Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts of the Lahore Division from Pakistan would put a majority of Sikhs in India. (Amritsar had a non-Muslim majority and Gurdaspur a marginal Muslim majority.) To compensate for {{the exclusion of the}} Gurdaspur district, they included the entire Dinajpur district in the eastern zone of Pakistan, which similarly had a marginal Muslim majority. After receiving comments from John Thorne, member of the Executive Council in charge of Home affairs, Wavell forwarded the proposal to the Secretary of State. He justified the exclusion of the Amritsar district because of its sacredness to the Sikhs and that of Gurdaspur district because it had to go with Amritsar for 'geographical reasons'. The Secretary of State commended the proposal and forwarded it to the India and Burma Committee, saying, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>any</b> better division than the one the Viceroy proposes is likely to be found".|$|E
