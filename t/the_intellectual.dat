5|$|After the war, {{under the}} Polish People's Republic, <b>the</b> <b>intellectual</b> and {{academic}} community of Kraków was put under complete political control. The universities were soon deprived of printing rights and autonomy. The Stalinist government ordered {{the construction of}} the country's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta. The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks (now Sendzimir Steelworks owned by Mittal) sealed Kraków's transformation from a university city, into an industrial centre. The new working-class, drawn by the industrialisation of Kraków, contributed to rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into <b>the</b> <b>intellectual</b> sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E

His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E

50|$|From the {{orthodox}} point of view, Zachary Abuza (2001) considered that <b>the</b> <b>intellectuals</b> in Nhan Van Giai Pham were {{a group of}} dissidents who were joined the Viet Minh out of patriotism, not a love of communism.
