About 260,000 <b>tweets</b> were sent while the final episode aired, with a peak of 8,942 <b>tweets</b> per minute.|$|R
30|$|Quality of <b>tweets</b> {{was also}} very low. Even after {{filtering}} there were quite a few <b>tweets</b> {{which resulted in a}} zero score from SentiWord, meaning that those <b>tweets</b> in no way express any sentiment towards the iPhone 6. Lower number of such <b>tweets</b> and larger number of expressive <b>tweets</b> would also yield more elaborate and diverse results.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, Cattermole later re-ignited reunion rumours {{following}} a <b>tweet</b> {{to his former}} group mates. Barrett performed with O'Meara, McIntosh and Cattermole at Birmingham Pride 2014 and other gigs after that; meaning that the group was known as 'S Club 4'.|$|E

30|$|Originally {{through the}} twitter API we {{collected}} 940 <b>tweets.</b> But once NLP filtering was applied 442 <b>tweets</b> were left. The {{rest of the}} <b>tweets</b> were not useful in any way for sentiment analysis. Generally simple queries would normally return a lot of <b>tweets.</b> With a query which only contains the term iPhone 6 {{it is possible to}} get 1500 <b>tweets</b> or more in one run. But as more parameters are added to the query number of <b>tweets</b> returned is reduced. As we used location parameter and two search parameters, one for iPhone and the other for a feature, the number of <b>tweets</b> that we obtained was lower.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{orthodontic}} patient experience with braces compared to Invisalign® by means of a large-scale Twitter sentiment analysis. A custom data collection program was created to collect <b>tweets</b> containing the words “braces” or “Invisalign. ” A hierarchal Naïve Bayes sentiment classifier was developed to sort the <b>tweets</b> into one of five categories: positive, negative, neutral, advertisement, or not applicable. Among the 419, 363 <b>tweets</b> applicable to orthodontics collected, users posted significantly more positive <b>tweets</b> (61 %) than negative <b>tweets</b> (39 %) (p-value = ® <b>tweets</b> (p-value= 0. 4189). In conclusion, Twitter users express more positive than negative sentiment about orthodontic treatment with no significant difference in sentiment between braces and Invisalign® <b>tweets...</b>|$|R
30|$|As for the {{temporal}} set of <b>tweets,</b> we gathered the followers’ <b>tweets</b> who were retweeted the <b>tweets</b> {{from the three}} retailer accounts. As {{the same as the}} setting in Sect.  4.2, the <b>tweets</b> from the followers were picked up from the former period of the retweeting actions. The period for observing the followers’ behavior was from February 1 to 16, 2016. The numbers of gathered followers’ <b>tweets</b> in this period are shown in Table 11.|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{information}} seeking behaviors in microblogosphere, the microblog track at TREC 2011 intro-duced a real-time ad-hoc retrieval task that aims at ranking relevant <b>tweets</b> in reverse-chronological order. We study this problem via a two-phase approach: 1) retrieving <b>tweets</b> in an ad-hoc way; 2) utilizing the temporal information of <b>tweets</b> {{to enhance the}} retrieval effectiveness of <b>tweets.</b> <b>Tweets</b> can be categorized into two types. One type consists of short messages not containing any URL of a Web page. The other type {{has at least one}} URL of a Web page in addition to a short message. These two types of <b>tweets</b> have dif-ferent structures. In the first phase, to address the structural difference of <b>tweets,</b> we propose a method to rank <b>tweets</b> using the divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first rank the two types of <b>tweets</b> sep-arately. This produces two rankings, one for each type. Then we merge these two rankings of <b>tweets</b> into one ranking. In the second phase, we first categorize queries into several types by exploring the temporal distributions of their top-retrieved <b>tweets</b> from the first phase; then we calculate the time-related relevance scores of <b>tweets</b> according to the classified types of queries; finally we combine the time scores with the IR scores from the first phase to produce a ranking of <b>tweets.</b> Experimental results achieved by using the TREC 2011 and TREC 2012 queries over the TREC <b>Tweets</b> 2011 collection show that: (i) our way of ranking the two types of <b>tweets</b> separately and then merging them together yields better retrieval effectiveness than rank-ing them simultaneously; (ii) our way of incorporating temporal information into the retrieval process yields further improvements, and (iii) our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods in retrieval effectiveness...|$|R
5|$|The boycotts {{were largely}} led or {{supported}} by celebrities. Film star Chen Kun posted {{a message to}} Weibo—where he had 70 million followers—stating {{that he would be}} boycotting Malaysia until its government told the truth.

5|$|A Twitterbot is a {{computer}} program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to <b>tweet,</b> retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often {{used to build large}} follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase. Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.|$|E

30|$|Named entity {{recognition}} (NER) {{is a task}} {{of detecting}} named entities in documents and categorizing them to predefined classes, such as person, location, and organization. This paper focuses on <b>tweets</b> posted on Twitter. Since <b>tweets</b> are noisy, irregular, brief, and include acronyms and spelling errors, NER in those <b>tweets</b> is a challenging task. Many approaches have been proposed {{to deal with this}} problem in <b>tweets</b> written in English, Germany, Chinese, etc., but none for Vietnamese <b>tweets.</b>|$|R

A documentary following O'Brien during the tour, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, was released in June 2011.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{summarizing}} the collection of <b>tweets</b> related to a business. Our procedure aggregates <b>tweets</b> into subtopic clusters which are then ranked and summarized by a few representative <b>tweets</b> from each cluster. Central to our approach {{is the ability to}} group diverse <b>tweets</b> into clusters. The broad clustering is induced by first learning a small set of business-related concepts automatically from free text and then subdividing the <b>tweets</b> into these concepts. Cluster ranking is performed using an importance score which combines topic coherence and sentiment value of the <b>tweets.</b> We also discuss alternative methods to summarize these <b>tweets</b> and evaluate the approaches using a small user study. Results show that the concept-based summaries are ranked favourably by the users...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThese days {{social media}} {{services}} are widespread and are infrastructure of {{communication in the}} Internet. Since Twitter {{is one of the}} most famous real-time communication services, we can grasp opinions of crowds in the real world analyzing <b>tweets.</b> There are usually various kind of opinions in Twitter and you need to deal with the opinions carefully. In this paper we focus on <b>tweets</b> on an incident and extract <b>tweets</b> reflecting sufferers’ opinions. When a incident happens, vast amount of <b>tweets</b> are created by many Twitter users. We compare <b>tweets</b> by sufferers with ones by others and extract <b>tweets</b> unique to the sufferers with density ratio estimation. In experiments we confirm that our proposed method can extract <b>tweets</b> including sufferers’ opinions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a preliminary approach towards characterizing political fake news on Twitter through {{the analysis of}} their meta-data. In particular, we focus on more than 1. 5 M <b>tweets</b> collected {{on the day of}} the election of Donald Trump as 45 th president of the United States of America. We use the meta-data embedded within those <b>tweets</b> in order to look for differences between <b>tweets</b> containing fake news and <b>tweets</b> not containing them. Specifically, we perform our analysis only on <b>tweets</b> that went viral, by studying proxies for users' exposure to the <b>tweets,</b> by characterizing accounts spreading fake news, and by looking at their polarization. We found significant differences on the distribution of followers, the number of URLs on <b>tweets,</b> and the verification of the users...|$|R
