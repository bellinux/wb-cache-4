A veteran of the Second World War from Florida, Kimmel {{suffered}} from posttraumatic stress disorder, often causing him severe mood swings. He developed an interest in occultism and became intensely jealous of Parsons' continuing influence over Cameron, destroying Parsons' notes on the Babalon Working that she had kept.

She allowed her daughter to behave how she pleased, believing that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way for to learn. With her friend, the film-maker Curtis Harrington, Cameron then produced a short film, The Wormwood Star, which was filmed at the home of multi-millionaire art collector Edward James; the film features images of Cameron's paintings, and recitations of her poems.|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is Beck's {{innovative}} guitar playing. Shadwick comments it [...] "suited Beck's taste for shaping and sculpting guitar sounds through the control and manipulation of sustain and, on occasion, feedback". Beck recalled he began incorporating feedback into his guitar solos after he realised that he could control it, adding [...] "I started finding the resonant points on the neck where it came in best. [...] I loved {{it because it was}} a most peculiar sound that contrasted wildly with a plucked string, this round trombone-like noise coming from nowhere. [...] In addition to feedback, Beck's uses a musical scale and bent notes variously described as Eastern, Indian, or raga sounding. [...] Critics and biographers have called the solo [...] "monumental fuzz-drenched", [...] "explosively warped", and [...] "climaxed with a solitary, gigantic burst of feedback". [...] For many, the song represents the Yardbirds' creative peak, including Beck. [...] He commented, [...] "'Shapes of Things' was the pinnacle of the Yardbirds" [...] and added [...] "if I did nothing else, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> single".|$|E

[...] Later reviewers compared it directly to The Parallax View (1974) and All The President's Men (1976). [...] Ridley Scott initially expressed an interest in directing the film, and the studio agreed to finance the project, only for Scott to drop out. A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of [...] "those '70s paranoia pictures" [...] and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the [...] toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios.|$|E
500|$|Wright scored his 27th {{goal of the}} season, away at Chelsea in {{the first}} week of April; it took him seven goals short of {{breaking}} Cliff Bastin's career record at Arsenal. A win against Leicester City was Arsenal's fifth league win in six matches and boosted the club's chances of finishing second, which came with a spot in the Champions League. Wenger assessed that it was [...] "not impossible to win the title", adding [...] "but when you see Manchester United winning again, realistically you would like to be in their position." [...] A last-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers against Arsenal on 19 April 1997 was controversial given the manner the opposition had scored; with Hughes cramped, Vieira kicked the ball out in order for his teammate to be treated. It was anticipated [...] "by the game's conventions", Blackburn should have thrown the ball back unchallenged, but striker Chris Sutton forced a corner. The result prompted Wenger to rule out any chance of winning the league: [...] "The best team [...] has won. But the race for second place is still open and for many weeks I have thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> we could achieve." [...] A further draw against Coventry City, who were fighting to stay another season in the top-flight, moved Arsenal to within four points of Manchester United. They had however played two games more than the incumbent champions and one more than Liverpool sitting in third. Robbie Elliott scored the winner for Newcastle United against Arsenal on 3 May 1997, which reignited their chances of finishing second. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Derby County, who staged their final match at the Baseball Ground. In spite of winning by three goals to one, having played with ten men for the majority of the game, they missed out on second by goal difference to Newcastle.|$|E

Later that year, Rosenberg was shopping the show around to other networks, saying [...] "I don’t know if it’s an ABC show. It might be a cable show, really. The [...] graphic novel {{is the first one}} that Marvel did that was meant to serve an adult audience. I toned it down a little bit for network, but it’s very, very easy to translate that into cable. Very easy." [...] In October 2013, Deadline reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Rosenberg was brought on to write and produce the new incarnation of the series, to be reconfigured from her original project, which she called a [...] "page one do-over" [...] from her original vision.

2500|$|On April 16, 1961 {{there were}} {{initially}} 11 targets that {{were scheduled to}} be attacked. The list later got narrowed down to 4. These 4 included the San Antonio Air Base, the Campo Liberated Air Base, and finally the naval bases located at Batabano and Nueca Gerona. Additionally, the number of B-26 crafts {{to be used in}} the strike was cut down from 15 to 5, which ultimately limited the US's air coverage. The CIA's Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation notes that this left the Brigade air force open to attacks by Castro's forces. The document states that, [...] "There is no doubt that if there had been more JMATE aircraft and more aircrews, constant air cover would have been possible." [...] Both Kennedys ignored the fact that limited air strikes would prevent the Brigade air force from being effective because of the risk of counter attack by the Cuban air force. A White House staffer was quoted as saying, [...] "...the plan was to destroy Castro's air force on the ground before the battle began, and then provide air support, with an anti-Castro [...] "Air Force" [...] consisting of some two dozen surplus planes flown by Cuban exiles. That plan failed." [...] On the 18th of April there was an air transport scheduled from the USAF and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> day for the Brigade B-26’s mobilization to occur. During this strike there were no aircraft lost and there was a successful strike made on the Castro column moving from Playa Larga to Playa Giron. The Official History of this operation notes that there were several uncertainties as to the outcomes of various operations between April 17–19, 1961, including the number and identities of casualties of both pilots and Cuban civilians, as well as a question over the possible use of napalm by Acting Chief of the US Air section Garfield Thorsrud's aircraft on April 17, 1961. The Official History notes that the use of napalm had not been officially approved until the next day, April 18, 1961. 10 days later TIDE dropped 5 B-26 bombs.|$|E
