5|$|The Viking {{invasions of}} the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North-East England, leading {{in turn to}} another wave of conversion. Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs were very similar to other Germanic groups, with a pantheon of gods {{including}} Odin, Thor and Ullr, combined with a belief in a final, apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok. The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly, assimilating their beliefs into Christianity in the decades following the occupation of York, which the Archbishop had survived. The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England's leading Churchmen to negotiate with <b>the</b> <b>warlords.</b> As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert, many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England {{to assist in the}} process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1926, Hu Lanqi left home for Guangzhou to work for He Xiangning, Minister of Women's Affairs of the Kuomintang (KMT) government. The {{following}} year, she became a cadet of the Whampoa Military Academy in Wuhan and enlisted in the KMT's National Revolutionary Army, which was then waging the Northern Expedition against <b>the</b> <b>warlords.</b> She {{was one of a}} small number of women recruits, which included Xie Bingying and Zhao Yiman. After initial success, the KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek turned against the Communists, who had been until then allied with the KMT, and committed the Shanghai massacre in April 1927. The Wuhan-based left wing of the KMT, who were sympathetic to the Communists, capitulated to Chiang's right wing. Hu Lanqi was discharged from the army when the military academy was dissolved in July 1927. Instead of returning home, she continued to work for the left-wing KMT leader He Xiangning, helping her unionize female workers. She broke up with her second husband whose political views differed from hers.|$|E
25|$|In 211, Zhang He {{participated in}} the Battle of Weinan against a {{coalition}} of warlords from the Guanzhong region led by Ma Chao and Han Sui. The coalition broke up after Cao Cao defeated <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> in the battle. Cao Cao sent Zhang He to lead a force to attack one of <b>the</b> <b>warlords,</b> Yang Qiu, at Anding Commandery (安定郡; covering parts of present-day Ningxia and Gansu), and Zhang succeeded in forcing Yang to surrender. In 212, Zhang He accompanied Xiahou Yuan on a campaign against another of <b>the</b> <b>warlords,</b> Liang Xing (梁興), and the Di tribes in Wudu Commandery (武都郡; in present-day Longnan, Gansu). In 214, Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He defeated Ma Chao, who had borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery after being driven out of Guanzhong. They also eliminated rebel forces led by Song Jian (宋建).|$|E

25|$|From 196 onwards, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} obvious that an armed confrontation between <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> Cao Cao and Yuan Shao was inevitable. Yuan Shao {{was in control}} of the lands north of the Yellow River, namely the Hebei region, and had large and powerful armies under his command. Cao Cao controlled most of the lands south of the Yellow River and had the Emperor Xian with him in the new capital city of Xu. <b>The</b> <b>warlords</b> saw each other as the barrier to their individual ambitions to conquer and rule China. Thus, it seemed that a trial of strength between the two warlords was inevitable.|$|E
50|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, <b>The</b> <b>Warlord</b> is <b>the</b> pirate of a fleet {{when he was}} attacked by pirate Deathstroke in battle stealing their loot. During <b>the</b> battle, <b>The</b> <b>Warlord's</b> crew was killed while he escaped using the hovercraft. Later, <b>The</b> <b>Warlord</b> plans to attack Deathstroke and retrieve Jenny Blitz {{who has been in}} stasis since she was stolen from him. <b>The</b> <b>Warlord</b> ambushed Deathstroke and his fleet and demanded that they surrender. But in answer Deathstroke shot <b>The</b> <b>Warlord's</b> right eye using a scoped sniper rifle. He had been aiming for his mouth. Deathstroke fired at <b>The</b> <b>Warlord's</b> ship again, and it unexpectedly blew up. Each ship in Warlord's fleet subsequently exploded.

Jenny appears to be able to project explosive force from her hands.|$|R

25|$|Stationary bandits can amass {{power because}} of their {{economic}} connections with foreign firms. Oftentimes warlords will exert violence on a particular region {{in order to gain}} control. Once in control, these warlords can expropriate the property or resources from the people and land and redistribute the riches in exchange for monetary value. When people live in a particular region dominated by a warlord, they can choose to flee or live within the political structure <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> have created. If <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> provide protection against external threats of violence, the people will be likely to stay and continue living and working in that region, even though they are being extorted. The trade-off becomes protection for extraction, and this political framework is common in periphery regions of countries which do not have a strong central government.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{with the}} Transitional Government collapsed. Ethiopia {{deployed}} hundreds {{of troops in}} Baidoa, and those numbers would continue to increase into thousands. The capture of Kismayo soured relations with both Somaliland and Puntland, as Jubaland was recognized as a political entity in many Somali circles, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> who were universally viewed as being illegitimate.|$|E

25|$|These {{groups were}} {{fundamental}} to the mission, and themselves depended on both the ecclesiastical hierarchy as well as <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> who controlled the lands where they lived.

25|$|In 198, {{during the}} Battle of Xiapi, fought between <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> Lü Bu and Cao Cao (with support from Liu Bei), Cao's forces besieged Lü Bu in Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu) and {{directed}} {{the waters of the}} Yi (沂) and Si rivers to flood the city.

25|$|The Battle of Guandu {{was fought}} between <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> Cao Cao and Yuan Shao in 200 AD {{in the late}} Eastern Han dynasty.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Afghanistan, the state-warlord {{bargaining}} sometimes extends beyond these informal accords and elevates {{to the status of}} political clientelism, in which <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> are appointed to formal government positions, such as regional governor, a title which provides them political legitimacy. It has been shown that during the state-warlord bargaining phase, warlords in Afghanistan have a high motivation to prolong war to create political instability, expose weakness of the central state, prompt regional criticism against the government and continue economic extraction.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Dushi Ford was {{a battle}} fought between <b>the</b> <b>warlords</b> Cao Cao and Yuan Shao {{in the first}} lunar month of 200 in the late Eastern Han dynasty. In the battle, Yuan Shao {{launched}} an attack on Cao Cao's position on the southern bank of the Yellow River, taking advantage of Cao's temporary absence.

50|$|A {{major factor}} {{that contributed to}} the Chinese Red Army's victory was that <b>the</b> local <b>warlords</b> were mainly {{concerned}} with Chiang Kai-shek and his plans to take over their territories, and they felt much less threatened by the Red Army's passing through. The area containing Luding bridge was controlled by <b>the</b> <b>warlord</b> Liu Wenhui (刘文辉), who fought the civil wars in Sichuan Province against his own nephew, <b>the</b> <b>warlord</b> Liu Xiang (刘湘). Liu Xiang managed to have nearly all of <b>the</b> other <b>warlords</b> in Sichuan join him in the struggle against his uncle. Chiang ostensibly remained neutral at the beginning of Sichuan's provincial conflicts in order to weaken <b>the</b> local <b>warlords</b> by letting them fight each other. Once <b>the</b> provincial <b>warlords</b> were weak and in disarray, Chiang's forces moved in and took over.|$|R
