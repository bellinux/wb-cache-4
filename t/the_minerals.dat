5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> {{may have been the}} result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.|$|E
5|$|Limestone, {{which is}} used to {{neutralize}} the acid drainage, can actually exacerbate the expansion problem by promoting sulfate–sulfate reactions that form <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> thaumasite and ettringite, which have even higher molar volumes.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to {{its unique}} appearance, Koenig {{assigned}} <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> {{as a new}} species. His description of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> appeared in an 1892 publication of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He named <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> paramelaconite from <b>the</b> Greek παρά, meaning [...] "near", and <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> melaconite (now known as tenorite), for its compositional similarity to melaconite. At the time, however, <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> was not recognized as a valid species.|$|R
50|$|In {{setting up}} the {{conditions}} for the swap the bill directs the Department of the Interior to reserve an overriding interest in {{a portion of the}} land being exchanged, namely that portion of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under <b>the</b> <b>Mineral</b> Leasing Act in <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> lands conveyed to Utah. The bill also requires Utah to reserve, for the benefit of its school trust, an overriding interest in that portion of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under <b>the</b> <b>Mineral</b> Leasing Act in <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> lands it relinquished to the federal government.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> is a deoxophylloerythroetio{{porphyrin}} (DPEP), with nickel {{occupying the}} center of the porphyrin ring. Most of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> consists of a C31 porphyrin with small quantities of a C30 norisomer. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> crystallizes in <b>the</b> triclinic crystal system.|$|R
5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|Albertite, {{a type of}} asphalt, {{was first}} found in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian {{geologist}} Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene. Over 200,000tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years. Large deposits of gypsum found eight kilometres (five miles) from the mining site were shipped around the globe as well. The Petitcodiac River {{was used as the}} primary means for transporting <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} in most of <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements {{it was not until}} the late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.|$|E
50|$|Cronstedt also {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> scheelite in 1751. He named <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> tungsten, meaning heavy stone in Swedish. Carl Wilhelm Scheele later {{suggested that a}} new metal could be extracted from <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> In English, this metal {{is now known as}} the element tungsten.|$|R
50|$|Whether <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> is {{primary or}} {{secondary}} {{depends on the}} mode of formation and not on <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> composition.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> {{is named}} after George P. Merrill (1854-1929) of the Smithsonian Institution. Merrill had {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> from four meteorites in 1915: the Alfianello, Dhurmsala, Pultusk, and Rich Mountain meteorites. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> was not recognized as distinct from whitlockite, however, by the IMA until 1975.|$|R
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|Economically {{important}} {{sources of}} boron are <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> colemanite, rasorite (kernite), ulexite and tincal. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including {{the provinces of}} Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir. Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in <b>the</b> <b>minerals.</b> They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
50|$|The dating {{method is}} usually {{performed}} on <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> zircon. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystal structure, but strongly rejects lead. Therefore, one {{can assume that}} the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic, i.e. it is produced solely by a process of radioactive decay after the formation of <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> Thus <b>the</b> current ratio of lead to uranium in <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> {{can be used to}} determine its age.|$|R
5000|$|The ore {{concentrate}} is first introduced into an IsaMill. This comminution step places {{a high degree}} of strain on <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> lattice and causes {{an increase in the number}} of grain boundary fractures and lattice defects of several orders of magnitude. The increase in the number of defects within <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> lattice [...] "activates" [...] <b>the</b> <b>mineral,</b> facilitating leaching. <b>The</b> rate of leaching is also enhanced, due to the increase in <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> surface area.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the atomic level {{structure}} of mineralized articular cartilage with heteronuclear solid-state NMR, our aims being to identify the inorganic species present at the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> crystals which may interact with the surrounding organic matrix and to determine which components of the organic matrix are most closely involved with <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> crystals. One-dimensional 1 H and 31 P and two-dimensional 1 H- 31 P heteronuclear correlation NMR experiments show that <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> component {{is very similar to}} that in bone with regard to its surface structure. 13 C{ 31 P} rotational echo double resonance experiments identify the organic molecules at <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> surface as glycosaminoglycans, which concurs with our recent finding in bone. There is also evidence of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues interacting with <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> However, other matrix components appear more distant from <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> compared with bone. This may be due to a larger hydration layer on <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> crystal surfaces in calcified cartilage...|$|R
5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it {{has historically been}} classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.|$|E
40|$|Thermogravimetry {{combined}} with evolved gas mass spectrometry {{has been used}} to characterise <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> ardealite and to ascertain the thermal stability of this ‘cave’ <b>mineral.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> ardealite Ca 2 (HPO 4) (SO 4) • 4 H 2 O is formed through the reaction of calcite with bat guano. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> shows disorder and the composition varies depending on the origin of <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> Thermal analysis shows that <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> starts to decompose over the temperature range 100 to 150 °C with some loss of water. The critical temperature for water loss is around 215 °C and above this temperature <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> structure is altered. It is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> starts to decompose at 125 °C, with all waters of hydration being lost after 226 °C. Some loss of sulphate occurs over a broad temperature range centred upon 565 °C. The final decomposition temperature is 823 °C with loss of the sulphate and phosphate anions...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> dachiardite honors his name. D'Achiardi {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> {{after it}} was discovered by his son in a granitic pegmatite.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990s Light element X-ray {{detectors}} {{are introduced}} improving <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> identification. <b>The</b> Julius Kruttschnitt <b>Mineral</b> Research Centre at the University of Queensland develops <b>the</b> <b>Mineral</b> Liberation Analyzer (MLA) expert software.|$|R
5|$|Thallium {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> crookesite TlCu7Se4, hutchinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lorándite TlAsS2. Thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and {{thallium}} is extracted as a by-product of roasting this mineral {{for the production of}} sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in <b>the</b> <b>minerals,</b> such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> present.|$|E
50|$|Anhydrous copper arsenate, Cu3(AsO4)2, {{is found}} in nature as <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> lammerite. Copper arsenate tetrahydrate, Cu3(AsO4)2.4H2O, occurs {{naturally}} as <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> rollandite.|$|R
40|$|The study {{carried out}} on <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> {{assimilation}} in saline environment by tomato and bean cultures allowed us to distinguish through the various studied stages, a specifi c assimilation of <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> element Ca, Mg, K, Na. This study aimed at looking at how assimilation rate of <b>the</b> studied <b>mineral</b> element. <b>The</b> dry matter is in relation with <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> composition of <b>the</b> plant organs...|$|R
5000|$|Streak: Performed {{by taking}} a {{porcelain}} plate and scratching <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> on it. <b>The</b> color of the streak can help you name <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b>|$|R
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} <b>the</b> <b>minerals</b> pyrochlore (the main commercial source for niobium) and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives {{approved}} the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 (H.R.6160). The approved legislation {{is aimed at}} restoring the U.S. as a leading producer of rare-earth elements, and would support activities in the U.S. Department of Energy (US DoE) to discover and develop rare-earth sites inside of the U.S. {{in an effort to}} reduce the auto industry's near-complete dependence on China for <b>the</b> <b>minerals.</b> A similar bill, the Rare Earths Supply Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010 (S. 3521), is being discussed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5000|$|... "Contour stripping" [...] {{involves}} {{removing the}} overburden above <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> seam near <b>the</b> outcrop in hilly terrain, where <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> outcrop usually follows the contour of the land. Contour stripping is often followed by auger mining into the hillside, to remove more of <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> This method commonly leaves behind terraces in mountainsides.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> ardealite Ca 2 (HPO 4) (SO 4) • 4 H 2 O is a ‘cave’ mineral and {{is formed}} through the {{reaction}} of calcite with bat guano. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> shows disorder and the composition varies depending {{on the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>mineral.</b> Raman spectroscopy complimented with infrared spectroscopy has been used to characterise <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> ardealite. <b>The</b> Raman spectrum is very different from that of gypsum. Bands are assigned to SO 42 - and HPO 42 - stretching and bending modes...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> has a white {{streak and}} a pale creamy yellow color. <b>The</b> <b>mineral</b> occurs as {{microscopic}} crystals, the largest found is 6 by 20 micrometers. It is a radioactive mineral, but not fluorescent. Upon heating for dehydration {{it is found}} that <b>the</b> <b>mineral</b> loses some of its SO2 at 600 to 800 °C.|$|R
