5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E

25|$|As far as {{repeated}} {{words are}} concerned, they are normally written separately (with a comma), but a hyphen is used if their connection {{is more than}} occasional (e.g. ki ‘who’ but ki-ki ‘everyone’). If a word is repeated with a different suffix or postposition, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> written separately (napról napra ‘day by day’, lit. ‘from day to day’), except if an element only exists in this phrase, in which case <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> written with a hyphen (régi ‘old’ réges-régi ‘ancient old’).|$|E

25|$|Writing {{was from}} right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which {{occasionally}} used boustrophedon. An example found at Cerveteri used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> continuous. From the sixth century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which symbol might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is sometimes difficult. Spelling might vary from city to city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|After the two {{series of}} homilies, he wrote three works to help {{students}} learn Latin, the Grammar, the Glossary and the Colloquy. In his Grammar, he translated the Latin grammar into English, creating what is considered the first vernacular Latin grammar in medieval Europe. In his glossary <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>are</b> not in alphabetical order, but grouped by topics. Finally, his Colloquy was intended {{to help students}} {{to learn how to}} speak Latin through a conversation manual. It is safe to assume that the original draft of this, afterwards maybe enlarged by his pupil and copyist, Ælfric Bata, was by Ælfric, and represents what his own scholar days were like.|$|E

Another ceremony called nouba, takes its name from Arabic for paroxysm or shift, as Sophi performers take turns at chanting and dancing to ritualistic hymns. There are also unique ceremonies to remember the dead and for occasions such as weddings.|$|E
