25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] coming here, to my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the days}} {{went by and}} nothing unusual happened, I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> joyfully, <b>that</b> {{experience}} was working the cure. I believed that soon a womanly scorn would heal effectually the wound which Sidney Sanderson had inflicted.|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> then <b>that</b> my fancy had vested {{her tone}} and look with a kindliness {{far beyond that}} which they contained, and as I thought of how I had deemed {{impatient}} the little gesture wherewith she had greeted Geneviève's interruption I laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the courage?" [...] {{repeated}} Allan. He {{paused a}} moment. [...] "Oh, I know!" [...] he resumed, putting his hand gayly on Midwinter's shoulder. [...] "You're still {{shy of the}} Milroys. What nonsense, when I <b>told</b> you <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> your peace was made at the cottage!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that,</b> being much less expensive, I would have a go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it was. When I was {{in church}} that morning I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I never, never, could be happy unless {{you came to}} me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{sent him}} reeling {{across the room}} till he fell in the corner. Then I walked out, closing the sitting-room door behind me,--out into the {{corridor}} {{and up the stairs}} into my own room. Then I locked and bolted my own door and looked at my watch. It was a quarter to three. I took a Bradshaw from my bookcase, packed a few clothes myself, set an alarm clock for seven o'clock in the morning, and turned into bed. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I would not think. I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> there was no such person in the world as Felicia, that she had never lived, that she was only part of this nightmare from which I was freeing myself! I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I would go to sleep, and I stayed awake until daylight. All the time there was only one thought in my brain! ...|$|E
60|$|She had {{scarcely}} stirred {{for nearly}} an hour, and I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> wearily, <b>that</b> I, too, might perhaps catch a little rest. The day had been a perpetual strain. I was not expecting or intending to sleep soundly, but I felt a merciful relief in lying quietly {{by the side of}} Marjorie.|$|R
60|$|Over {{and over}} again I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> bitterly, <b>that</b> when I had been near enough to the vessel which bore Bertha Nugent to {{converse}} with Mary Phillips {{without the aid of}} a speaking-trumpet, I should have tried to reach that vessel, no matter what the danger or the difficulties. I should have launched a raft--I should have tried to swim--I should have done something.|$|R

6000|$|... "No! I {{never did}} so till I had <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that,</b> if possible, {{you should be}} my own. Do you {{remember}} when you poked the fire for me at Hendon Hall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my lord. This is {{a matter}} in which I could obey no friend, no father. I have had to ask myself, and I have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I do not dare to love above my station in life." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{image of}} Edith Croyden filled my mind. In vain I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> {{she was a}} {{stranger}} to me: that--beyond her longitude--I knew nothing of her. In some strange way this girl had seized hold of me and dominated my senses.|$|E
6000|$|... "She has come. I {{have known}} she would, since that evening I saw her [...] on the mountain; {{and last night}} she came, and we have sat and looked [...] into each other's eyes. You will say, of course, that I am mad--that [...] I have not {{recovered}} from my fever--that I have been working too [...] hard--that I have heard a foolish tale, {{and that it has}} filled my [...] overstrung brain with foolish fancies: I have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> all <b>that.</b> [...] But the thing came, nevertheless--a creature of flesh and blood? a [...] creature of air? a creature of my own imagination?--what matter? it [...] was real to me.|$|R
2500|$|Luque {{was fined}} {{after a game}} against Feyenoord in November 2007 for a half-time altercation in the {{changing}} rooms with teammate Luis Suárez, which caused manager Adrie Koster to substitute them both before the second half. It was reported in July 2008 that the former had no future at Ajax; technical director Danny Blind told Sportweek: [...] "Ajax has told Luque {{that he has to}} leave the club. I <b>told</b> Albert <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> we don't want to go on with him and if I've told it to him, I really don't know who else I should inform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, I want you, {{now that}} you know my very ugly history, [...] to {{consider}} this. Whilst I was married, I was faithful to my [...] husband; since then I have been faithful to my self-respect. [...] But I have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> always <b>that</b> if ever the time came [...] when I should love, I would give <b>myself</b> to <b>that</b> man without [...] hesitation and without shame. And that time has come, dear. [...] You know that I love you! Your coming has been the great [...] awakening joy of my life.

60|$|This {{is exactly}} what {{happened}} after I regained the house. I went upstairs for a few minutes to arrange my hair and bathe my eyes. Then I walked straight down to the drawing-room, and I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I was prepared for anything that might take place.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{that moment}} Kearny tumbled from the steamer's side into the river. He could not swim, so the crew threw him a rope and drew him back aboard.

I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> although {{he might be a}} man to shun, he was also one to be admired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of it," [...] said Isabel,--"thought of it very often, till I have <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> conduct such as that would be inexpressibly base. What! to eat his bread after refusing him mine when it was {{believed}} to be so plentiful! I certainly have not face enough to do that,--neither face nor courage for that. There are ignoble things which require audacity altogether beyond my reach." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1897, after Bernstein {{delivered}} a lecture in Britain to the Fabian Society titled [...] "On What Marx Really Taught", Bernstein {{wrote a letter}} to the orthodox Marxist Bebel in which he revealed that he felt conflicted with what he had said at the lecture as well as revealing his intentions regarding revision of Marxism: as I was reading the lecture, the thought shot through my head that I was doing Marx an injustice, that it was not Marx I was presenting...I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> secretly <b>that</b> this could not go on. It is idle to reconcile the irreconcilable. The vital thing is to be clear as to where Marx is still right and where he is not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes indeed;--very well. He is a {{neighbour}} of {{mine and}} {{was in love with}} a girl, with all his heart; and he would have made her his wife and have been good to her. He had a home to offer her, and is an honest man with whom she would have been safe and respected and happy. Your brother saw her and, though he knew the story, though he had been <b>told</b> by <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> this honest fellow had placed his happiness on the girl's love, he thought,--well, I suppose he thought that such a pretty thing as this girl was too good for John Crumb.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to say to him,--nothing; not a word. He knows what he has to expect from me, for I have told him. He is acting with his eyes open, and so am I. If he marries Miss Crawley, he must live on his own means. I <b>told</b> him <b>that</b> <b>myself</b> so plainly, <b>that</b> he can want no further intimation." [...] Then Mrs. Grantly knew that she was absolved from the burden of yesterday's message, and she plumed herself on the {{prudence}} of her conduct.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said, 'yes. While I {{have you}} with me, and baby, I can bear anything. While you will tell me {{everything}} that happens, I will bear everything. And, John, when you were out just now, and when I am alone and trying to pray, I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I {{ought not to be}} unhappy; for I would sooner have you and baby and all these troubles, than be back at Chesterton--without you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had meant}} {{to ask you to}} be my wife; simply that. But you shall not have the pain of making me a {{positive}} refusal. As I rode here to-day I thought of it. During my frequent rides of late I have thought of little else. But I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I had no right to do it. I have not even a house in which it would be fit that you should live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have guessed. I {{have many}} times <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> your early life was {{superior}} to your position when I first met you. I think I may say without presumption that I recognize a lady by birth when I see her, even under reverses of an extreme kind. And certainly there is this to be said, that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Maddin was {{commissioned}} {{to produce an}} installation {{for the opening of}} the Toronto International Film Festival's Bell Lightbox, a cultural centre and skyscraper, and configured eleven screens to show a series of original short films. The films consisted of reimagined [...] "lost" [...] films by famous directors that have been lost, destroyed or unrealized. Maddin stated in the press that [...] "I’ve been literally haunted by the idea that there are these really intriguing titles by some of my favourite filmmakers that I’d never get to see and I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> years ago <b>that</b> the only way I’d get to see any version of these is if I made the adaptation myself." [...] The installation was also exhibited at Winnipeg's Platform Gallery from September 2 to October 2, 2011, for the WNDX Festival of Moving Image and at Concordia University's FOFA (Faculty of Fine Arts) Gallery from June 1-10, 2012.|$|R
6000|$|Frank and I turned instinctively {{toward the}} chimney, {{on hearing this}} unlooked-for interruption. The chair of Prudence was vacant, the woman having rushed from the hut at the first sound of the recent alarm; most {{probably}} in quest of her younger children. But Thousandacres remained in the very seat he had now occupied nearly, if not quite, two hours. I observed, however, that his form was not as erect as when previously seen. It had sunk lower in the chair, while his chin hung down upon his breast. Advancing nearer, a small pool of blood was seen on the stones beneath him, and a short examination <b>told</b> Malbone and <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> a rifle-bullet had passed directly through his body, in a straight line, and that only three inches above the hips! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In Rome I {{sometimes}} think of Wolfsegg and tell <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I {{have only to}} go back there in order to rediscover my childhood. This has always proved to be a gross error, I thought. You’re going to see your parents, I have often <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> the parents of your childhood, but all I’ve ever found is a gaping void. You can’t revisit your childhood, because it no longer exists, I <b>told</b> <b>myself.</b> The Children’s Villa affords the most brutal evidence that childhood is no longer possible. You have to accept this. All you see when you look back is this gaping void. Not only your childhood, but the whole of your past, is a gaping void. This is why it’s best not to look back. You have to understand that you mustn’t look back, if only for reasons of self-protection, I thought. Whenever you look back into the past, you’re looking into a gaping void. Even yesterday is a gaping void, even the moment that’s just passed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. I {{have tried}} myself, and now I {{think that it}} would not hurt me. There was a time in which I owned to myself that it would be very bitter, and then I <b>told</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>that</b> I hoped,--that I hoped that you would wait. But now, I have {{acknowledged}} to myself the vanity and selfishness of such a wish. If I really love you am I not bound to want what may be best for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wept {{the first}} six months almost without ceasing, and then I <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if I would be strong and resist I must weep no more.

5000|$|Eoghan Rua {{then became}} a spalpeen spailpín, or {{itinerant}} farm worker, until he was 31 years old. He then was forced to join the army under interesting circumstances. Ó Súilleabháin was then working for the Nagle family, a wealthy Anglo-Irish, but Catholic and Irish-speaking, family in Fermoy, County Cork. (The Nagles were themselves an unusual family. The mother of British politician Edmund Burke {{was one of these}} Nagles, as was Nano Nagle, the founder of the charitable Presentation order of nuns.) Corkery writes, [...] "I have had it <b>told</b> to <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> one day in their farmyard he heard a woman, another farm-hand, complain that she had need to write a letter to the master of the house, and had failed to find anyone able to do so. [...] "I can do that for you," [...] Eoghan said, and though misdoubting, she consented that he should. Pen and paper were brought him, and he sat down and wrote the letter in four languages—in Greek, in Latin, in English, in Irish. [...] "Who wrote this letter?" [...] the master asked the woman in astonishment; and the red-headed young labourer was brought before him; questioned, and thereupon set to teach the children of the house....Owing to his bad behavior he had to fly the house, the master pursuing him with a gun." [...] Legend says he was forced to flee when he got a woman pregnant-- some say it was Mrs. Nagle. (see Suantraí dá Mhac Tabhartha, which may relate to this incident).|$|R
