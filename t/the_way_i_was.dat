500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E

500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001 All Saints broke up, and Lewis later {{explained}} that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never {{in a million years}} have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over.

Regarding McCready, Cornell said, [...] "You almost kind of had to yell at him {{to get him to}} realize that in the five-and-a-half minute solo of 'Reach Down', that was his time and that he wasn't going to be stepping on anybody else." [...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in.

I was really emotionally drained from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him.

2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from Somerset, Close {{continued to play}} at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the wicket-keeper and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay, but Close {{would have none of it}} – he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: [...] "It's an honourable game and that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> brought up." [...] Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches.|$|E
2500|$|She remembered {{having a}} {{photographic}} memory as a child, {{making it easy}} to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests.

But that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E
2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kirwan {{shouldered}} {{much of the}} songwriting responsibility {{during this}} troubled and uncertain period for the band, through the changes in both the line-up and in musical style. The pressure showed in his health and he suffered problems with alcoholism; stories abound of Kirwan not eating for several days at a time, subsisting largely on beer. [...] He gradually became estranged from the other band members, and things {{came to a head}} during the autumn of 1972. Before a concert on that year's US tour, Kirwan and Welch rowed over tuning and Kirwan flew into a rage, banging his head and fists against the wall, then smashing his Gibson Les Paul guitar and refused to go onstage. Instead he watched {{while the rest of the}} band struggled through without him, and offered unwelcome criticism afterwards. Kirwan was sacked by Fleetwood, who had hitherto been the only other member still speaking to him. Fleetwood later said: [...] "It was a torment for him, really, to be up there, and it reduced him to someone who you just looked at and thought 'My God'. It was more a thing of, although he was asked to leave, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking at it was, I hoped, it was almost putting him out of his agony." [...] He later commented, [...] "I don't think he's ever forgiven me really." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} {{that can be}} found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, [...] "The Godfather was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired." [...] When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, [...] "I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do." [...] In a 2010 television interview with Larry King, Al Pacino also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie—despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him. Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton. In the Vanity Fair article [...] "The Godfather Wars", Mark Seals writes, [...] "With the actors, as in the movie, Brando served as the head of the family. He broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine. 'When we were young, Brando was like the godfather of actors,' says Robert Duvall. 'I used to meet with Dustin Hoffman in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if we mentioned his name once, we mentioned it 25 times in a day.' Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After hearing Vedder's tape, former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament invited Vedder {{to come to}} Seattle to {{audition}} for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time, Gossard and Ament {{were working on the}} Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomer Mike McCready were also a part of the project. The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell later said of Vedder that [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] Vedder would provide background vocals on several other songs as well. In April 1991, Temple of the Dog was released through A Records. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. Vedder said about the song in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead; [...] "I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – [...] because one, I didn't write it, and two, it was such a nice way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I'm indebted to Chris [...] time eternal for being invited onto that track." [...] On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on – or the most meaningful.” Vedder and Cornell performed the song together for the last time on October 26, 2014 at the Bridge School Benefit.|$|E
