25|$|Moral {{philosophers}} {{have defined}} discrimination as disadvantageous treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual {{need not be}} actually harmed {{in order to be}} discriminated against. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to be treated worse than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way {{despite the fact that the}} people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation. In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.|$|E

But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The real {{writers on}} the show had to fix them quite often a lot, because they were really quite amateurish. But they had nice thoughts, they had nice plots. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> fixing; the {{dialogue}} didn't work too well." ...|$|R

50|$|Similarly to Sartid's {{domestic}} campaign, {{the year}} in Europe started off glowingly. They quickly disposed of Welsh side Bangor City to reach the UEFA Cup first round where Ipswich Town was waiting. The hopes were further raised following a favourable away result 1-1, meaning <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> to keep a clean sheet at home to progress. However, the combination of Marcus Bent converting an early 9th-minute penalty and Sartid failing to score {{for the remainder of}} the match spelled painful elimination.|$|R

2500|$|Arthur is stunned, but {{continues}} {{trying to}} force Merlin to kill Mary Margaret, pushing Merlin to the limit, but the distraction gives Hook time to free himself and come at Arthur. After a brief scuffle, Hook knocks the sword away from Arthur and keeps him from grabbing it. Arthur runs off and releases Zelena, who teleports both of them away. Emma thanks Hook and heals a cut on his neck from Excalibur. He says that now they have the sword, so <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> to light the spark, and then {{they can get the}} darkness out of Emma. Back at Granny’s, Hook recounts the adventure to Henry, who is excited. David and Regina report back that Arthur has retreated far away and Emma is outside with the spark, trying to make it work. Regina comes out and she tells her that Rumplestiltskin's manifestation is playing with her, telling her she can’t light it because she’s not ready to give up the darkness, since she is still lured by it, even though she knows that it’s wrong. Regina grabs the dagger and commands Emma to tell her why she’s afraid to give up the darkness. Emma says that she can’t protect her family if she does. Regina says that’s not the truth, that it's only [...] "a wall," [...] and uses the dagger to continue probing her, trying to get her to admit the truth. Hook, David, and Mary Margaret come up, and Hook snatches the dagger from Regina, thinking that she's worsening the situation, while Emma storms off with the Dagger and the spark. Regina responds by telling them that she wasn’t being cruel; she was trying to help her find the truth, even it is painful.|$|E
50|$|When the Americans {{finally arrived}} in France, the allied commanders begged and pleaded for soldiers. They already had {{competent}} officers - <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> soldiers. The American commander General John J. Pershing refused to cannibalize {{any of his}} units nor send them into combat until they were ready. Instead he relinquished his black soldiers to their command. In return the allies {{put them on the}} hardest, dirtiest, and most dangerous missions they could think of. One of the black units, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, saw some of the toughest battles of the war.|$|R

In the {{original}} pilot [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles," [...] the luncheonette was known as Pete's, and featured a waitress named Claire (played by Lee Garlington); Claire was originally conceived as a regular for the show but was written out (and Pete's replaced by Monk's) by the time the show went to series.|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} also conducts {{interviews with}} Rastafari doctors, which shows Marley’s strict {{adherence to the}} religion. Rastafari doctor, Carleton Fraser, states that “doctors recommended amputation of the hip and removing the entire leg.” Chris Blackwell gives conflicting information and insists that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> to amputate Marley’s big toe for him to survive. Later, when Marley started losing his hair {{in the course of}} chemotherapy treatment for his cancer, family members also state that Marley had much displeasure in cutting off his dreadlocks, an aspect of Rastafarism, which was unfortunately necessitated by the physical pain their heavy weight was causing him.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to talk about something else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E

50|$|Human {{nature has}} an innate {{tendency}} towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed {{down to the}} last detail. This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society. True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments. Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others. This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not <b>need</b> cultivation, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness. The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism. Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as Ren.|$|R
5000|$|Following the 1997 Bottom stage tour, Hooligans Island, Mayall and Edmondson {{worked on}} the idea of a Bottom film in which Richie and Eddie run a hotel.

When Mayall came around he helped Edmondson complete the script while still in hospital. The film became Guest House Paradiso. In December 2004 the Daily Mirror newspaper quoted Edmondson as saying: [...] "It's definitely time to stop. We're getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn't as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous. ... We're both nearly 50 and we're starting to feel slightly undignified talking about wanking and knobs constantly."

Gough explains that, when casting for the role, they looked to Margot Kidder—Lois Lane in the Superman film series—for inspiration. They wanted an actress who was [...] "pretty", [...] "smart", and who came with some [...] "wit". Dozens of actresses auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, {{but it was not until}} a tape from Erica Durance showed up that everyone felt that they had found the right Lois. As executive producer Greg Beeman describes Durance, [...] "She had a toughness about her. She was tough and sexy and direct."
