25|$|The {{following}} season, with Young retired, {{and despite}} the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks (Giovanni Carmazzi {{in the third round}} and Tim Rattay in the seventh), Garcia kept the starting quarterback position and made his first Pro Bowl appearance. He set a new 49ers' team record with 4,278 passing yards in the 2000 season, although the team finished with a 6-10 record. Garcia finished the 2000 season, his first as a full-time starter with 31 <b>TD</b> <b>passes</b> to only 10 INTs.

25|$|After the Seahawks {{gained a}} {{surprise}} division title with a 7–9 regular season record {{and an even}} more miraculous playoff victory over the defending champion Saints, they headed to Chicago in the divisional round.

25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup Rex Grossman {{to the starting}} position.

25|$|The Redskins traded {{all their}} high level draft picks to St. Louis for taking Baylor QB Robert Griffin III #2 in the 2012 draft. Although {{the need for}} a {{franchise}} QB was obvious, many football experts doubted the wisdom of such a trade for one player. Griffin silenced his critics in Week 1 as Washington won a surprise upset over the Saints in New Orleans. The rookie QB threw for 320 yards and two <b>TD</b> <b>passes</b> in a 40-32 victory for the Redskins' highest scoring game since 2005.|$|E
25|$|Cutler {{took his}} first NFL snap on December 3 (Week 13), and after some initial jitters (0-3 with sack and fumble) {{completed}} his first touchdown to tight end Stephen Alexander in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, he threw a memorable 71-yard touchdown to fellow-rookie Brandon Marshall {{to tie the game}} 20–20. It was one of the longest <b>TD</b> <b>passes</b> for a debut in NFL history and was also the second-longest pass play between two rookies in Broncos history. He also had two interceptions and took three sacks in the loss.|$|E
25|$|Highlights of {{the season}} include Russell Wilson {{starting}} all games for Seattle, becoming the first rookie quarterback since Jim Zorn in their inaugural season to do so. Wilson finished the year tying the record for <b>TD</b> <b>passes</b> by a rookie quarterback with 26, a record he shares with Peyton Manning. His three TD runs in the Week 15 game against the Bills was also a franchise record.
