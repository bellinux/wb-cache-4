5|$|Filming {{took place}} in the Czech Republic. A {{stuntman}} died in an accident during the first weeks of filming. Besson was said to have become completely uncommunicative after the incident, only appearing on set <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> orders at people.|$|E
5|$|American actress Lauren Bacall (1924–2014) had an {{extensive}} career in films, television shows, and plays. She {{was one of}} the leading ladies during the Golden Age of Hollywood along with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth. Bacall started her career as a teenage fashion model when she appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar and was discovered by Howard Hawks' wife Nancy. As she naturally had a high-pitched and nasal voice, she received lessons to help deepen it and was required <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> verses by Shakespeare for hours every day as part of her training.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> at them.|$|E

50|$|Campbell famously {{clashed with}} Adam Boulton on Sky News about {{the result of}} the 2010 General Election, with the latter being reduced <b>to</b> <b>shouting</b> over both Campbell and the shows presenter.|$|R
50|$|While at his villa of Doué-la-Fontaine, Anjou, Louis {{received}} {{news of his}} father's death. He {{rushed to}} Aachen and crowned himself emperor <b>to</b> <b>shouts</b> of Vivat Imperator Ludovicus by the attending nobles.|$|R
5|$|Rik Mayall {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Peeves, a {{poltergeist}} who likes to prank students in the novel. Mayall had <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> his lines off camera during takes, but the scene ended up being cut from the film. David Bradley portrays Argus Filch, the loathed caretaker of Hogwarts. Tom Felton portrays Draco Malfoy, the trio's enemy. Zoë Wanamaker portrays Madam Hooch, the flying teacher of Hogwarts. Sean Biggerstaff portrays Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. James and Oliver Phelps appear as Fred and George Weasley, Ron's older twin brothers.

5|$|The firm {{acquired}} PR.com in 2001 and renamed it to OnPR, {{which later}} separated from Waggener in 2005. Later that year, the firm acquired consumer PR agency Maloney & Fox after working jointly {{with the firm}} on several Microsoft projects, such as the launch of Windows 95 and MSN internet services. Waggener Edstrom also moved its headquarters that year from Portland to Seattle and opened new offices in San Francisco, Paris, and Boston. The following year Waggener Edstrom acquired Hong Kong-based Shout Holdings, which was renamed <b>to</b> <b>Shout</b> Waggener Edstrom. Waggener opened an office in Brussels in 2006 {{in order to support}} the European Union. Waggener's Brussels office was later closed in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant Drascalo Fanchetti's hatchet-man, {{possibly}} XO. A one trick pony in {{that his}} dialogue {{is pretty much}} limited <b>to</b> <b>shouting</b> [...] "Silenceo!" [...] at every opportunity. Even the author makes note of this annoying trait...|$|R
50|$|Rage by a narcissist is {{directed}} towards {{the person that}} they feel has slighted them. This rage impairs their cognition, therefore impairing their judgment. During the rage, they are prone <b>to</b> <b>shouting,</b> fact distortion and making groundless accusations.|$|R
60|$|He strung his bow and, placing {{an arrow}} <b>to</b> the string, <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> the Aztecs {{that he should}} shoot unless they desisted from pursuit. They paid no attention, their officer <b>shouting</b> <b>to</b> them to press on. They were now {{less than a hundred}} yards behind.|$|R
5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point returning to the start. Set two months after the end of series one, Mark meets Becky in a newsagent, where he is purchasing pornographic magazines. He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor's house and breaks in using Tracy's keys. However, he is forced to hide under the bed when Becky and Trevor return home. Listening to them having sex, he becomes optimistic when he thinks that Becky begins <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> his name ("M..."). The name turns out to be Michael (Tony Gardner), Becky's solicitor with whom she is now cheating on Trevor.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the harvest}} districts {{west of the}} river all the towns were visited by swift-flying motor-cars that halted long enough for a warning <b>to</b> be <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> the citizens, [...] "Keep off the streets!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The boys began <b>to</b> stop, <b>shouting</b> <b>to</b> one another, [...] "Stop!" [...] "Stop!" [...] In a {{few minutes}} all was still again. The boys began to take their oars in {{and one of them}} rose and said, ...|$|R
50|$|Bolognese {{are easy}} to train but soon become bored by {{numerous}} repetitive drills. They thrive on variety so {{it is best to}} change or expand activities to keep them happily engaged and thinking. They respond well to positive reinforcement, gentle training methods and consistency. They do not respond well <b>to</b> <b>shouting</b> or harshness.|$|R
25|$|The {{image of}} Berenson defiantly {{shouting}} {{to the press}} continues to make her unpopular in Peru. Her supporters later claimed that her vehement defense of MRTA came about because she was angry over the treatment of a wounded cell mate {{and that she was}} instructed by authorities <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> in order to be heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} had {{a memorable}} and catchy theme song (as {{opposed to a}} theme tune, which has no words) which is still quoted today by people who reminisce about the programme, including a shouted section that is intended to encourage the audience <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> along. There have been several different edits of the same recording of the theme song over the years.|$|E
25|$|After {{application}} of drastic austerity measures in 2010, the Romanian economy recovered. Thus, in 2013, Romania recorded the highest {{economic growth in}} the EU. Despite this growth, the standard of living is decreasing, many Romanians being unable to endure everyday expenses. Poor working conditions, mass layoffs and tax hikes displease the population that is filling the squares of main cities <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> their grievances.|$|E
5000|$|McHenry has {{proposed}} two laws. McHenry's First Law states that 88% {{of all human}} behavior amounts <b>to</b> <b>shouting</b> [...] "Hey! Look at me!". McHenry's Second Law states that the flow of 'information' expands to fill any available channel, while actual knowledge remains scarce and available only to those willing to work at it.|$|R
60|$|Joel's {{simplicity}} and frankness vanished, {{and with them}} his rationality. He looked queer. His contrasting eyes shot little malignant gleams. He muttered incoherently, and moved back toward the skiff, making violent gestures, and his muttering grew <b>to</b> <b>shouting,</b> though still incoherent. He got in the boat and started to row back over the river.|$|R
60|$|Cowan {{gave me the}} one look, swore {{a mighty}} oath, and leaping <b>to</b> the port <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> Ray in a thundering voice what we were doing.|$|R
25|$|The Bell Telephone Company {{was created}} in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company {{engineers}} made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which {{emerged as one of}} the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> to be heard at the receiving telephone.|$|E
25|$|Joshua Wong {{and several}} Scholarism members {{attended}} the National Day flag raising ceremony on 1 October at the Golden Bauhinia Square, having undertaken not <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> slogans or make any gestures during the flag raising. Instead, the students faced {{away from the}} flag to show their discontent. Then District Councillor Paul Zimmerman opened a yellow umbrella in protest inside the reception after the ceremony. Protesters set up a short-lived fourth occupation site at a section of Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} Belisarius' {{outburst}} {{was at first}} unclear, but as the Goths approached the moat, he drew forth his bow and shot, one after another, three Ostrogoth riders. The soldiers on the walls took this as an omen of victory and started <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> in celebration. Then Belisarius revealed his thought, as he ordered his archers to concentrate their fire on the exposed oxen, which the Goths had so thoughtlessly brought within bowshot distance from the walls. The oxen were dispatched quickly, and the four towers were left there, useless, before the walls.|$|E
5000|$|Kravitz was {{reported}} <b>to</b> have <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> his comrades, [...] "Get {{the hell out}} of here while you can!" [...] When American troops retook their position, they found that Kravitz had killed a large number of enemy soldiers before dying in action.|$|R
60|$|No answer. The {{question}} was repeated, {{with the same}} result. <b>To</b> be <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> at night was evidently less of a novelty to Susan Tall's husband than to Matthew Moon. Oak flung down Tall's head into the corner again and turned away.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, the first mate was heard <b>to</b> be <b>shouting</b> orders.|$|R
25|$|Milner {{decided to}} make contact with the Chinese to ask for {{assistance}} in plotting a course for Macao. His efforts were unsuccessful; local fishing vessels simply sailed away whenever Prince of Wales approached. On 8 January Prince of Wales anchored off what may have been an island in the Wanshan Archipelago. Milner sighted a village by the beach and attempted to go ashore to ask for directions. Again he was rebuffed, with the villagers gathering on the beach <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> threats and beat gongs to raise an alarm.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with Ringelmann's first findings, Bibb Latané et al. replicated previous social loafing findings while demonstrating that the decreased performance of groups was attributable to reduced individual effort, {{as distinct from}} a deterioration due to coordination. They showed this by blindfolding male college students while making them wear headphones that masked all noise. They then asked them <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> both in actual groups and pseudogroups in which they shouted alone but believed they were shouting with others. When subjects believed one other person was shouting, they shouted 82% as intensely as they did alone, but with five others, their effort decreased to 74%.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 2006, during {{training}} camp, Jones {{was arrested in}} Murfreesboro, Tennessee for disorderly conduct and public intoxication at a nightclub after he spat on a woman he accused of stealing his wallet. Police said they ordered Jones to leave several times, but he refused, continuing <b>to</b> <b>shout</b> profanities at the woman. A judge granted him six months' probation on the conditions that he stayed out of further trouble {{and away from the}} nightclub. On October 26, 2006, Jones was cited for misdemeanor assault for allegedly spitting {{in the face of a}} female Tennessee State University student during a private party at Club Mystic, a Nashville nightclub. He was suspended by the Titans for one game.|$|E
2500|$|At one stage, 'Regan' shouts [...] "Mark it!", {{which is}} slang for {{following}} a suspect, {{but in this}} case, means [...] "market" [...] as 'Carter' drives erratically through a market place. 'Carter' tells 'Regan' <b>to</b> stop <b>shouting,</b> <b>to</b> which 'Regan' barks the reply [...] "I can't!".|$|R
5|$|Spiderland is {{the second}} and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was {{released}} on March 27, 1991, through Touch and Go Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word <b>to</b> <b>shouting,</b> the album contains narrative lyrics that emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|R
5000|$|On May 6, 1977, {{before the}} song's {{official}} release, Joel premiered it {{in a performance}} at C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University. Joel dedicated that performance to Christiano's, a restaurant in the nearby hamlet of Syosset, which operated until February 2014. Joel admitted, years later, that the <b>shout</b> out <b>to</b> the local restaurant was similar <b>to</b> <b>shouting</b> out [...] "Yankees" [...] at a Manhattan concert.|$|R
