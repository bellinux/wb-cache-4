5|$|T. m. caurinus breeds in {{southeast}} Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon. It winters from southwest British Columbia south to {{central and southern}} California and east to northern Idaho. It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark-headed. The white on the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer two tail feathers is restricted.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ears.|$|E

5|$|In the Indian Ocean, hawksbills are {{a common}} sight along {{the east coast of}} Africa, {{including}} the seas surrounding Madagascar and nearby island groups, and all along the southern Asian coast, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the coasts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are present across the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. Their Pacific range is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it extends from the southwestern <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago south to northern New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part}} of the wooden core of the bow.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toes.|$|E

5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|The spores are hyaline (translucent), smooth, and {{ellipsoid}} {{with the}} ends truncate. They have dimensions of 11.5–20 by 5–9µm, and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous cells interspersed among the asci, or spore-producing cells) are 5–8µm wide at the tip, branched, septate (with partitions that divide the cells into compartments), and constricted at the septa. The asci are cylindrical, and measure 300–360 by 10–13µm; the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asci stain blue with Melzer's reagent. The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
50|$|The female has {{dark brown}} {{iridescent}} wings, a white patch near <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings (called a pseudopterostigma) and a metallic green {{body with a}} bronze <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen.|$|R

5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized {{within a few days}} of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
30|$|In {{the upper}} arch, mesiodistal <b>tipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canines, premolars and molars {{displayed}} {{a very high}} accuracy index, {{not significantly different from}} 1. This was also true <b>of</b> vestibulolingual <b>tipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molars.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} {{important}} lighthouses on Miura Peninsula. Kannonzaki Lighthouse stands at <b>the</b> easternmost <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, facing Cape Futtsu across the bay. At Cape Tsurugi on <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southernmost <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula is the Tsurugisaki Lighthouse, one of Japan's oldest western style lighthouses, first illuminated in 1871.

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is high and}} {{triangular}} with a pointed apex, originating forward of the free rear <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is relatively large and originates over the anal fin. No ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are small and sickle-shaped, with pointed tips. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, each bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. Living finetooth sharks are a distinctive dark bluish-gray above and white below, with a faint pale stripe on the flanks and no prominent fin markings. Some individuals from Florida have green eyes. Males average 1.6m (5.2ft) in length and females 1.7m (5.4ft); the largest shark on record was 1.9m (6.2ft) long.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at the <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E

5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairs. The latus (side {{of the body}} between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and the underside is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; the underside becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
5|$|While {{features}} of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, {{features of}} the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans, which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaws were edentulous, or toothless, and probably supported a beak. The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It {{is more likely that}} they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{day is a}} {{piece of}} advice that is given daily. For example, many {{computer}} programs, such as those in older versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Microsoft Office suite, will display a <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day when they are started.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece and <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reed {{is known as}} the tip opening.
