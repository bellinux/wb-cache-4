5000|$|In 1999, {{in spite}} of the veto of the President, the Federal Assembly adopted the Act on the state policy on compatriots abroad.

However, this article was revoked in 2002 and persons under this article are not generally recognized by executive or court authorities of Russia as citizens of the Russian Federation unless they received documents of Russian citizenship before the article's revocation.

50|$|In the Author's Note of Steel Beach, Varley states: This story {{appears to}} be part of a future history of mine, often called the Eight Worlds. It does share background, characters, and {{technology}} with earlier stories of mine... What it doesn't share is a chronology. The reason for this is simple: the thought of going back, rereading all those old stories, and putting them in coherent order filled me with ennui... Steel Beach is not really part of the Eight Worlds future history. Or the Eight Worlds is not really a future history, since that implies an orderly progression of events. Take your pick. While there are small details throughout the series which do not match up, this is especially true of Steel Beach and its sequel.

50|$|Much of {{the rest}} of <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> moved to the page on {{automated}} trading systems. Such systems run strategies including market making, inter-market spreading, arbitrage, or pure speculation such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high-frequency trading (HFT), which are characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios. As a result, in February 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formed a special working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the CFTC on how best to define HFT. HFT strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information that is received electronically, before human traders are capable of processing the information they observe. Algorithmic trading and HFT have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure, particularly in the way liquidity is provided.|$|E

5000|$|More {{recently}} Dr. Smith {{has developed}} methods of running three-phase induction motors on single-phase power. He has also worked on methods of providing power to {{single phase supply}} lines from three phase generators. His first patent in this field, [...] "Three-Phase Induction Motor with Single-Phase Power Supply", , was issued 20 December 1988. He coined the words [...] "enabler" [...] and [...] "phaseable" [...] and [...] "semi-hex" [...] to distinguish these techniques from traditional static phase conversion, rotary phase conversion and electronic means of synthesizing three phase voltages and current. These techniques allow the use of large three phase motors up to over 100 hp where only single-phase power is available. Since 1976 all of his patents have been for devices to generate or conserve energy. Among his patents are designs of patents for solar generators, wind generators and high efficiency motors. That portion of the US patent database that is searchable by name (since 1975) lists 15 inventions by Dr. Smith in these fields. http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&p=1&f=S&l=50&Query=IN%2FSmith-Otto%24&d=PTXT Dr. Smith, by his own account, has published over 150 papers.

"Those {{who have}} {{recourse}} to lay {{power for the}} prevention of Apostolic Letters or Acts of any kind emanating from the Apostolic See or from its legates or delegates; those who directly or indirectly prohibit the promulgation of these acts or letters, or who, on the occasion of such promulgation, strike or terrify either the parties interested or third parties." [...] <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> compared with number 6 (above), from which it differs in that it protects, not all exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but that which the Holy See exercises in its official letters, it being eminently important to ensure the free communication of the faithful with Rome. The letters in question are: first, Apostolic Letters, in which the pope himself speaks, Bulls, Briefs, Encyclicals, etc.; second, the Acts of the Holy See emanating from Roman Congregations or other organs of the Curia, which constitute but one authority with the pope (Holy Office, January 13, 1892); finally, the acts of the official representatives of the pope, e.g. papal legates and delegates. The excommunication considers not only Letters that concern all the faithful, but also those regarding individuals, e.g. grants of benefices, dispensations, etc. This admitted, the penalty applies to three classes of persons, namely: those who resort to secular power, not only judicial but administrative, to prevent these Letters from being published or from producing their effect; those who, by means of authority, prevent such publication or execution; and finally, those who, on the occasion of these Letters, strike or terrify either the beneficiaries or even third parties who take part in their publication or execution. According to the more probable opinion, excommunication is incurred even if these measures of opposition do not produce the intended results.|$|E
