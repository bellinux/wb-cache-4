Microscopictraffic simulation {{is often used to}} evaluate the effects of operation strategies on <b>traffic</b> <b>performances.</b> In addition to the commonly used bus lane strategies, the dedicated bus lane (DBL),intermittent bus lane (IBL) strategies were also studied byVISSIM in this study.

50|$|More generally, the New Urbanism {{movement}} has offered {{criticism of the}} cul-de-sac and crescent (loop) street types not intended to network with each other. It {{has been suggested that}} such street layouts can cause increased traffic on the collector streets. It is recognized that cul-de-sac and looped streets inherently remove car traffic through them and restrict access to residents only. Resident traffic is naturally channelled to minor residential collectors and to arterials that provide inter-neighbourhood and inter-district connectivity. A study, reported in 1990, compared the <b>traffic</b> <b>performance</b> in a 700 acre development that was laid out using two approaches, one with and the other without hierarchy or cul-de-sac streets. It concluded that the non-hierarchical, traditional layout generally shows lower peak speed and shorter, more frequent intersection delays than the hierarchical pattern. The traditional pattern is not as friendly to the long trips as the hierarchical but friendlier to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout. A later similar comparative traffic study of about 830 acre concluded that all types of layouts perform adequately in most land use scenarios and that a refined hierarchical, dendrite network can improve <b>traffic</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Traffic Engineering {{describes}} {{techniques for}} optimising network performance by measuring, modelling, characterizing and controlling Internet <b>traffic</b> for specific <b>performance</b> goals [11]. This {{is a comprehensive}} definition. <b>Traffic</b> engineering <b>performance</b> goals typically {{fall into one of}} two categories. The first one is <b>traffic</b> related <b>performance</b> objectives such as minimizing packet loss, lowering end-to-end delay, or supporting a contracted Service Level Agreement (SLA). The second category is efficiency related objectives, such as balancing the distribution of traffic across available bandwidth resources. <b>Traffic</b> related <b>performance</b> goals are set in order to meet contracted service levels and offer competitive services to customers. Efficiency related goals, are required by the service provider to minimize the cost of delivering services, especially the cost of utilizing expensive network resources. The objective of this thesis is to present a description of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) architecture and its functionality to achieve a tool for performing traffic engineering and QoS support. We simulate traffic engineering with MPLS on a simple network and measure its performance. We analyse measurements related to queuing delay, throughput and other traffic related issues. We then move on fine-tuning the MPLS-TE network to also take into consideration QoS support when aggregating flows through a single label- switching path. We combine differentiated services with MPLS architecture in order to support QoS requirements. The simulation tool used in this thesis is called OPNET Modeler version 8. 11...|$|R
50|$|A study {{compared}} the cost efficiency of three network patterns {{in improving the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>performance</b> of a district. It first established {{the cost of the}} network system of each before evaluating the efficiency ratio for the resulting traffic improvement. The analysis showed that the most significant capital cost of development is for roads. The conventional layout has the lowest capital costs for roads followed by the fused grid at 12% higher and the Neo-traditional (grid) layout at 46% higher. When considering the opportunity cost for land dedicated to right-of-ways (ROW), the fused grid allocated 9% more land to roads than the conventional grid, while the neo-traditional grid allocated 43% more. Similar to capital costs, roads remain the key cost component of community development after accounting for on-going operations, maintenance, and replacement costs.|$|E

The traditional pattern is not as friendly to the long trips as the hierarchical but friendlier to short trips. Local trips in it are shorter in distance but about equivalent in time with the hierarchical layout.A later more extensive comparative traffic study [...] of a subdivision about 830 acres (3.4 km2) tested three types of layouts, a conventional, a TND and a Fused Grid. It also tested the resilience of all three layouts to an increased traffic load generated by increased residential densities.The study concluded that all types of layouts perform adequately in most low to moderate population density scenarios up to a certain threshold of 62 persons per hectare (ppha). As densities increased beyond the threshold so did travel time. At a 50 percent density increase to 90 ppha, the conventional hierarchical pattern showed the highest increase in travel time (20%), followed by the TND (13%) and the fused grid (5%). When the density increased further to include one local job per 2 residents, delays increased by 139%, 90% and 71% for the conventional, traditional and fused grid respectively. This outcome confirms the density influence on congestion levels and that a hierarchical pattern, if laid out following the access restrictions proposed in the ITE/CNU practice guide, can improve flow.|$|E

A suitable traffic model of the whole system is also derived after due considerations of the handover process. The system performance measures include new call blocking prob-ability, call dropping probability, and mean number of handovers per call. A computer simulation is developed and used.
