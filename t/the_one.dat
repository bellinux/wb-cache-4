5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners {{to pay more}} than US$13 million for the site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to the south side of <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E
