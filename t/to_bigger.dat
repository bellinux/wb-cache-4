25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E

Hashemitaba said Iran is plagued with severe environmental crisis. The third hopeful, incumbent Rouhani, said that immigration <b>to</b> <b>big</b> cities is a major problem not only in Iran but in most countries. He added that unemployment and low income are major reasons behind immigration <b>to</b> <b>big</b> cities. Ghalibaf, for his part, said social and economic imbalance is a major reason behind immigration. Jahangiri said attention <b>to</b> immigrants <b>to</b> <b>big</b> cities must be the first priority in tackling their problems. Raisi said the first priority is to have correct figures on immigration <b>to</b> <b>big</b> cities. While Ghalibaf put the number of outskirts dwellers at 11 million, Raisi said the figure belongs to four years ago and currently stands at around 16 million.|$|R

25|$|The new Fronte was a {{big step}} away from the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|However, others {{attribute}} {{the decline of}} deaf clubs {{to the end of}} World WarII and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move <b>to</b> <b>bigger</b> cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World WarII ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.|$|E
25|$|Nissan and Audi {{had success}} with all-wheel drive in road racing with the former's {{advent of the}} Nissan Skyline GT-R in 1989.

Most controversially was the win pulled off at the 1990 Macau Grand Prix where the car led from start to finish. Audi's dominance in the Trans-Am Series in 1988 was equally controversial as it led to a weight penalty mid season and to a rule revision banning all-AWD cars, its dominance in Super Touring eventually led to a FIA ban on AWD system in 1998.|$|E
