60|$|He {{leaned forward}} <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> which had started between Lady Underhill {{and some friends}} she had {{discovered}} in the seats in front; and Jill, turning, became aware that the man on her right {{was looking at her}} intently. He was a big man with rough, wiry hair and a humorous mouth. His age appeared to be somewhere in the middle twenties. Jill, in the brief moment in which their eyes met, decided that he was ugly, but with an ugliness that was rather attractive. He reminded her of one of those large, loose, shaggy dogs that break things in drawing-rooms but make admirable companions for the open road. She had a feeling that he would look better in tweeds in a field than in evening dress in a theatre. He had nice eyes. She could not distinguish their colour, but they were frank and friendly.|$|E
60|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the repast, during which I had been too much occupied to take notice of everything that passed, I observed that a number of small birds had flown in, and were briskly hopping over the floor and tables, also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or shoulders of the company, and that they were being fed with the fragments. I took them to be sparrows and things of that kind, but they did not look altogether familiar to me. One little fellow, most lively in his motions, was remarkably like my old friend the robin, only the bosom was more vivid, running almost into orange, and the wings and tail were tipped with the same hue, giving it quite a distinguished appearance. Another small olive-green bird, which I at first took for a green linnet, was even prettier, the throat and bosom being of a most delicate buff, crossed with a belt of velvet black. The bird that really seemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut, with a white throat and mouse-colored wings and tail. These pretty little pensioners systematically avoided my neighborhood, although I tempted them with crumbs and fruit; only one flew onto my table, but had no sooner done so than it darted away again, and out of the room, as if greatly alarmed. I caught the pretty girl's eye just then, and having finished eating, and being anxious <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> for I hate to sit silent when others are talking. I remarked that it was strange the little birds so persistently avoided me.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Stenson for {{a moment}} hesitated. He seemed {{uncertain}} whether or no <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Finally, impulse swayed him.|$|R
6000|$|Monsieur Duchesne {{came home}} as usual just at sunset. Nat noticed that at dinner he was evidently preoccupied, though he endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> as cheerily as usual. After the ladies {{had left the}} table he said: ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2014, the project {{launched}} the Planet Forward University Consortium, a program that allowed other universities {{from across the country}} <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> to help address sustainability challenges through storytelling. Middlebury College, Roger Williams University, the University of Arizona and the University of California, Berkeley are some of the current participants.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard you}} muttering such {{pleasant}} words, Monsieur," [...] continued Blakeney calmly, [...] "that the temptation seized me <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> A man {{talking to himself}} is ever in a sorry plight... he is either a mad man or a fool..." ...|$|R

60|$|The Baroness {{turned in}} her chair as though anxious <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> At that moment came {{a knock at the}} door of the box. Wrayson rose and opened it. Heneage stood there and entered at once, as though his coming were the most natural thing in the world.|$|R

With co-host Mark Young, Woolery expands on his political ideals and current events, often inviting guest experts <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shamroy once noted: [...] "The {{obtrusive}} {{camera is}} like a chattering person—something we can do without. It's okay for the camera <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> so to speak, but it must never dominate. It must never distract from the story. The real art of cinematography lies in the camera's ability to match the varied moods of players and story, or {{the pace of the}} scene." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Blades and Nanette Fondas co-authored The Custom-Fit Workplace {{published}} by Wiley. A practical guide {{for making the}} workplace more profitable and a better fit for employees, the book describes work practices like flexible work, virtual work, high-commitment work, non-linear career paths and babies at work. MomsRising.org launched a companion to the book on Labor Day 2010 to encourage supporters of custom-fit work environments <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> about transforming work culture.|$|E
60|$|While {{this short}} {{dialogue}} was going on, {{the gentleman who}} had enacted the savage, came up, with his walking shoes on his feet, and his slippers in his hand, to within a few paces, as if desirous <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Deeming this a good opportunity, he put in his word.|$|R
60|$|Miles {{felt that}} it would be {{inappropriate}} in him to remain or <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> With a heart full of disappointment and indignation he retired, and sought refuge in the darkest recesses of the pantry, to which he was welcome at all times, being a great favourite with the steward.|$|R

50|$|APTN InFocus reformatted {{again in}} 2016, {{becoming}} a one-hour show, interactive as Contact had been {{but with a}} new focus on social media. The first episode on June 3, 2016 featured Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a guest. It {{was the first time}} a serving Prime Minister ever gave a sit-down interview to an Indigenous media organization. Trudeau took question via telephone and twitter for an hour. The current design of the show usually features a three guest panel, and allows viewers <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> via telephone twitter or Facebook.|$|E
50|$|As {{the acts}} of civil disobedience continued, {{students}} began to meet and be acquainted with each other from the protests. Some students were particularly upset with the treatment of Latino student interests and issues. A small group of these students began to meet at the Livingston Student Center and discuss {{the formation of an}} organization that would help students meet their goals and provide a family away from home. As the discussion continued, more men began <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> eventually the group reached 20 members. Most of these men had met, at some time or another, during the protests or acts of civil disobedience, and thus shared common interests in the need for taking action to bring about positive change.|$|E
60|$|He {{poured himself}} out {{another glass of}} beer and resumed his supper with relish. <b>Conversation</b> turned on <b>the</b> weather, and from that {{to the price of}} potatoes. Frantic efforts on the part of <b>the</b> {{prisoner}} <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> and give it a more personal turn were disregarded. Finally he began to kick with monotonous persistency on the door.|$|R
60|$|Mother {{had made}} no attempt <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> Her pale face and quivering lips told that she was {{thinking}} of that time, only such a short distance in the past, when father had been in the clutches of those who at that moment thirsted for our blood, and grief overshadowed all the fears which the future could present.|$|R
50|$|An {{immediate}} {{variation of}} this is to have only two chairs in the central group. When someone in <b>the</b> audience wants <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> two-way <b>conversation,</b> they come forward and tap the shoulder of the person they want to replace, at some point when they are not talking. The tapped speaker must then return to the outer circles, being replaced by the new speaker, who carries on <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> in their place.|$|R
50|$|Shigematsu's {{life has}} changed during his years {{studying}} in Waseda University School of Education. Katsumi Togo (東郷 克美 Tōgō Katsumi) was his mentor. Since his third year of study, he worked as an editorial staff for Waseda University's literary journal, Waseda bungaku. At that time, Kenji Nakagami was the mentor of the editorial department. Shigematsu once mentioned that his works showed the influence of Nakagami. In fact, Shigematsu seldom read any books until he became the editorial staff of the journal, and thus he could barely involve in the members' conversation. He therefore every time memorised {{the names of the}} writers and titles of the novels they mentioned, and searched in libraries and book stores afterwards. He spent most of his money he got from the scholarship on books and read as much as he could, in the hope that he would be able <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> one day.|$|E
50|$|With Scotsman Jim Clark in a Lotus-Ford closing on Jones in {{the waning}} laps, Jones' car {{developed}} a horizontal crack in the external oil reservoir. At that moment, driver Eddie Sachs crashed on the oil-slickened racing surface and brought out a yellow caution flag, slowing the field. Agajanian, Jones' car owner, argued with chief steward Harlan Fengler not to issue a black flag, insisting the oil level had dropped {{below the level of}} the crack, and that the leak had stopped. As Agajanian pleaded with Fengler, Lotus head man Colin Chapman rushed up <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> and demanded that Fengler follow the rules about disqualifying cars with oil leaks. With the end of the race just minutes away, Fengler took no action, and Jones went on to win. The Lotus-Ford team, while unhappy with the obvious favoritism displayed by race officials toward Jones and Agajanian, also acknowledged Jones' clear superiority in the event. In addition, Ford officials recognized that a victory through disqualification of Clark's biggest competitor would not be well received by the public, so they declined to protest.|$|E
50|$|K. is {{visited by}} his uncle, who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic, he becomes {{concerned}} that K. is underestimating {{the seriousness of}} the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer, who is attended by Leni, a nurse, whom K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings: guilt is assumed, the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels, and everything is secret, from the charge, to the rules of the court, to the authority behind the courts - even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K., but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown, it is difficult work. It also never may be read, but is still very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behind the scenes. As they talk, the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> but K. is called away by Leni, who takes him to the next room, where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside, who is angry, claiming that K.'s lack of respect has hurt K.'s case.|$|E
60|$|No second bidding was necessary, {{and five}} minutes later the two boys were enjoying {{a greater degree of}} comfort than they had ever fancied would be possible, Seth refusing <b>to</b> <b>join</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> which his partner would have started, in order to give himself wholly up to {{building}} air-castles, all based on the Fire Department with himself rising from the grade of recruit to that of battalion-chief.|$|R
40|$|Tourists are {{increasingly}} connecting in online social networks (OSN) where they share content and coconstruct narratives of tourist destinations through their shared tourism experiences. The destinations give tourists a stage {{to act on}} where they perform a desirable self. Thus, their performances and performative acts reflect on how destinations are represented. This poses a challenge for destination management organisations (DMOs). They {{have to find ways}} <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> of OSN users to influence perception of their destination. It is believed that DMOs ought to build alliances with tourists by empowering them to co-construct brand narratives and aligning their storytelling with DMOs’ preferred narratives. This research aims to assess the role of storytelling in mediating tourism experiences in order to identify ways for DMOs to build alliances to strengthen destination narratives. It examines a range of different storytellers and how they reinforce and undermine preferred narratives of DMOs, and how they might write different stories across different types of OSN due to their performativity. The practices and strategies DMOs adopt to strengthen storytelling in OSN are also examined...|$|R
