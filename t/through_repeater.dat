40|$|We propose various low-latency spatial encoder {{circuits}} {{based on}} bus-invert coding for reducing peak energy and current in on-chip buses with minimum penalty on total latency. The encoders are implemented in dual-rail domino logic with interfaces for static inputs and static buses. A spatial and temporally encoded dynamic bus technique is also proposed for higher performance targets. Comparisons to standard on-chip buses of various lengths with optimal repeater configurations at the 130 nm node show the energy-delay and peak current-delay design {{space in which}} the different encoder circuits are beneficial. A 9 mm spatially encoded static bus exhibits peak energy gains beyond that achievable <b>through</b> <b>repeater</b> optimization for a single cycle operation at 1 GHz, with delay and energy overhead of the encoding included. For throughput constrained buses, the spatially encoded static bus can provide up to 31 % reduction in peak energy, while the spatially and temporally encoded dynamic bus yields peak current reductions of more than 50 % for all bus lengths...|$|E

Each segment supports a number of users who can communicate with each other using a multiaccess protocol. The performance evaluation of the above situation is difficult because the assumptions which are used in the classical approach cannot be used here.

They examine a two-segment environment, but a few modifications suffice to analyze a multisegment environment...|$|R
5000|$|A {{collision}} domain is {{a section of}} a network connected by a shared medium or <b>through</b> <b>repeaters</b> where data packets can collide with one another while being sent. The {{collision domain}} applies particularly in wireless networks, but also affected early versions of Ethernet. A network collision occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time. Members of a collision domain {{may be involved in}} collisions with one another. Devices outside the collision domain do not have collisions with those inside.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{practical}} yet accurate approach {{for dealing with}} the problem of inserting repeaters along on-chip interconnect lines to meet delay and transition time requirements. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} the transition time and the delay at the far end of an interconnect segment are, respectively, independent and linearly dependent on the driving repeater's input transition time, as long as the ratio of the output to input transition time does not exceed a pre-defined value. In this context, we first derive simple closed form expressions for the optimal repeater spacing and sizing. Then, we propose a bottom-up "pseudo" hierarchical quadratic programming method for inserting and sizing repeaters in RC interconnects. This method, unlike Van Ginneken's [30], although largely based on it, is able to account for transition times at every potential repeater insertion point along the RC line of interest. The resulting technique can be readily incorporated in a more general RC network optimization scheme (<b>through</b> <b>repeater</b> insertion) where, eventually, wire sizing can be formulated either as an objective or a constraint. Accurate moment matching techniques for computing the RC delays and transition times are used in addition to an accurate CMOS inverter/repeater delay model that takes into account short channel effects that are prevalent in deep submicron (DSM) technologies. In particular, a new delay metric, based on the first two moments of the impulse response of the interconnect RC circuit, is derived. Also, a new empirical ramp approximation that takes into account the inherent asymmetry of signals in signal distribution networks in DSM technologies is presented...|$|E
5000|$|The basic NXDN {{channel is}} digital {{and can be}} either 12.5 kHz or 6.25 kHz wide. 6.25 kHz dual-channel systems can be {{configured}} to fit within a 12.5 kHz channel. This effectively doubles the spectrum efficiency compared to an analog FM system occupying a 12.5 kHz channel. The architecture of NXDN is such that two NXDN channels, within a 12.5 kHz channel for example, can be allocated as voice/voice, voice/data, or data/data. As of 2012, this capability cannot be implemented in commercially available hardware on simplex or [...] "talkaround" [...] frequencies, but only <b>through</b> <b>repeaters.</b>|$|R

40|$|Multi-Processor (MP-SoC) {{platforms}} {{are emerging}} as the latest trend in SoC design.

Systems having multiple smaller buses, integrated <b>through</b> <b>repeaters</b> or bridges, are possible alternatives. But these kinds of solutions are ad-hoc in nature. By adopting a more structured network-based design paradigm, specific clock cycle requirements can easily be met. The precise focus of this paper is to show how the butterfly fat tree (BFT) can meet this objective when used as the overall MP-SoC interconnect architecture, thereby offering an attractive alternative for SoC interconnect that does not suffer from the non-scalability aspect of the buses in regards to the clock cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Generally, small {{networks}} are often called as LAN (Local Area Network). A LAN is a network allowing {{easy access to}} the computers or peripherals. Networking means interconnection of computers. These computers can be linked together for different purposes and using a variety of different cabling types. Thus leading to less wastage of time and hence increased productivity. LAN mainly depends on the characteristics and the factors such as Topology, Medium Access Control (MAC) and Transmission Medium. This provides the security. LAN has Ethernet. LAN mainly works on the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). The Ethernet specification performs the same functions as the OSI physical and Data Link Layer of data communications. Wired LANs transmit the data but these are physically connected <b>through</b> <b>repeaters</b> and bridges and Wireless LANs transmit and receive data over air, without the use of any cable. These are physically not connected...|$|R

5000|$|Wireless range-extenders or {{wireless}} repeaters {{can extend}} {{the range of}} an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected <b>through</b> <b>repeaters</b> will suffer from an increased latency for each hop, {{as well as from}} a reduction in the maximum data throughput that is available. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case where but a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting very low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases where but a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Additionally, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain will have a data throughput that is also limited by the [...] "weakest link" [...] existing in the chain between where the connection originates and where the connection ends. Networks employing wireless extenders are also more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The VHF radio can {{overcome}} line-of-sight transmission by “repeaters, ” which pick up weak signals, amplify and retransmit {{them on a}} different frequency. However, repeaters can interfere with each other unless they are far enough apart or transmit on sufficiently separated frequencies. In this paper, we propose such a system using the continuous tone-coded squelch system (CTCSS) to mitigate interference problems. This system associates to each repeater a separate sub-audible tone that is transmitted by all users who wish to communicate <b>through</b> that <b>repeater.</b> The repeater responds only to receive signals with its specific tone...|$|R

Although the repeater site must be capable of simultaneous reception and transmission (on two different frequencies), mobile stations can operate in one mode at a time, alternating between receiving and transmitting; so, mobile stations do not need the bulky, and costly filters required at a repeater site. Mobile stations may have an option to select a [...] "talk around" [...] mode to transmit and receive on the same frequency; this is sometimes used for local communication within range of the mobile units.|$|R
