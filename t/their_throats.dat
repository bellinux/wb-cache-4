5|$|By {{the time}} of Ruler 8's successor, Uh Chapat, Toniná was clearly in decline. Only a single event, in 837, can be dated to his reign, {{although}} a stucco mural depicting captives with garrottes at <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> may belong to his period of rule.|$|E
5|$|Genevieve Lhermitte is a Belgian {{woman who}} killed all her five {{children}} on February 28, 2007. She killed each of her children by slitting <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> with a kitchen knife stolen from a local grocery store while her husband was visiting family in Morocco. After Lhermitte killed her children, she then tried to kill herself. The suicide attempt failed, and Lhermitte {{was taken into custody}} and charged with first-degree murder. She was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of May, the troops of the Montenegrin National Army {{surrendered}} to the British and were quickly turned back into Yugoslavia and {{into the hands of the}} communists. Drljević managed to evade capture, and he and his wife sought refuge at a camp for displaced persons in the Austrian town of Judenburg. On 10 November 1945, three of Đurišić's followers discovered them there and murdered them by slitting <b>their</b> <b>throats.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} continues, {{and after}} the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering; Beeman discovers a severed finger in his sandwich, recognizing from its ring that it belonged to Niederman. When the sheriff shuts down production, Black theorizes that the killer may target the crew's hotel; he and Hollis arrive to find {{the body of the}} film's publicist hanging from a rope. The next day, a film extra (Gene Simmons) confesses to the killings; Black pokes holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed—and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> cut, while Winston's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder-suicide.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on <b>their</b> <b>throats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of <b>their</b> <b>throats,</b> allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|In September 1839, Juan Lavalle {{returned}} {{after ten years}} in exile. He allied with the governor of Corrientes, which revolted once again, and invaded Buenos Aires province {{at the head of}} Unitarian troops armed and supplied by the French. Emboldened by Lavalle's actions, the provinces of Tucumán, Salta, La Rioja, Catamarca and Jujuy formed the Coalition of the North and also rebelled against Buenos Aires. Great Britain intervened on behalf of Rosas, and France lifted the blockade on 29 October 1840. The struggle with his internal enemies was hard-fought. By December 1842, Lavalle had been killed and the rebellious provinces subdued, except for Corrientes, which was only defeated in 1847. Terrorism was also employed on the battlefield, as the Rosistas refused to take prisoners. The defeated men had <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> cut and their heads put on display.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> after killing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
50|$|Males {{are dark}} grey on their beak, eyes, legs and upper {{body with a}} white lower body. Females differ from males by having a more grayish upper body and light orange around <b>their</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
25|$|They do not {{normally}} use audible speech to communicate, {{though they are}} capable of it. Instead, they subvocalize, using their technology to carry their speech among them. When they subvocalize, <b>their</b> <b>throat</b> muscles twitch noticeably.|$|R
50|$|The great crested flycatcher {{does not}} display sexual dimorphism. All adults are {{brownish}} on the upperparts with yellow underparts; {{they have a}} long rusty brown tail and a bushy crest. <b>Their</b> <b>throat</b> and breast are grey.|$|R
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on <b>their</b> <b>throats.</b> The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

25|$|Victims {{were often}} killed by having <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> torn out. The Kingdom of France used a {{considerable}} amount of manpower and money to hunt the animals, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, civilians, and a number of royal huntsmen.|$|E
25|$|This lizard {{displays}} polymorphism {{with varying}} colors of <b>their</b> <b>throats.</b> The throat colors range from white and gray to bright colors of red, orange, or blue. The diversity in throat color {{is due to}} a combination of sexual selection and natural selection.|$|E

50|$|While {{resistance}} to the Raiders' actions could prove deadly, it also was sometimes effective. Victims - particularly new inmates - would often be awoken {{in the middle of}} the night with a knife to <b>their</b> <b>throat,</b> with <b>their</b> attackers threatening to cut <b>their</b> <b>throat</b> if they moved. Nevertheless, some victims succeeded in defending themselves from these attacks and escaping. John McElroy describes one such event, in which a young man was attacked by eleven Raiders but managed to escape by hitting one of his attackers in the head with a spade; the attacker was knocked down and his fellow Raiders retreated. It was common for the Raiders to retreat as soon as they realized a form of significant resistance was at hand.|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemic}} of infections due to group A Streptococcus haemolyticus type 12 originated in an infant with bronchiectasis, and involved children and nurses. Some {{of the children}} spread contagion; the nurses did not spread contagion. The children who spread contagion had few or no recognizable type 12 organisms in their throats; most of the nurses had type 12 predominant in <b>their</b> <b>throat</b> flora. Two children who spread contagion had non-hemolytic streptococci in <b>their</b> <b>throat</b> flora, which became hemolytic on cultivation and proved to be type 12. Four children had in <b>their</b> <b>throat</b> flora hemolytic type 12 streptococci which became non-hemolytic when grown in fluid media containing serum. These infants appeared to act as disseminating hosts in which the pathogen developed communicability {{and at the same}} time became morphologically and physiologically labile. The labile streptococci gave rise to atypical forms whose requirements for rapid reproduction (as tested in vitro) were similar to those existing in the human host. The hypothesis presented is that the genesis of communicability depends on the coexistence of two conditions: a transmitting host lacking in restraining influences, permitting the acquisition of physiological lability by the microorganism; and the development of adaptive mechanisms in the bacterial cell, facilitating survival under atmospheric conditions and subsequent colonization in the environment of human tissues...|$|R
25|$|A {{scientist}} {{tested the}} effects of Binaca breath spray on an Intoxilyzer 5000. He performed 23 tests with subjects who sprayed <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> and obtained readings as high as 0.81—far beyond lethal levels. The scientist also noted that {{the effects of}} the spray did not fall below detectable levels until after 18 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeling in}} many {{quarters}} {{was that when}} the Australian Board first found Packer at <b>their</b> <b>throats,</b> {{the rest of the}} cricket world supported them to the hilt; even to the extent of highly expensive court cases which cricket could ill afford. Now, when it suited Australia, they had brushed their friends aside to meet their own ends.|$|E
25|$|Autopsies {{revealed}} that <b>their</b> <b>throats</b> had been slit {{from ear to}} ear with such force that they were nearly decapitated. The bodies had been left covered with thousands of dollars' worth of marijuana (seven pounds of marijuana; in what investigators described as a symbolic gesture) and thousands of dollars of cash, in three different rooms. Police found $5,000 in cash at the scene, which suggested that robbery was not the motive.|$|E
