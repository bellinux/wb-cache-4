5|$|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was {{concerned}} that, given <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe {{at the end}} of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians have stressed <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E
5|$|Kelly's wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, {{was shot}} in an {{assassination}} attempt on January 8, 2011, putting Kelly in the national spotlight. On February 4, Kelly described the previous month as the hardest time of his life; and he expressed his gratitude for <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> outpouring of support, good wishes and prayers for his wife. He said that he believed people praying for her helped.|$|E

5|$|Problems with moving {{dunes and}} {{desertification}} were subsequently {{brought under control}} in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by establishing large plantations of grasses, bushes and fir trees.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>enormous</b> {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been {{recognized}} since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, {{one of which is}} the predominant calendar in use today.|$|E
5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. <b>The</b> <b>enormous</b> amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so {{it is likely that}} the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E

5|$|Venom in {{snakes and}} some lizards {{is a form}} of saliva that has been {{modified}} into venom over its evolutionary history. In snakes, venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey, as well as to perform other diet-related functions.

5|$|Wazir Khan mosque {{is renowned}} for its {{elaborate}} embellishment in a style which draws from the decorative traditions from several regions. While other monuments in Lahore from the Shah Jahan period feature intricate kashi-kari tile work, none match <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> scale of the Wazir Khan Mosque.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E

5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> {{response}} to Myst, work quickly {{began on the}} next Myst game. Cyan moved from their cramped garage to a new office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year. Development costs were between $5 and $10 million, many times Mysts budget. After the release of Riven, Robyn Miller left the company to pursue other projects, while Rand stayed behind {{to work on a}} Myst franchise.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> {{amount of energy}} required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce <b>the</b> <b>enormous</b> employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
