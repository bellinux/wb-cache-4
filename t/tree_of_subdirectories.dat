500|$|Plan 9 {{allows the}} user to collect the files (called names) from {{different}} directory trees in a single location. The resulting union directory behaves as the concatenation of the underlying directories (the order of concatenation can be controlled); if the constituent directories contain files having the same name, a listing of the union directory ( [...] or [...] ) will simply report duplicate names. Resolution of a single path name is performed top-down: if the directories [...] and [...] are unioned into [...] with [...] first, then [...] denotes [...] if it exists, [...] only if it exists and [...] does not exist, and no file if neither exists. No recursive unioning <b>of</b> <b>subdirectories</b> is performed, so if [...] exists, the files in [...] are not accessible through the union.|$|R

50|$|The {{use of a}} {{machine-readable}} format was {{to avoid}} the unnecessary overhead, in applications programs using systems such as the termcap library, of repeatedly parsing the database content to read the fields of a record. The use of multiple files was to avoid the similar overhead of parsing the database content to find the database record for the target terminal type. The terminal type name index is, effectively, the Unix/POSIX filesystem's ordinary directory structure. Originally, Unix had severe performance problems with large directories containing lots of files, and thus terminfo uses a two-level structure, dividing up the directory entries by first letter into a series <b>of</b> <b>subdirectories.</b> More recent filesystem formats used on Unix systems don't suffer as much from such problems (because their on-disc directory structures are no longer simple arrays of entries, but are organized into trees or hash tables) and so the necessity for this design element, that still exists in modern terminfo implementations, has since disappeared.|$|R
