25|$|In {{an effort}} to limit the {{potential}} harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as car phones and bag phones) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power. Modern handheld cellphones which must have the <b>transmission</b> <b>antenna</b> held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second <b>transmission</b> <b>antenna</b> system. One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the wide}} pattern of the <b>transmission</b> <b>antenna,</b> some of the signal always hit the ground, {{reflecting}} some of it back at the aircraft to cause a ground return. This was so powerful that it was received {{on all of the}} antennas, even the upper vertical receiver which would otherwise be hidden from signals below it. As the shortest distance, and thus the strongest signal, was received from reflections directly below the aircraft, this caused a strong blip to appear across all the displays at the range of the fighter's altitude. The ground further in front of the aircraft also caused returns, but these were increasingly distant (see slant range) and only some of the signal was reflected back at the aircraft while an increasing portion was scattered forward and away. Ground returns at further distances were thus smaller, resulting in a roughly triangular series of lines at the top or right side of the displays, known as the [...] "Christmas tree effect", beyond which {{it was not possible to}} see targets.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, {{transmit}} diversity {{has been proposed}} in various forms for many different communication systems. In this paper, we shall investigate, in particular the use of space-time {{transmit diversity}} (STTD) for coded OFDM systems using space-time block coding (STBC). With such an approach the STBC receiver must use one or more adjacent pilots to obtain orthogonal channel estimates from the different <b>transmission</b> <b>antennas.</b> To improve performance therefore, we propose to use pilot patterns for the separate <b>transmission</b> <b>antennas,</b> which are orthogonal in both the frequency and time directions. In this way, STBC {{can be used for}} a wide range of different conditions, since the receiver can either use adjacent pilots in the frequency or time direction depending upon the channel. 1...|$|R

40|$|For MIMO Rayleigh channels, it {{has been}} shown that {{transmitter}} correlations always degrade the performance of general space-time codes (STCs) in high SNR regimes. In this correspondence, however, we show that when MIMO channels experience single-keyhole conditions, the effect of spatial correlations between <b>transmission</b> <b>antennas</b> is more sophisticated for general STCs: when M>N (i. e., the number of <b>transmission</b> <b>antennas</b> is greater than the number of receiving antennas), depending on how the correlation matrix P beamforms the code word difference matrix Δ, the PEP performance of general STCs can be either degraded or improved in high SNR regimes. We provide a new measure, which is based on the eigenvalues of Δ and the numbers of <b>transmission</b> and receiving <b>antennas,</b> to exam if there exists certain correlation matrices that can improve the performance of general STCs in high SNR regimes.
