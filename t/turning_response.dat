Dorsal root ganglia from chick embryos were explanted onto a collagen-poly-L- lysine substrate. After 24 - 48 h in culture, NGF gradients were applied to individual growth cones via a micropipette containing 50 biological units NGF/ml. The growth cones turned and grew toward these NGF sources. This <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> was not caused by the trophic effects of NGF on neurite initiation, survival, or growth rate. Dorsal root neurites also grew toward sources of mono- and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dB cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and elevated calcium {{in the presence of}} the calcium ionophore A 23187. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intracellular levels of cAMP and /or cGMP and calcium may play a role in the <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> of dorsal root neurites toward NGF, but do not establish a causal relationship between the mechanisms of action of NGF, cyclic nucleotides and calcium.

Design: A cross sectional descriptive study. Setting: The Neonatal Unit of Hammersmith Hospital, London {{over a period}} of four months (February to May 1987) and the babies followed up for six months after discharge. Main Outcome Measures: Preterm babies of gestation 25 to 33 weeks confirmed by early postnatal Dubowitz assessment were studied. All infants had cranial ultrasound examination within the first 24 hours of birth. Protective side <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> was recorded for each baby weekly until discharge. The pattern of maturation of the response was then analysed. Results: Thirty preterm infants (mean gestation 30 weeks) were studied. The babies treated with theophylline had significant (p= 0. 004) delay in the maturation of the response. This improved within two weeks of stopping treatment. Eight infants had intracranial haemorrhage and seven had periventricular density. Both these groups were similar with respect to the maturation of the response. No significant interaction was found between theophylline therapy and abnormal cranial ultrasound as regards the protective side <b>turning</b> <b>response.</b> Six months follow up showed no serious neurological abnormalities among the infants.

40|$|AbstractCytoplasmic second messengers, Ca 2 + and cAMP, {{regulate}} nerve {{growth cone}} <b>turning</b> <b>responses</b> induced by many guidance cues, but the causal {{relationship between these}} signaling pathways has been unclear. We here report that, for growth cone turning induced by a gradient of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), cAMP acts by modulating MAG-induced Ca 2 + signaling. Growth cone repulsion induced by MAG was accompanied by localized Ca 2 + signals {{on the side of}} the growth cone facing the MAG source, due to Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. Elevating cAMP signaling activity or membrane depolarization enhanced MAG-induced Ca 2 + signals and converted growth cone repulsion to attraction. Directly imposing high- or low-amplitude Ca 2 + signals with an extracellular gradient of Ca 2 + ionophore was sufficient to trigger either attractive or repulsive turning, respectively.

40|$|Many {{cost-benefit}} decisions {{reduce to}} simple choices between approach or avoidance (or active disregard) to salient stimuli. Physiologically, critical factors in such decisions are modulators of the homeostatic neural networks that bias decision processes from moment to moment. For the predatory sea-slug Pleurobranchaea, serotonin (5 -HT) is an intrinsic modulatory promoter of general arousal and feeding. We correlated 5 -HT actions on appetitive state with {{its effects on}} the approach-avoidance decision in Pleurobranchaea. 5 -HT and its precursor 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) augmented general arousal state and reduced feeding thresholds in intact animals. Moreover, 5 -HT switched the <b>turn</b> <b>response</b> to chemosensory stimulation from avoidance to orienting in many animals. In isolated CNSs, bath application of 5 -HT both stimulated activity in the feeding motor network and switched the fictive <b>turn</b> <b>response</b> to unilateral sensory nerve stimulation from avoidance to orienting. Previously, it was shown that increasing excitation state of the feeding network reversibly switched the <b>turn</b> motor network <b>response</b> from avoidance to orienting, and that 5 -HT levels vary inversely with nutritional state. A simple model posits a critical role for 5 -HT {{in control of the}} <b>turn</b> network <b>response</b> by corollary output of the feeding network. In it, 5 -HT acts as an intrinsic neuromodulatory factor coupled to nutritional status and regulates approach-avoidance via the excitation state of the feeding network.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} behind {{the control of}} a typical two line kite, where the lines {{are attached to the}} kite side by side. This arrangement gives the kite flyer the ability to apply a roll angle to the kite, which then results in a yawing motion. The reason for this yaw rotation has not been adequately described previously. The definitions of roll and yaw for a kite have been re-defined to match the real world behaviour of the kite-bridle-line system. Specifically, these are defined as rotations relative to the lines rather than the kite itself. This detail has been neglected in previous research, and has a significant effect on the turning behaviour of a kite. A static model of a kite represented by flat disks was created. This model allows the out of balance forces and moments to be found for a kite when it is held at any position. When the kite is held with a roll angle applied, the disk angles of attack become unequal. This causes a change in the magnitude, direction, and point of action of the aerodynamic forces on each disk, which can lead to a yaw moment. While this does not give a complete picture of how a kite turns, it does explain one of the two mechanisms that cause a kite to begin to yaw when a roll angle is applied. The other mechanism is due to the velocity of the roll rotation, and is out of the scope of this thesis since a dynamic analysis would be required. The static model showed that any variation to kite geometry or any parameter that affects the equilibrium position of the kite will affect <b>turning</b> <b>response.</b> The most important of these parameters for a simple kite represented by two disks is the dihedral angle. A minimum negative dihedral angle (or anhedral) is required for a kite to turn in the expected direction when a roll angle is applied. The value of the minimum anhedral angle required for this behaviour varies with other parameters, but is generally between 8 ° and 20 °. Other parameters such as bridle geometry also affect the <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> of a kite, primarily because they alter the equilibrium positions of the kite and line. Altering these equilibrium positions has a strong effect on <b>turning</b> <b>response,</b> since it changes the initial disk angles of attack. Additionally, if the kite and line are not aligned perpendicular to each other (which is a rare condition for a kite) a roll angle further changes the disk angles of attack, since the roll angle is applied about an axis relative to the line rather than the kite. An investigation into the effect of varying wind velocity on <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> showed that it has an important effect. Some kites will reverse their response to a given roll angle at some wind velocities, which could make the kite very difficult to control. Additionally, some kites can alter their equilibrium positions sharply with wind velocity, again causing varying turning behaviour as the wind conditions change. Future work should examine the dynamic <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> of kites. A dynamic simulation could be used to examine how the <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> of a kite is influenced by the rate at which a control input is applied. Additionally, the behaviour of the kite once the initial turning movement has begun could be assessed...|$|E

However, whether filopodia also play an essential role in growth cone <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> induced by a diffusible chemotropic substance is unclear. Growth cones of cultured Xenopus spinal neurons exhibited chemotropic turning responses in a gradient of glutamate within a limited range of concentrations. This <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> depends on the activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors and requires the presence of extracellular Ca 2 +. Time-lapse differential interference contrast microscopy with quantitative analysis of filopodia dynamics showed a close correlation between an increased number of filopodia {{on the side of the}} growth cone facing the glutamate source and the turning. Such filopodia asymmetry was observed within minutes after the onset of the glutamate gradient, before any detectable turning of the growth cone. In Ca”-free medium, no filopodia asymmetry was induced by the glutamate gradient, and no growth cone turning was observed. Furthermore, elimination of filopodia with a low concentration of cytochalasin B completely abolished the <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> without substantially affecting neurite extension. Thus, filopodia may be required for chemotropic guidance of the growth cone, and an asymmetry in filopodia distribution may be an early cellular event responsible for determining the direction the growth cone advances.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanism}} by which growing neurites sense and respond to small applied electrical fields is not known, {{but there is some}} evidence that the entry of Ca 21 from the external medium, with the sub-sequent formation of intracellular Ca 21 gradients, is important in this process. We have employed two ap-proaches to test this idea. Xenopus spinal neurites were exposed to electrical fields in a culture medium in which Ca 21 was chelated to very low levels compared to the normal extracellular concentration of 2 mM. In other experiments, loading the neurites with the calcium buffer, 1, 2 -bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N*,N*-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA), disrupted the putative internal Ca 21 gradients, and the effects on the electrical response were determined. Fields of 100 mV/mm were applied for 12 h, and no difference was detected in the cathodal <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> between the treated neurites and the untreated controls. Using the Differential Growth Index (DGI), an asymmetry index, to quantitate the <b>turning</b> <b>response,</b> we recorded DGIs of 20. 64, 20. 65, and 20. 62 for control cells, cells in Ca 21 -free medium, and cells preloaded with BAPTA, respectively. Furthermore, we detected an increase in neurite length for those neurons cultured in Ca 21 -free medium; they were 1. 5 – 1. 7 times as long as neurites from neurons cultured in normal Ca 21 medium. Likewise, we found that BAPTA-loaded neurites were longer than control neurites. Our data indicate that neuronal galvanotropism is independent of the entry of external Ca 21 or of internal Ca 21 gradients.

Their sinusoidal pattern of movement is highly stereotypic {{and serves as a}} tool to monitor defects in neurons and muscles that control movement. Until recently, a simple yet robust method to initiate movement response on-demand did not exist. We have found that the electrical stimulation in a microfluidic channel, using constant DC electric field, induces movement (termed electrotaxis) that is instantaneous, precise, sensitive, and fully penetrant. We have further characterized this behaviour and, in this paper, demonstrate that electrotaxis can also be induced using a pulse DC electric signal. Worms responded to pulse DC signals with as low as 30 % duty cycle by moving towards the negative electrode at the same speed as constant DC fields (average speed of C. elegans[*]=[*] 296 [*]±[*] 43 [*]μm/s and C. briggsae[*]=[*] 356 [*]±[*] 20 [*]μm/s, for both constant and pulse DC electric fields with various frequencies).

We also investigated the <b>turning</b> <b>response</b> of worms to a change in the direction of constant and pulse DC signals.

For the game-like task to be successful, a high number of responses (in particular correct head <b>turn</b> <b>responses)</b> was required. Previous studies, although not all looking at localisation ability, have used many different techniques to obtain the maximum number of responses from a child. The children were engaged inside a custom-built environment inside an anechoic chamber. Three large video screens onto which backgrounds and animated characters were projected and manipulated and used to engage the child in the game-like task. Behind the video screens were loudspeakers from which the auditory stimulus where presented. A correct response to the auditory stimulus i. e. a head, hand or eye movement towards the target speaker was rewarded with a animated character presented on the screens (incorrect responses were presented with a static character). The location of the reward in relation to the auditory stimulus was a point of interest and was investigated to see how it affected the number of responses. The method shows it was possible to engage the child with the visual environment and obtain responses, however, the results showed generally fewer head <b>turn</b> <b>responses</b> than expected, especially in the younger age groups. Motion tracking technology was used to measure the localisation ability of the children, as well as measuring the responses, the motion tracking data was used and programs developed which could automatically classify the responses the children made to the sounds. The thesis has shown {{that it is possible to}} devise a new method which can be used to engage the child in the task and extract and classify their responses to auditory stimuli in order to measure their localisation ability...|$|R
