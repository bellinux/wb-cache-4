They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> <b>of</b> Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed.
