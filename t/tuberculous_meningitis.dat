40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Tuberculous</b> (TB) <b>meningitis</b> is {{sometimes}} difficult to diagnose in young children. The decision to start anti-TB treatment of TB meningitis is usually made on clinical grounds and results of special investigations, such as cerebrospinal fluid examination and cranial computerized tomography (CT), because bacteriologic yield {{is low and}} the results delayed. AIM: To determine whether the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic criteria used in the diagnosis of TB meningitis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -uninfected children apply to HIV-infected children. METHODS: Retrospective, case-control study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of TB meningitis were compared in 34 HIV-infected and 56 HIV-uninfected patients matched for age and stage of TB meningitis. RESULTS: All clinical differences found between the 2 groups at admission {{were related to the}} underlying HIV disease. Neurologic presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings at admission did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Significantly more HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected children had evidence of TB on chest radiography. The classic CT signs of TB meningitis (obstructive hydrocephalus and basal enhancement) were significantly less prominent in the HIV-infected group (P < 005). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis of TB meningitis apply to HIV-infected children. However, cranial CT findings in this group may be misleading and delay the diagnosis of TB meningitis. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Children with {{tuberculosis}} {{present with}} {{high rates of}} disseminated disease and <b>tuberculous</b> (TB) <b>meningitis</b> due to poor cell-mediated immunity. Recommended isoniazid doses vary from 5 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day.

The AUC 0 - 24 /MIC ratio associated with 80 % of maximal kill (80 % effective concentration [EC 80]), considered the optimal effect, is 287. 2. Given the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid encountered in children 10 years old or younger, with infants as a special group, and given the differences in penetration of isoniazid into phagocytic cells, epithelial lining fluid, and subarachnoid space during TB meningitis, we performed 10, 000 patient Monte Carlo simulations to determine how well isoniazid doses of between 2. 5 and 40 mg/kg/day would achieve or exceed the EC 80. None of the doses examined achieved the EC 80 in ≥ 90 % of children. Doses of 5 mg/kg were universally inferior; doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day were adequate only under the very limited circumstances of children who were slow acetylators and had disease limited to pneumonia. Each of the three disease syndromes, acetylation phenotype, and being an infant required different doses to achieve adequate AUC 0 - 24 /MIC exposures in an acceptable proportion of children. We conclude that current recommended doses for children are likely suboptimal and that isoniazid doses in children are best individualized based on disease process, age, and acetylation status...|$|R

All the patients were subjected to a detailed neurological evaluation. The outcome was defined 6 months after starting treatment {{on the basis of the}} Barthel index (BI) score into poor (BI < 12) and good recovery (BI⩾ 12). Death was included in the poor recovery group for statistical analysis. Thirteen clinical (age, sex, seizure, focal weakness, stage of meningitis, Glasgow coma scale score, methyl prednisolone therapy), CT (infarction, hydrocephalus, tuberculoma) and neurophysiological (EEG, motor and somatosensory evoked potentials) variables were evaluated employing single variable logistic regression followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The best set of predictors were obtained by stepdown logistic regression analysis.  RESULTS—Fifty four patients were included in the present study. Their age ranged between 5 and 62 years, 11 were children younger than 12 years and 14 were female. Nine patients were in stage I meningitis, 12 in stage II, and 33 in stage III. On single variable logistic regression analysis the significant predictors of 6 months outcome of TB meningitis included focal weakness, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), motor evoked potential (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). On multivariable analysis the best set of predictors comprised focal weakness, GCS, and SEP.  CONCLUSIONS—In patients with TB meningitis focal weakness, GCS, and SEP are the best predictors of 6 month outcome. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacteriological {{confirmation}} of <b>tuberculous</b> (TB) <b>meningitis</b> is difficult. Culture {{is slow and}} microscopy has insufficient sensitivity. We evaluated real time PCR targeting insertion sequence IS 6110 among 230 consecutive adult patients with subacute meningitis in a referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were examined using microscopy, solid and liquid culture, and real time IS 6110 -PCR with a fluorescence-labeled probe using DNA extracted from CSF. CSF samples from 40 non-infectious neurology patients were used as negative controls. IS 6110 -PCR results were linked with clinical and CSF characteristics. RESULTS: Most patients presented with subacute meningitis, after a median of 14 days of symptoms (range 7 - 30). After exclusion of cryptococcal and bacterial meningitis, 207 patients were classified as definite or probable TB meningitis; 17. 9 % with HIV infection. Among this group IS 6110 -PCR gave the highest positivity rate (68 %, 95 % CI 62 - 74 %) compared with microscopy of ZN-stained slides (11 %, 95 % CI 7 - 15 %), and mycobacterial culture using solid (36 %, 95 % CI 29 - 42 %) and liquid (44 %, 95 % CI 37 - 51 %) media. IS 6110 -PCR was positive in 92 % of patients with culture-positive and 42 % of patients with culture-negative probable TB meningitis. Among culture-negative patients, a positive PCR {{was associated with a}} history of TB treatment, a longer duration of illness, a higher CSF cell count and protein, and a lower CSF glucose. IS 6110 -PCR was negative in all CSF samples from non-meningitis control patients.

MethodsWe reviewed the patients with these features and tuberculosis confirmation by culture and/or histologic granuloma with presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). ResultsWe found 16 patients with the following locations: eight in oral cavity and/or pharynx, four in ear, two in salivary glands, one in nose and one in frontal sinuses. The average duration of symptoms was 11. 5 months. Purified protein derivative (PPD) was positive (> 10 mm) {{in all but one}} patient in whom it was performed (six of seven). Except tuberculous otitis, which occured without reactive lymphadenitis, this was present in 50 % of the rest (six of the 12). In all cases a biopsy was required for diagnosis.

Glucose has long been routinely measured in most spinal fluids submitted for laboratory examination. Increased lactate concentrations in CSF from similar pa-tients were first noted in 1924 (2). However, in contrast to glucose, and undoubtedly related {{to the complexity of}} its determination, only recently has lactate been commonly used as an early indicator of bacterial meningitis and as a differ-ential aid in distinguishing this entity from aseptic meningitis (3 - 6). Lactate dehydrogenase (LD, EC 1. 1. 1. 27) was first mea-sured in CSF in 1957 (7).

40|$|Due to the HIV pandemic, the {{spectrum}} of causative agents of meningitis has changed in favor of opportunistic organisms. Sub-Sahara Africa is mostly affected and mortality from meningitis is higher compared to Western countries. The diagnosis of meningitis is often difficult, especially in a resource poor setting. In this study we focussed on epidemiology, clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of severe meningitis in southern Rwanda. In addition we developed a diagnostic algorithm that allows a fast diagnosis and therapy in a resource poor setting. Therefore, we analyzed the data of 267 patients retrospectively, that were admitted to University Hospital of Butare (CHUB) in Rwanda. The data of 203 patients were evaluable.

40|$|BACKGROUND Infectious disease {{remains a}} major cause of death and {{disability}} for millions around the world, in spite of progress in many antibiotics and preventive strategies. Even though, CNS is protected by blood brain barrier, a system of tight junction around capillaries fail to resist the entry of microorganisms at times. Its presence, prevents the achievement of sufficient concentration of antibiotics in CSF. CNS infections can cause devastating sequelae, and in some cases, it can present as neurological or medical emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS CSF samples were obtained from 50 patients of clinically suspected cases of meningitis who are admitted in Medicine Department of Government General Hospital, Kakinada, during the period from October 2013 and September 2016. A sample size of 50 patient were included in the study. RESULTS CRP levels were elevated in pyogenic meningitis. The mean CRP level in our study was 30. 2 ± 5. 22 mg/dL. The patients with <b>tuberculous</b> and viral <b>meningitis</b> had a mean CRP level of 2. 37 ± 4. 79 mg/dL and 1. 17 ± 0. 31 mg/dL, respectively. In our study, we had high values of ADA in TBM with a mean of 14. 17 ± 11. 2 U/L. In pyogenic meningitis, it was 3. 4 ± 3. 03 U/L, and in viral meningitis, it was 1. 96 ± 0. 99 U/L. Higher cutoff values for ADA helped in separating the overlapped cases of pyogenic and TBM. CONCLUSION As in previous studies, it is apparent from the results of our study that the level of ADA in CSF was considerably elevated in TBM compared with viral meningitis. This conclusion has proved to be extremely beneficial in the treatment of viral meningitis where patients have been started inadvertently on prolonged courses of antitubercular medication with the misdiagnosis of tubercular meningitis. We found that the ADA levels correlated with the severity of clinical presentation. Patients who presented with altered sensorium, cranial nerve involvement and hemiparesis were noted to have higher ADA values. However, there was no clear correlation with the outcome. One fatal case of tubercular meningitis had an ADA of 52 U/L (although, few patients with a mild elevation above the cut-off value have also died) ...|$|R
