5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret <b>these</b> <b>verses</b> to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret <b>these</b> <b>verses</b> to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} to St. Peter's sister {{may be a}} substitution for St. Peter's daughter, St. Petronilla, known in England as St. Parnell. It {{has been suggested that}} the differing colours associated with <b>these</b> <b>verses</b> may have been determined by the colour of prayer beads, with different coloured beads used to prompt the recitation of aves and paternosters.|$|E
5|$|The above {{passage from}} Mahabharata emphasises the {{cardinal}} importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa {{is the highest}} virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase Ahimsa Paramo Dharma are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. <b>These</b> <b>verses</b> develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, {{there is no consensus}} on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.|$|E

50|$|The Old English Boethius is an Old English translation/adaptation of the sixth-century Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, {{dating from}} between c. 880 and 950.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>these</b> <b>verse</b> translations is {{the addition of}} adjectives. For example, the adjective “freshly” arguably changes the whole imagery of this section, {{from that of a}} firmly rooted, strong being of nature, to a weak and flexible sapling. Another interpretation of this, is that Sidney’s tree represents a new “fresh” faith that still has room to grow with the aid of god’s “sweet springs”.|$|R
