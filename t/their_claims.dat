5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet claims were out of the agenda by 1947.

5|$|Much {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, {{how fast the}} punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary <b>their</b> <b>claims</b> were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like quantum evolution, saltationism, and mass extinction.|$|E

McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Seven Years' War, {{attacks were}} {{launched}} on Sweden from Danish Halland in 1563, and Swedish counterattacks were launched against Danish provinces of Halland and Skåne in 1565 and 1569.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium were made from laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Although the Swedish scientists soon retracted <b>their</b> <b>claims,</b> the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) credited the Soviet team with the discovery, but retained nobelium, the Swedish proposal, as the name of the element due to its long-standing use in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Peace was {{restored}} with {{the mediation of}} Henry I of Jerusalem, who persuaded both Leo and Bohemond to renounce <b>their</b> <b>claims</b> to suzerainty over each other.

Raymond died in early 1197, but his widow {{give birth to a}} posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen.

Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years.
