5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute {{when he was}} first to reach the loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt as he left the field and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E

Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the clash}} of the two top teams of Division Two of the Championship, Durham came the closest to losing a game {{so far in the}} season – though they <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> themselves. With England {{requiring}} Steve Harmison to be rested, the team at last looked beatable, though they had Yorkshire on the rack at 124 for 7 and 179 for 9. However, Richard Dawson and Deon Kruis let loose for Yorkshire, scoring 75 for the last wicket in a late blitz to guide Yorkshire to a total of 254.|$|E

25|$|According to The Clan Ranald Bard, on 3 April 1746, the Royal Navy ship Baltimore arrived, {{and demanded}} (under threat of force) {{to be given}} the meat from the best cattle on the Island; 4 days later, {{complaining}} that the meat was rotten, the sailors <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> and slaughtered 60 cattle themselves. The Bard {{goes on to say that}} 12 days later, the Royal Navy ship Commodore arrived, and after receiving warning (from one of the sailors) about the lecherous intentions of the sailors, the women of Canna fled into the countryside and caves, until they were certain that the ship had departed; one pregnant woman miscarried from spending so long in the cold, and died.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 2004, the Maple Leafs {{were playing}} {{a game against the}} Nashville Predators, when Leaf captain Mats Sundin's stick broke on an {{attempted}} shot at the blue line and he <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> in disgust. Instead of hitting the glass, the stick accidentally went over and into the crowd. The NHL reacted by giving him a one-game suspension. The game he was suspended for was a game against the Senators in Toronto. During the game, Daniel Alfredsson's stick broke, and he immediately faked a toss of his stick into the stands. This caused an uproar with the Maple Leafs, in part because they had also lost the game 7–1. Alfredsson dismissed the Leafs' reaction, calling it an over-reaction. This incident added to the rivalry, and Leafs fans continue to boo Alfredsson at future games.|$|E
25|$|After the attack, Lucheni fled {{down the}} Rue des Alpes, where {{he threw the}} file into the {{entrance}} to No. 3. He was caught by two cabdrivers and a sailor, then secured by a gendarme. The weapon was found the next day by the concierge during his morning cleaning; he thought it belonged to a laborer who had moved {{the day before and}} did not notify the police of his discovery until the following day. There was no blood on the file and the tip was broken off, which occurred when Lucheni <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> The file was so dull in appearance it was speculated that it had been deliberately selected because it would be less noticeable than a shiny knife, which would have given Lucheni away as he approached. Lucheni had planned to purchase a stiletto, but lacking the price of 12 francs he had simply sharpened an old file into a homemade dagger and cut down a piece of firewood into a handle.|$|E

And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan that he had to make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E

Our approach seems to have gone a bit wrong and we've lost our scoring touch where {{earlier in the season}} our finishing was great." ...|$|E

When handed the notepad, Allinson read the poem and was so moved he immediately committed it to memory. He described it as being [...] "almost an exact description of the scene in front of us both". According to legend, McCrae was not satisfied with his work.

When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

500|$|After the race, Simpson {{prepared}} for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the [...] road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He {{got back to the}} peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia.

500|$|Federal troops {{combed the}} rural area's woods and swamps for Booth {{in the days}} {{following}} the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an [...] "unspeakable calamity" [...] for African Americans. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an [...] "accursed devil," [...] "monster," [...] "madman," [...] and a [...] "wretched fiend." [...] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: [...] "Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some <b>threw</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> some burned it, some crumpled it angrily." [...] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act [...] "a disgrace to the age". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.|$|E

2500|$|After {{dropping}} the first game, the Mets turned to young phenom Dwight Gooden in what figured to be a classic matchup with Boston's own young pitching sensation Roger Clemens.

All three were popular athletes. Klebold tried to pull Shoels {{out from under the}} table. He called to Harris, referring to him by his online identity and shouting, [...] "REB! There's a nigger over here!" [...] Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, Klebold and Harris taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; [...] "Who's ready to die next?". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death.
