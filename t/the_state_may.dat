5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>may</b> involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|If I were in {{possession}} of any public documents calculated to advance the public interest, it would give me pleasure to furnish them, and I shall at all times be prepared to afford you any information which the constitution or laws of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> require....

5|$|Social {{equality}} and {{equal access to}} public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no person shall be discriminated {{on the basis of}} religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats and temples etc. However, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> make any special provision for women and children.

5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. <b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E

25|$|Governments {{may choose}} to give {{subsidies}} to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer externalities than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>may</b> simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company– with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>may</b> choose to provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or public service obligation tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the lowest bidder. Total EU rail subsidies amounted to €73 billion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} not {{intended}} to be entirely negative, with States able to highlight in their reports progress which has been made examples of good practices.
