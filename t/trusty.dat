5|$|Western gunslinger {{heroes are}} portrayed as local lawmen or {{enforcement}} officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with <b>trusty</b> sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering {{from place to place}} with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).|$|E

Upgraded from recurring to contract status, Hendrickson became {{an integral part of the}} cast.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title <b>Trusty</b> and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} {{contract}} net protocol in order to compare various delegation strategies. We have implemented some different agents, having a set of tasks to delegate (or to perform by themselves); the tasks are performed by the agents in a dynamic environment, that can help or worse their activity. The agent rely upon different strategies in order to choose whom to delegate. We implemented three classes of trustiers: a random <b>trustier</b> (who randomly chooses the trustee whom delegate the task to); a statistical <b>trustier</b> (who builds the trustworthiness of other agents only {{on the basis of}} their previous performances); a cognitive <b>trustier</b> (who builds a sophisticated and cognitively motivated trust model of the trustee, taking into account its specific features, its ability and motivational disposition, and the impact of the environment on its performance). Our experiments show the advantage of using cognitive representations. ...|$|R

5000|$|Parchman Farm, as {{the prison}} was {{originally}} called, {{was built in}} 1903 on the rich soil of the Mississippi Delta. By Mississippi law, the prison was required to pay for itself and even make a profit for the state. This essentially meant the State was entering into business, using no-cost labor. This was harmful to normal businesses, which had to bear the normal cost of labor. The prison warden was in complete control of the prison, without outside interference. Its operations essentially remained much the same from 1903 until the Gates v. Collier Prison Reform Case (1970-1971) forced it to change. In 1911, the New York Times wrote an article praising the Mississippi prison system for its for-profit approach to incarceration.The prison had approximately 16000 acre of farmland and grew such cash crops as cotton as well as engaged in livestock production. Although {{the population of the}} prison was around 1,900 inmates (two thirds of whom were black and in segregated units), by law only a maximum of 150 staff members were allowed to be hired to minimize operating costs. Thus the farm labor was done by inmates. The bulk of guarding and disciplining of the inmates was performed by inmate <b>trusties.</b> They also performed most of the administrative work, supervised by a few employees. Therefore, the inmate <b>trusties</b> essentially controlled inmate care and custody. Essentially, the <b>trusties</b> ran the prison system. Highest in the prison inmate hierarchy were the inmates armed with rifles, called the [...] "trusty shooters". Their job was to act as prison guards and control other inmates on a day-to-day basis in the residential camps or out on the field work crews. Next came the unarmed <b>trusties</b> who performed janitorial, [...] and other menial tasks for the prison's staff. Simple tasks, such as distributing medication, were carried out by other categories of inmates such as [...] "hallboys". Inmate <b>trusties</b> enforced discipline within the prison inmate living quarters (16 different residential camps) and in the work camps and farms. In addition to punishment administered on site, inmate <b>trusties</b> could recommend further punishment in the special punishment area for disobedient or disruptive inmates.|$|R
