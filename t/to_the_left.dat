The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house.|$|E

40|$|Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit {{representational}} neglect: {{a failure}} to report details from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of mentally visualized images. This failure could reflect impaired ability <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of <b>the</b> mental image, or it could reflect failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of a normally generated mental image. When subjects with hemispatial neglect look at pictures or drawings, their attention tends to be drawn <b>to</b> objects on <b>the</b> right side, thereby aggravating their failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side. If representational neglect represents a failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of a normally generated mental visual image, then it should be improved by blindfolding, which removes the attention-catching right-sided stimuli.

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the north wall window. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To {{the right side of the}} altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Background: Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit {{representational}} neglect: {{a failure}} to report details from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of mentally visualized images. This failure could reflect impaired ability <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of <b>the</b> mental image, or it could reflect failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of a normally generated mental image. When subjects with hemispatial neglect look at pictures or drawings, their attention tends to be drawn <b>to</b> objects on <b>the</b> right side, thereby aggravating their failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side. If representational neglect represents a failure <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of a normally generated mental visual image, then it should be improved by blindfolding, which removes the attention-catching right-sided stimuli. However, if representational neglect represents a failure <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of <b>the</b> mental visual image, then blindfolding should have little impact on reporting of details of <b>the</b> image. Methods: <b>To</b> determine which of these explanations is correct, we asked eight normal participants and eight brain-damaged patients with left representational neglect <b>to</b> imagine <b>the</b> map of France and to name as many towns as possible in 2 minutes. In different sessions, participants performed the task with eyes open or while blindfolded. Results: Normal participants mentioned more towns while blindfolded than with vision, thus suggesting a distracting effect of visual details on mental imagery. Patients with neglect, however, showed no appreciable effect of blindfolding on reporting of details from either side of mental images. Conclusion: Representational neglect may represent a failure <b>to</b> generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side of mental images...|$|R

In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> is the half cell and to the right the cell.
