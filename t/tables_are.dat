50|$|A <b>table</b> <b>is</b> a {{homogeneous}} collection of records, where each record {{has the same}} set of columns. Each <b>table</b> <b>is</b> identified by a table name, whose scope is local to the database in which the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> contained. The amount of disk space allocated to a table within a database is determined by a parameter given when the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> created with the CreateTable operation. Tables grow automatically in response to data creation.|$|R
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> tabulated data, {{often in}} the form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas.|$|E

5|$|In a {{significant}} departure from conventional practice, the <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> {{not based on}} a bottom time defined as time of leaving the surface to time leaving the bottom, but on time to reach a depth of 6m during the ascent.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian {{saturation}} decompression <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> similar, but specifically do {{not allow}} decompression to start with an upward excursion. Partial pressure of oxygen is maintained between 0.4 and 0.5 bar, and a rest stop of 6 hours is specified each night starting at midnight.|$|E
5|$|These values can be {{used with}} {{standard}} open circuit decompression tables, but are not applicable with constant oxygen partial pressure as provided by closed circuit rebreathers. <b>Tables</b> <b>are</b> used with the sea level equivalent depth and stops are done at the altitude stop depth.|$|E

5|$|Four bronze <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> located outside The Exchange on Corn Street, {{probably}} modelled after mobile tables {{which were}} taken to trade fairs and markets. Before the Corn Exchange {{was built in the}} 18th century, the tables—called nails—were located in the Tolzey Walk. This covered area was along the south wall of All Saints Church, which remains as a narrow lane giving access to commercial premises.|$|E
5|$|On their arrival, Southern, Dempsey and Kenyon use a ray gun {{to neutralise}} the store's robot guards and bypass the {{security}} doors {{one after the}} other, ultimately arriving in the plutonium vault. Southern reveals his true identity and holds the others at gunpoint, commanding them to proceed to the Leader's proposed rendezvous point and capture him. The <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> turned, however, when a robot traps Southern in a crushing grip. Dempsey and Kenyon unlock the bracelets and make a getaway, jamming the security doors and leaving Southern {{to die in the}} nuclear explosion.|$|E
5|$|Residual {{inert gas}} can be {{computed}} for all modeled tissues, but repetitive group designations in decompression <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> generally based on only the one tissue, {{considered by the}} table designers {{to be the most}} limiting tissue for likely applications. In the case of the US Navy Air Tables (1956) this is the 120 minute tissue, while the Bühlmann tables use the 80 minute tissue.|$|E

5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{fragments of}} the building— the wash-basin and two memorial tables from the forecourt, {{as well as some}} parts of a column— were saved by Ivo Kraus.

5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|To a {{large extent}} {{commercial}} offshore diving uses heliox tables {{that have been developed}} by the major commercial diving enterprises such as Comex, Oceaneering International (OI) Alpha tables, American Oilfield Diving (AOD) Company gas tables, though modifications of the US Navy Partial pressure <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> also used. In 2006 the unmodified US Navy tables (Revision 5) were considered to result in an unacceptably high rate of decompression sickness for commercial applications.|$|E

5000|$|It {{can now be}} {{made clear}} why the payment for an {{insertion}} is 3. 1 pays for the first insertion of the element, 1 pays for moving the element {{the next time the}} <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded, and 1 pays for moving an older element the next time the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded. Intuitively, this explains why an element's contribution never [...] "runs out" [...] regardless of how many times the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded: since the <b>table</b> <b>is</b> always doubled, the newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half.|$|R
5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> tabulated data, {{often in}} the form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two <b>tables</b> <b>are</b> initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E
