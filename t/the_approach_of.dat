5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, Union cavalry in the {{division}} of Brig. Gen.

5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared unaware of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, {{and forced to}} withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a tenth planet.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a line of thunderstorms could indicate <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

It would be interesting to compare the {{performance of the}} TALA to that of existing methods developed for specific applications, most notably <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> [2, 10, 19, 20] developed for multi-target localisation using TOA measurements and <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>of</b> [4, 5, 11, 12]) developed in order to localise a single emitter using hybrid AOA/TDOA measurements.|$|R

5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply.

By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were {{initially}} at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
5|$|Based at RAF Abbotsinch near Paisley, the {{squadron}} operated the Hawker Hind light bomber. The members of squadron—both pilots and ground staff—were reservists and completed their service on a part-time basis, in the evenings, weekends {{and an annual}} two–week summer camp. With <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> war, {{the squadron}} converted to a fighter role and re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire.

5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected.

The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February15 despite losing a building.

On February23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands.

5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area.

On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E
