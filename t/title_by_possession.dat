After carefully going into the facts, however, Soames had seen his way to advise that his client had what was known as a <b>title</b> <b>by</b> <b>possession,</b> and that, though undoubtedly the ground did not belong to him, he was entitled to keep it, and had better do so; and he was now following up this advice by taking steps to--as the sailors say--'make it so.' ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the doctrine of <b>title</b> <b>by</b> <b>possession</b> and the doctrine of relative title. Many property lawyers believe that these doctrines are elementary, important and interesting. But, while virtually everyone accepts that possession of land or chattels is a source of title and that titles are relative, the doctrines have long been a focus of debate. The nature of possession, the nature of the possessorâs title, and the relationships between possession, relative title and ownership have been particularly contentious. Accordingly, this thesis seeks to provide sound answers to the following questions: (1) what, in this context, is possession? (2) What {{is the nature of the}} title that is acquired by taking possession of land or chattels? (3) Does English law recognise landownership and chattel-ownership?âand, if it does, is a person who acquires, by virtue of his or her possession, a title to land or chattels the (or an) owner of the land or chattels? It is argued in Chapter 2 that, for the purposes of the doctrine of <b>title</b> <b>by</b> <b>possession,</b> the general rule is that a person is in possession of land or chattels if and only if she has: (i) a sufficient degree of exclusive physical control; and (ii) an intention to possess. Chapters 3 â 5 are concerned with the second question. It is argued that, upon obtaining possession, a person acquires, in cases involving land, an estate in fee simple absolute in possession and, in cases involving chattels, a general property interest. Chapter 6 {{is concerned with}} the third question. It is argued that English law does recognise landownership and chattel-ownership; and that a person who acquires a title by obtaining possession of land or chattels owns the land or chattels if her title is supreme but not if it is inferior. </p...|$|E

50|$|Adverse {{possession}} is {{a situation}} when a person {{who does not have}} legal title to land (or real property) occupies the land without the permission of the legal owner. The permission of the owner may be reflected in the entering into a lease or granting a licence, typically associated with the payment of some rent. The laws of many countries allow the adverse possessor (in law also called the disseisor) to acquire title to the land after a prescribed statutory period, which varies between jurisdictions, and depends on the type of land and other circumstances. The laws of most jurisdictions do not permit claims of adverse possession against public land. Squatting is a form of adverse possession. The adverse possessor is usually required to prove non-permissive use which is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period. If a claim to <b>title</b> <b>by</b> adverse <b>possession</b> is successful, title is acquired without compensation.|$|R
50|$|At common law, {{ownership}} was proven via {{an unbroken}} {{chain of title}} deeds. The Torrens title system is an alternative way of proving ownership. First introduced in South Australia in 1858 by Sir Robert Torrens and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens <b>title</b> is proven <b>by</b> <b>possession</b> of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. This system removes risks associated with unregistered deeds and fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transactions. It is much easier and cheaper to administer, lowering transaction costs. Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds - usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century - and these are {{often referred to as}} 'Old System' deeds.|$|R
40|$|Summary]: Each {{state and}} {{territory}} within Australia adopted the Torrens system of land title registration whereby a principal {{feature of the}} Torrens system {{is the notion of}} an indefeasible title affording protection to registrable interests by the act of a registered proprietor holding the land absolutely free from all encumbrances except those noted on the register. There are a number of exceptions, one of which is not usually recognised - the loss of legal title through an application for possessory <b>title</b> <b>by</b> adverse <b>possession.</b> Adverse possession can be legislated as either a whole parcel or a part-parcel application. Within all states in Australia problem survey areas exist where the accuracy of modern measurment techniques when applied over surveys completed pre-electronic distance measurement will raise the issue of reinstatement by mathematical solution versus occupation based upon earlier surveys. A problem survey can exist where mathematical solutions and occupation vary greatly. This paper examines the application of part-parcel adverse possession as a means to resolve problem survey areas where agreement between land owners {{is not likely to be}} achieved where land readjustment between adjoining owners is desirable to maintain an accurate cadastre...|$|R
5000|$|In common law, {{through the}} legally {{recognized}} concept of adverse possession, a squatter {{can become a}} bona fide owner of property without compensation to the former owner. Adverse possession is {{the process by which}} one acquires the title to a piece of land by occupying it for the number of years necessary, dictated differently in practice by each state's statute of limitation for an eviction action. A necessary component of this transfer of ownership requires that the landowner is aware (or should be aware) of the land occupation [...] and that he or she does nothing {{to put an end to}} it. If the land use by the new occupant goes unchecked for the said number of years, the new occupant can claim legal rights to the land. The occupant must show that the [...] "possession is actual, open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, under cover of claim or right, and continuous and uninterrupted for the statutory period." [...] As Erin Wiegand notes, the most difficult part of claiming adverse possession on the part of squatters is the [...] "continuous" [...] part. Squatting is a very transient lifestyle and many people are evicted on a frequent basis. In an article regarding recent foreclosures in the United States, a current squatter in Miami stated of her housing, [...] "It's a beautiful castle and it's temporary for me, if I can be here twenty-four hours, I'm thankful." [...] Thus, while adverse possession allows for the legality of a squatter's situation, it is not common that a person can claim continuous possession of the land long enough to claim <b>title</b> <b>by</b> adverse <b>possession.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Retired President Moi lost {{a part of}} his Kabarak University in a {{landmark}} court ruling. Mr Moi was ordered to surrender 100 acre to a neighbouring rancher, Mr Malcolm Bell. He was ordered by the Court of Appeal to surrender the farm within six months. This was a reversal of a High Court decision giving the land to Moi High School Kabarak, which is sponsored by the former president. The living quarters for Kabarak University lecturers and Kabarak High School teachers are located on part of the disputed farm. Part of the farm is also used for growing hay. The university and Moi High School Kabarak, which was developed during Mr Moi's 24 years in power, were some of his pet projects. If he did not comply with the orders, he could face eviction. Judgment was delivered in Nakuru by Lady Justice Martha Koome and Lady Justice Hannah Okwengu. Mr Justice Muga Apondi had allowed the school to continue occupying the land, saying that it had acquired a <b>title</b> deed <b>by</b> adverse <b>possession.</b> According to that system, if people occupy a piece of land for more than 12 years without the owner's permission, then they become the owner.|$|R
