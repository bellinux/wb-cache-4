40|$|The <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> of {{adenovirus}} {{are arranged}} in a T = 25 icosahedral surface lattice (Home et al., I 959; Caspar and Klug, 1962). Favorably oriented electron micrographs of this virus clearly show four six-coordinated units along an edge, separating the five-coordinated units at the vertices (Fig. 1). From this arrangement of <b>morphological</b> <b>units,</b> the triangulation umber is 25 (cf. Klug and Finch, 1965). The structure is complex since a total of nine different polypeptides {{have been found in}} the virus particle (Maizel et al., 1968 a). Two or three of these are core proteins and the rest may be associated with the icosahedral shell (Prage et al., 1970). The five-coordinated <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> on the surface have been called pentons (Ginsberg et al., 1966). These are made up of two parts, the penton base and the elongated penton fiber, each containing distinct polypeptides (Valentine and Pereira, 1965; Pettersson et al., I 968; Pettersson and HSglund, 1969; Maizel et al., 1968 a, b). The six-coordinated <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> on the surface have been called hexons (Ginsberg et al., 1966). The hexon polypeptide iffers from the polypeptides of the penton (Maizel et al., 1968 a, b; Pettersson et al., 1967; Pettersson and H 5 glund, 1969). The hexon, which is produced in 10 - to 100 -fold excess in infected cells, can be purified from cell extracts by ion-exchange chromatography followed by gel electrophoresis (Pettersson et al., 1967; Franklin et al., 1971).

In this paper, the sediment connectivity concept was tested at basin scale applying SEdiment Delivery Distributed model, which takes into account the hillslope sediment transport, and using sediment yield measurements carried out at SPA 2 experimental basin (Sicily, Italy). For the SPA 2 basin discretized into <b>morphological</b> <b>units,</b> the SEdiment Delivery Distributed model was first calibrated at event scale using the sediment yield measurements carried out at the outlet of the experimental basin in the period April 2000 -March 2015. The model calibration was used to determine the relationships useful for estimating the unique coefficient βe of the model appearing in the expression used to calculate the sediment delivery ratio of each <b>morphological</b> <b>unit.</b> The developed analysis allowed establishing that the functional connectivity is dependent on the magnitude of erosion events, and for low events the sediment connectivity is only governed by its structural component. Then, at annual scale, the model was calibrated for the period 2000 - 2015, and relationships for the estimate of the coefficient βa taking into account the intensity of erosion events occurring in each year were determined. Finally, a physical interpretation of β coefficient at the two temporal scales (βe, βa) and its link to sediment connectivity was proposed...|$|R

Virus particles tended to accumulate {{in large numbers}} in the nucleoplasm of the affected cells and had a distinct propensity to aggregate in crystalline formations. Individual particles ranged from 470 - 530 A, with an average diameter of 490 A. In negatively stained prepara-tions, virus particles averaged 560 A. The outer shell of the particles consisted of a close-packed array of <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> regularly disposed over the surface. Analysis of the conAguration of <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> revealed the following structural pattern: 1) The number of the units around {{the periphery of the}} particles was 15 - 16. 2) The total number of units resolved on one side of virus particles was estimated at 34 - 35. 3) The disposition of the neighboring 5 -coordinated units was characteristic of a skew class of surface structure.

40|$|Bedrock-controlled channel systems exhibit {{considerable}} morphological variation. Both bedrock-influenced and al- luvial <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> {{coexist to}} form a system of changing channel patterns in response {{to changes in the}} relative influence of the controlling process variables. This article investigates the morphological composition of the bedrock- influenced Sabie River, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, mapping 25 km of river channel at the scale of individual <b>morphological</b> <b>units.</b> Cluster and discriminant analyses define objective reach–scale “channel type” assemblages based on <b>morphological</b> <b>unit</b> composition. A number of robust clusters emerged that could be broadly classified into five channel types, namely, bedrock anastomosed, mixed anastomosed, pool-rapid, braided, and alluvial single-thread. The cluster analysis revealed that these channel types fit on a continuum from bedrock-dominated channels to fully alluvial systems. Each channel type could also be characterized by a certain set of “dominant” <b>morphological</b> <b>units,</b> which changed from bedrock-influenced {{at one end of the}} continuum (bedrock anastomosed, pool-rapid) to alluvial deposits at the other (braided, alluvial single-thread). An investigation of the role of controlling process variables in defining these channel types revealed a broad link between the degree of bedrock influence and the amount of available energy within the system as defined by indices such as the flow regime and water-surface slope variation. It is clear that the bedrock-dominated channel types are characterized by energy levels in excess of those accepted for alluvial systems, and an extended river classification is presented for the Sabie River that includes these bedrock channels. The mixed anastomosing channel type on the Sabie River is characterized by higher available energy levels than braided or alluvial single-thread reaches. As such, it appears to be a higher-energy example of an anabranched system, probably formed as a result of sediment accumulation on top of a high-energy bedrock anastomosed channel template...|$|R
50|$|Integrational Morphology, {{concerned}} with the analysis of phonological words (and other medial types of syntactic base forms) into meaningful parts, is largely analogous to Integrational Syntax. The morphological entities postulated for any idiolect system are <b>morphological</b> base forms, <b>units,</b> paradigms, categories, structures, and functions as well as lexemes. Morphological base forms (morphs) are entities of the same ontological type as syntactic base forms, structured phonological sound sequences {{in the case of}} a spoken idiolect; <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> are sequences of morphological base forms; and 'lexemes' are conceived as ordered pairs consisting of a morphological paradigm and a concept that is a meaning of the paradigm, similarly to the lexical words in syntax. For any syntactic base form there is a 'morphological analysis': a pair consisting of a <b>morphological</b> <b>unit</b> and a <b>morphological</b> structure of the <b>unit.</b> A <b>morphological</b> <b>unit</b> that is the first component in an analysis of a syntactic base form is a 'morphological word.' A morphological structure ofa <b>morphological</b> <b>unit</b> is a triple consisting of a morphological constituent structure, marking structure, and intonation structure. Two main types of morphological categories are assumed. Type 1 morphological categories (also called 'morphological unit categories'), given through the 'Morphological Unit Ordering' of an idiolect system, are sets of morphological units; they include morphological constituent categories, maximally, Stem form, Affix form, and Stem Group, as well as possible subcategories of Stem form and Affix form. Cross-linguistically, there must be stem forms in the idiolect systems of any language whereas the categories Affix form and Stem Group need not occur. Type 2 morphological categories ('lexeme categories') are sets of lexemes and are given through the 'Lexeme Ordering' of the idiolect system. They include the top-level lexeme categories Stem and Affix (comparable to the parts of speech in syntax) and their subcategories. Morphological functions (e.g., morphological complement, modifier, and nucleus) are comparable to grammatical functions in syntax in taking 'morphological quadruples' as their arguments and assigning relations among morphological constituents as values. They figure, via their semantic content, in morphosemantic meaning composition.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{views of}} {{morphology}} in Modern Standard Arabic hold that surface word forms comprise {{at least two}} morphemes: a three-consonantal root conveying semantic meaning and a word pattern carrying syntactic information. An alternative account claims that semantic information is carried by a bi-consonantal <b>morphological</b> <b>unit</b> called the etymon. Accordingly, in the form [batara] the core meaning is carried not by the tri-consonantal root morpheme {btr} but by the etymon morpheme {b,t} which surfaces in other forms like [batta] ªseverº, [batala] ªcut offº with the same meaning ªcuttingº. Previous experimental research in Semitic languages has assumed the tri-consonantal root/word pattern approach. In cross-modal and masked priming experiments we ask whether the etymon, as a more ®ne-grained two-conso-nantal <b>morphological</b> <b>unit,</b> can yield the morphological priming effects typically obtained with tri-consonantal root morphemes.

This study reenvisioned the classic velocity reversal by documenting stage-dependent changes to the locations of peak velocity without cross sections. Instead, the dynamics of peak velocity patches were considered for flows spanning 0. 2 to 22 times bankfull discharge {{through the use of}} a high-resolution DEM and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling. A remarkable diversity in peak velocity patch behaviour was found across discharges, including gradual expansion and shifting as well as abrupt disappearance and emergence relative to the low-flow patch locations.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a channel-forming, 'dominant' or 'bankfull' discharge has been applied, with some success, {{to a variety of}} alluvial river systems in temperate areas. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between flow magnitude and frequency, and the geomorphological units of the Sabie River in the Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The river is perennial, however, it exhibits an extreme seasonal flow regime. The river has been subject to incision (100, 000 - 10, 000 years ago), which exposed bedrock areas as topographic highs within a wide macro-channel. Zones of deposition have created alluvial sections resulting in a morphologically diverse river system. Stage-discharge relationships have been observed and constructed for 23 monitoring sites on the Sabie River. These have been used in conjunction with a 62 -year calibrated simulated daily discharge record, to generate inundation frequencies for the <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> present at each site. This includes results using annual maximum series data and time spans for activation, using the continuous daily flow data. The results reveal that the overall form of the cross-section is not related to a single channel-forming discharge, instead, a complex relationship exists whereby the section is influenced by the entire flow regime. The results do however suggest a poorly defined division of <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> within the incised macro-channel, namely, those influenced by perennial, seasonal and infrequent flows. This relationship is best demonstrated by the <b>morphological</b> <b>units</b> associated with the perennial, active channels in alluvial sections, which correlate with the low flow regime (1 - 2 -year return period on the annual maximum series), and larger macro-channel deposits which are related to rarer higher flows. Climatic wet and dry cycles, human influences and the physical effect of bedrock in the macro-channel further complicate the inundation pattern, resulting in disequilibrium conditions between channel form and contemporary flow regime on the Sabie River. Macro-channel sedimentary deposits, in particular, show no consistent relationship with a particular segment of the flow regime, being inundated by flows of between a 10 - and 50 -year return period...|$|R
