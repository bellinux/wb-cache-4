5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5000|$|An {{internal}} link {{is a type}} of hyperlink on a webpage to another page or resource, such as an image <b>or</b> document, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> website <b>or</b> domain. Hyperlinks are considered either [...] "external" [...] or [...] "internal" [...] depending on their target or destination.

5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> (<b>or</b> higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's version of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection {{similar to the one}} previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{issue is that}} whoever controls the TC infrastructure will acquire {{a huge amount of}} power.

5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for modifying the alphabet or the chart is to propose {{the change in}} the Journal of the IPA.

Reactions to the proposal may be published in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> subsequent issues of the Journal (as in August 2009 on the open central vowel). A formal proposal is then put to the Council of the IPA – which is elected by the membership – for further discussion and a formal vote.|$|E

Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had members in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> similar situation to Benn's (i.e., {{who were going}} to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of his}} election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>or</b> another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices.
