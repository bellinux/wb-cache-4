Unlike the men’s race, the women's continued in most years through the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's 30-game unbeaten streak {{during the}} 1920–21 season stood as a Football League record for 83 years {{until it was}} surpassed by Arsenal, who {{completed}} the entire season without losing in the 2003–04 campaign. After the defeat to Bradford City on 28 August 1920, Burnley did not lose another match at Turf Moor until 11 February 1922, when they were beaten 1–2 by Blackburn Rovers.

However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to it and they soon decide to sleep <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Sayid leaves to get {{a bottle of water}} for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the band}} {{released}} the cover album Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over {{the direction of}} the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup.

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1947–48 season, Harvey was {{called into the}} Victorian team for the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales and made his debut {{alongside}} Merv and Neil, who were already established players. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships as they were always out before the next sibling came in to bat. Ray came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Neil {{returned}} to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, and Ray was selected to make his first-class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 as Victoria ended with 331; the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory.

5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E
5|$|Neil and Merv {{retained}} {{their positions}} for Victoria’s first two matches of the 194748 season, against India and South Australia respectively. Again, Merv was out before Neil came in, {{so they did}} not bat together. The brotherly selection pairing was broken up for Victoria’s next match, as Neil was rewarded with selection for an Australian XI for a Test trial match against the Indians, while Merv continued to represent the state. Neil returned to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week, and Ray was selected to make his first-class debut, so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships. Merv opened and made 45 before being dismissed at 2/99, prompting Neil's entrance to replace him at the crease. Neil then top-scored with 61 before falling at 4/200, and Ray then came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on, and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> at first-class level.
