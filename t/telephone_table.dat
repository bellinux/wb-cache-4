50|$|The {{first major}} {{operation}} of the FA was the surveillance of Ernst Röhm. Ernst Röhm was the co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment), the Nazi Party's militia, and later was its commander. Röhm and his SA associates had been watched continuously {{since the end of}} 1933. Every telephone conversation, letter written, and every conversation that Röhm had uttered was reported to the FA. For many of the associates of Röhm, microphones had been placed in their private lodgings. These were concealed in their <b>telephones,</b> <b>table</b> lamps, chandeliers, electric clocks and other locations. The evidence collected was collated and evaluated in the evaluation centre of the FA. This evidence led directly to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in which 85-200 members of the SA and others were assassinated. During this action Schimpf was promoted to ministerial rank (Ministerialrat), which ensured for himself a position of great power.|$|R
60|$|The <b>telephone</b> on Brooks' <b>table</b> rang, and for {{a moment}} or two he found himself, with {{mechanical}} self-possession, attending to some unimportant question. When he replaced the receiver Lord Arranmore had resumed his seat, but was drawing on his gloves.|$|R
60|$|Madame Cerise had not slept much {{during the}} night. For {{an hour after}} Louise retired she sat in her room in deep thought. Then {{she went to the}} {{telephone}} and notwithstanding the late hour called up Diana, who had a branch <b>telephone</b> on a <b>table</b> at her bedside.|$|R
50|$|Phone Number Criteria - A {{company may}} set {{various levels of}} {{acceptance}} and rejection of telephone numbers found in long distance, local and fax calls. This feature, along {{with the ability to}} associate descriptions for these numbers using self-built or purchased <b>telephone</b> geographical <b>tables,</b> provides the ability to identify calls by the full number, area code and prefix, or area code alone, making it easier to identify the location called. The better ECRS will allow for custom input of business names at the exchange (XXX-XXX) and number levels (XXX-XXX-XXXX).|$|R

60|$|He started {{suddenly}} in his chair. An interruption ordinary enough, but never without a certain startling effect, had broken in upon his thoughts. The <b>telephone</b> on his <b>table</b> was ringing insistently. He {{rose to his}} feet and glanced at the clock as he crossed the room. It was five minutes past twelve. As he took up the receiver a familiar voice greeted him.|$|R
50|$|Sevagram ashram was the {{residence}} of Mahatma Gandhi from 1936 to 1948. After his 1930 Dandi salt march, Gandhi decided not {{to return to his}} ashram at Sabarmati. After spending two years in jail, he travelled around India and, at the invitation of the Gandhian industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj., stayed for some time in Wardha City at Jamnalal's bungalow. In 1936, at the age of 67, Gandhiji moved to a village (which he subsequently called Sewagram - Hindi for village of service) at the outskirts of Wardha and started to live here in a group of huts with his wife Kasturba and other disciples. This slowly grew into an ashram, where Gandhi lived with his followers for the next twelve years, till his death. The premises are very calming. Many personal items used by Gandhi and his contemporaries are preserved here including his spectacles, <b>telephone,</b> notebook, <b>tables,</b> mats, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} kind consist only of {{a ladder}} to a suitable height. Such trees could have platforms {{on the ground}} next to them for maps and a fire finder. A more elaborate version, such as the Gloucester tree in Australia added a permanent platform to the tree by building a wooden or, later, metal structure {{at the top of}} the tree and had metal spikes hammered into the trunk to form a spiral ladder. These 'platform trees' were often equipped with <b>telephones,</b> fire finder <b>tables,</b> seats and guy-wires.|$|R
5000|$|Ambani {{returned}} from Yemen to India and started [...] "Majin" [...] {{in partnership with}} Champaklal Damani, his second cousin, who lived with him in Turkey [...] Majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices to Yemen. The first office of the Reliance Commercial Corporation was set up at the Narsinatha Street in Masjid Bunder. It was a 350 sq ft room with a <b>telephone,</b> one <b>table</b> and three chairs. Initially, they had two assistants {{to help them with}} their business. During this period, Ambani and his family stayed in a two-bedroom apartment at the Jai Hind Estate in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai. In 1965, Champaklal Damani and Dhirubhai Ambani ended their partnership and Ambani started on his own. It is believed that both had different temperaments and a different take on how to conduct business. While Damani was a cautious trader and did not believe in building yarn inventories, Ambani was a known risk-taker and believed in building inventories to increase profit.|$|R
60|$|General Mitchener is at {{his writing}} table in the War Office, opening letters. On his left is the fireplace, with a fire burning. On his right, against the {{opposite}} wall is a standing desk with an office stool. The door is in the wall behind him, half way between {{the table and the}} desk. The table is not quite {{in the middle of the}} room: it is nearer to the hearthrug than to the desk. There is a chair at each end of it for persons having business with the general. There is a <b>telephone</b> on the <b>table.</b> Long silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] the Duke continued. [...] "Listen to me, Prince. This {{morning a}} London {{magistrate}} will grant {{what is called}} a search warrant which will enable the police to search, from attic to cellar, your house in St. James' Square. An Inspector from Scotland Yard will be there this afternoon awaiting your return, and he believes that he has witnesses who will be able to identify you as one who has broken the laws of this country. I ask you no questions. There is the <b>telephone</b> on the <b>table.</b> My eighty-horse-power Daimler is at the door and at your service. I understand that your cruiser in Southampton Harbor is always under steam. If there is anything more, in reason, that I can do, you have only to speak." [...] The Prince shook his head slowly.|$|R
5000|$|A lookout tree is {{a simple}} fire lookout created by {{attaching}} a ladder or a series of spikes to a tall straight tree {{with a view of}} the surrounding lands, allowing rangers or fire crews to conveniently climb the tree to survey their surroundings. The simplest kind consist only of a ladder to a suitable height: this kind was called a [...] "ladder tree." [...] Some ladder trees had platforms on the ground next to them for maps and a fire finder. A more elaborate version often created a platform on top of the tree trunk by cutting off approximately the last 10 ft of the treetop and building a railed wooden platform on the resulting stump. These [...] "platform trees" [...] were often equipped with <b>telephones,</b> fire finder <b>tables,</b> seats and guy wires. Accommodation for the watcher was provided by a tent or shelter at the bottom of the tree.|$|R
5000|$|An {{option on}} Crown coupes was the Mobile Director. Essentially the front {{passenger}} seat turned to face rearward and a small table and high intensity light folded out over the back seat. The idea was that an [...] "executive" [...] could turn around and do work while being driven to the office, or he could sit behind the driver and a secretary could take dictation in the rear-facing front seat. The concept originated with the 1966 Mobile Executive Show Car that was an Imperial Coupe fitted with a <b>telephone,</b> Dictaphone, writing <b>table,</b> typewriter, television, reading lamp and stereo. Chrysler also used the reversed front seat idea in the 300X show car. Costing $597.40 ($317.60 in 1968), at a time when a Crown coupe started at $6011, it was a very expensive option. Thus a total of only 81 Crown coupes were ordered this way, and only a handful so equipped are known to still exist. The option was cancelled {{at the end of the}} 1968 model year. Sales increased to 17,614.|$|R
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a <b>table,</b> <b>telephone,</b> two chairs, and a cigar.|$|R
500|$|The {{ships of}} the King George V class {{were some of}} the first battleships in the RN to receive the full suite of fire-control {{equipment}} used during the First World War. The control position for the main armament was located in the conning tower. Data from a [...] coincidence rangefinder (an unstabilized Barr and Stroud instrument in [...] and stabilized Argo units in the other ships) {{on the roof of the}} conning tower, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to a Dreyer Fire-control Table (a Mark III system in King George V and Mark II Tables in the others with an Argo range clock replacing the Dreyer-Elphinstone model in the Mark III) located in the transmitting station located on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered <b>telephone.</b> The fire-control <b>table</b> integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. As a backup, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the opinions of}} stakeholders (service commissioners and providers) on how performance data should be presented, {{in order to develop}} effective feedback methods to facilitate the use of these data in decision making. Design. A qualitative analysis of semi-structured face-to-face and <b>telephone</b> interviews. League <b>tables</b> and fictional box plots were presented as an illustrative guide. The themes covered in the interviews were the effectiveness of these two feedback formats, their positive and negative characteristics, and ideas for new and improved feedback mechanisms. Participants. Thirty-six stakeholders representing a range of clinical and non-clinical roles within palliative care and the wider health care system across a variety of statutory and non-statutory organizations from London and the West Midlands. Results. Box plots were received more positively than league tables, and qualitative information was considered more appropriate than pictorial feedback. Conventional methods such as league tables and box plots were judged to lack essential information on which important decisions could be based, such as additional contextual information and the methodological assumptions of the instrument. Both feedback methods were considered useful as an impetus to further discussion. There was a consensus that feedback should be constructive and able to be adapted to the organizational realities in which UK health services function. Conclusion. Qualitative research was viewed as the right evidence for gaining an understanding of the quality of end of life care. Stakeholders highlighted the importance of the lay perspective, which requires approaches that illuminate the subjective meanings of patient experience...|$|R
40|$|M. B. A. Straddling the tropic of Capricorn, land-locked Botswana spans a vast 581, 730 square {{kilometres}} in area. The country shares borders with Namibia to {{the north}} and west, Zambia and Zimbabwe {{to the north}}-east, and South Africa to the east and south. The Botswana Central Statistics Office (CSO) estimate a 2001 population of 1, 68 million with an annual growth rate of 2. 4 % (Annual Economic Report, (2003)). The population is concentrated mainly in the fertile eastern and southern one third of the country. The remaining two thirds of the country's land is covered with the thick sands of the Kgalagadi Desert. Rainfall in the country is sporadic and erratic. According to the 2001 National Census the urban population of the country stands at 52. 1 % with the capital Gaborone accounting for 10. 1 % of the country's population. Francistown, the second and only other city, accounts for 4. 9 % of the country's population. The remainder of the urban population is distributed among 14 smaller urban centres. Gaborone accounts for 26. 9 % of the country's population between the ages of 25 and 54 years (Annual Economic Report, 2003.) 1. 1. 2. Communication The communication network is fairly sophisticated with 19. 4 % of the county's roads paved. The telephone network is fully digital, with Internet, e-mail, fax facilities available in all major centres of the country. Telex, data-switching, satellite-link and voice-mail service are also available nationwide. There are two cellular phone service provides and eleven internet service providers (ISPs). There are 27 Batswana to a <b>telephone.</b> (See <b>Table</b> 1 : Botswana Social Statistics 2001 Table 1 : Botswana Social Statistics: 2001 Life Expectancy 65. 2 Population per Physician 3448 Persons per telephone 27 Persons per radio 95 Daily Newspapers 1 Persons per vehicle 21 Paved roads % 19. 4 Primary School numbers 330, 767 Tertiary education numbers 128, 744 Literacy rate % 70 (Source: Annual Economic Report: 2003) 1. 1. 3. Economic performance Domestic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is estimated to have grown, in nominal terms from P 16. 54 billion (SAR 25, 47 billion) in 2000 / 2001 to P 16. 91 billion (SAR 26, 04 billion) in 2001 / 2002, representing an increase of 2. 3 %. The increase for the previous year had been 17. 2 % (Annual Economic Report 2003) A slump in mining, with a growth rate of 3. 1 % (17. 2 % the previous year) was the major contributor to the slow growth. Banks, Insurance and Business services also shared significant growth among the non-mining sectors of the economy. (See Table 2 : Economic Structure) ...|$|R
