For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor have no reason <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> {{to the amount of}} time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E

[...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt.

500|$|That December, {{at their}} annual meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground, the captains of the {{first-class}} counties discussed {{the problem of}} throwing. MacLaren asked those present at the meeting to give their opinion of Mold's bowling. According to MacLaren, they [...] "replied to a man that they considered that Mold was not always fair". Reports in the press stated that they voted {{by a majority of}} eleven to one that Mold's action was unfair, and that along with other bowlers whose actions were suspected, he should not bowl in the coming season. The captains further recommended that bowlers with illegal actions should be banned, suspended or warned depending on the severity of their transgression. The meeting proved controversial, and disputes arose over how many captains had supported the decision. MacLaren claimed that he was the only captain to support Mold. Despite the verdict of the meeting, Lancashire's committee remained of the opinion that Mold bowled legally; the Lancashire president A. N. Hornby and several of Mold's team-mates also publicly backed the bowler. Opinions among other players and in the press varied as to the fairness of Mold's bowling, but sympathy was expressed for the damage to Mold's career and reputation, while Pelham Warner suggested that it was unfair to ban Mold completely. Some critics believed that the captains should not have passed judgement at all. The MCC, responsible for the laws of cricket and the organisation of the English game, were asked to adjudicate by several county committees. Reluctant to let the decision stand, the MCC overruled the captains, preferring to leave the matter to individual umpires. However, the umpires were instructed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to suspect bowlers during the coming season.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 Ojeda Ríos {{recorded}} a public statement where he accepted responsibility for an explosion {{on the construction}} site of a public project. In this statement he declared that the Macheteros were {{the authors of the}} incident, and that they accepted all responsibility for their actions. Ojeda expressed that they accepted responsibility for the explosion directly because in the past the police has supposedly created false evidence against the organization. On July 18, 1998, Ojeda Ríos admitted that the Macheteros planted bombs at several banks throughout the course of the 1998 Puerto Rican General Strike. The interview was broadcast on WKAQ-AM, a local radio station. Reporters conducting the interview declared they were blindfolded and transported to Ojeda Ríos' hideout where the interview took place.

[...] Two years later, at the first session of the first Saeima of Latvia on 7 November 1922 Čakste was elected unopposed as the first President of the new state, with 92 votes of Saeima members against 6 – the highest number of votes ever given to a candidate in a Latvian presidential election.

2500|$|After his {{displays}} in England's friendlies, Crouch partnered with Michael Owen in attack for England's opening 2006 World Cup match against Paraguay on 10 June 2006. England won the match 1–0 and Crouch kept {{his place in}} the starting line-up for the following match against Trinidad and Tobago, against whom he scored his first competitive international goal. The goal provoked some controversy as replays showed Crouch to be pulling on Brent Sancho's long hair, holding the defender down, to gain an advantage. Crouch was rested for England's third group match against Sweden as Rooney returned from injury to join the starting line-up. However, Owen suffered a serious knee injury in the opening minute of the match and Crouch replaced him, playing the remainder of the match. In England's 1–0 second round victory against Ecuador, Crouch remained an unused substitute as Eriksson switched the team to a new formation with Wayne Rooney as a lone striker. However, after Rooney's dismissal for a foul in England's quarter-final against Portugal, Crouch came on as a substitute for Joe Cole, as England went on to get knocked out on penalties. On 5 September 2007, retired English referee Graham Poll claimed that FIFA had specifically warned referees at the event <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to Crouch, claiming that [...] "he's a real pain and he's getting away with too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Isaac contrasted the Red Cow in [...] and {{the bull}} that the High Priest brought for himself on Yom Kippur in [...] Rabbi Isaac taught that a lay Israelite could {{slaughter}} {{one of the}} two, but not the other, but Rabbi Isaac did not know which was which. The Gemara reported that Rav and Samuel disagreed about the answer. Rav held it invalid for a lay Israelite to slaughter the Red Cow and valid for a lay Israelite to slaughter the High Priest's bull, while Samuel held it invalid for a lay Israelite to slaughter the High Priest's bull and valid for a lay Israelite to slaughter the Red Cow. The Gemara reported that Rav Zeira (or some say Rav Zeira {{in the name of}} Rav) said that the slaughtering of the Red Cow by a lay Israelite was invalid, and Rav deduced from this statement the importance that [...] specifies [...] "Eleazar" [...] and [...] specifies that the law of the Red Cow is a [...] "statute" [...] (and thus required precise execution). But the Gemara challenged Rav's conclusion that the use of the terms [...] "Eleazar" [...] and [...] "statute" [...] in [...] in connection with the Red Cow decided the matter, for in connection with the High Priest's bull, [...] specifies [...] "Aaron," [...] and [...] calls the law of [...] a [...] "statute," [...] as well. The Gemara supposed that the characterization of [...] of the law as a [...] "statute" [...] might apply to only the Temple services described in [...] and the slaughtering of the High Priest's bull might be regarded as not a Temple service. But the Gemara asked whether the same logic might apply to the Red Cow, as well, as it was not a Temple service, either. The Gemara posited that one might consider the Red Cow to have been in the nature of an offering for Temple upkeep. Rav Shisha son of Rav Idi taught that the Red Cow was like the inspection of skin diseases in [...] which was not a Temple service, yet required a priest's participation. The Gemara then turned to Samuel's position, that a lay Israelite could kill the Red Cow. Samuel interpreted the words [...] "and he shall slay it before him" [...] in [...] to mean that a lay Israelite could slaughter the cow as Eleazar watched. The Gemara taught that Rav, on the other hand, explained the words [...] "and he shall slay it before him" [...] in [...] to enjoin Eleazar not to divert his attention from the slaughter of the Red Cow. The Gemara reasoned that Samuel deduced that Eleazer must not divert his attention from the words [...] "and the cow shall be burnt in his sight" [...] in [...] (which one could similarly read to imply an injunction for Eleazar <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention).</b> And Rav explained the words [...] "in his sight" [...] in one place to refer to the slaughtering, and in the other to the burning, and the law enjoined his attention to both. In contrast, the Gemara posited that Eleazar might not have needed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> to the casting in of cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, because they were not part of the Red Cow itself.|$|E
