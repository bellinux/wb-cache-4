5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no {{candidate}} had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, had declined to run; Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old, and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had {{made a name for himself}} by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals. Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the New Hampshire primary by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>announced</b> he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>announced</b> that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E

Repsol executives declared however that government policies would have to change {{in order to allow}} investment in new production. Following bills signed by governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces during March and April 2012 revoking YPF leases accounting for over a fifth of its production, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>announced</b> on April 16 that the Argentine Government would acquire a majority stake in YPF.

René {{was at that time}} the prime minister. René ruled as a strongman under a socialist one-party system until in 1993, when he was forced to introduce a multi-party system. He stepped down in 2004 in favour of his vice-president, James Michel, who was re-elected in 2006 and again in 2011.

25|$|Because Farley {{had been}} {{assigned}} to Coast Guard Headquarters in a senior position in both operations and personnel, Admiral Waesche suggested him as a candidate to succeed him as Commandant. Farley's first nomination was rejected by President Harry S. Truman and Waesche concerned that the Coast Guard would be left without leadership, petitioned Secretary of the Treasury Fred Vinson and Comptroller General Lindsay Warren to speak to the President about the importance of Farley's nomination. Waesche realized that the Coast Guard would have many problems associated with personnel and missions in the post-war period. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>announced</b> Farley's nomination 20 December 1945. After the war many of the top leadership retired because of age, leaving Farley to appoint an almost entirely new headquarters staff.|$|E

At the time, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a US$1.4 billion plant near Puebla, while BMW was planning a US$1 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosí.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Maathai learned of a {{government}} plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, {{and give it to}} political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage. Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>announced</b> that he was banning all allocation of public land.|$|E

500|$|As {{the year}} 1900 began, Hanna hinted {{that he might}} not want to run McKinley's {{re-election}} campaign, stating that he was suffering from rheumatism. [...] In spite of his statement, the senator did want to run the campaign, but McKinley (who apparently saw an opportunity to show the public that he was not Hanna's creature) was slow to ask him. [...] This was a source of great stress to Hanna, who was concerned about the campaign and his relationship with McKinley; the senator fainted in his office during the wait and may have suffered a heart attack. [...] In late May, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>announced</b> that Hanna would run his campaign. Margaret Leech suggested that McKinley was angry at Hanna for unknown reasons, thus the President's [...] "uncharacteristic coldness". [...] Morgan, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the president was using his usual indirect pressure and the power of silence. [...] He wanted and needed Hanna, but on his own terms." ...|$|E
500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>announced</b> in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." [...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: [...] "We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{his time}} as a POW, McCain has been {{recognized}} for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror. In October 2005, McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005, and the Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment. It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners, including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>announced</b> in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would [...] "make {{it clear to the}} world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad". This stance, among others, led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America's 10 Best Senators. McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding, which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush. However, the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected, and his spokesman stated: [...] "This wasn't a vote on waterboarding. This was a vote on applying the standards of the [...] field manual to CIA personnel." ...|$|E

500|$|Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>{{announced}}</b> his resignation, Díaz {{announced on}} the radio that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue {{to fight against the}} invasion of Castillo Armas. He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre and Jose Angel Sánchez. Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told Díaz that he had to resign because, {{in the words of a}} CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, he was [...] "not convenient for American foreign policy". Peurifoy castigated Díaz for allowing Árbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army's main powder magazine, in order to intimidate the colonel. Soon after, Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel Monzón, who was more pliable to U.S. interests. Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him. On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, the Pacto de Las Tunas, three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas, in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, [...] "despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat".|$|E
