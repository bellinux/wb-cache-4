5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that {{the primary purpose of the}} fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to deal with it}} correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content.

25|$|There {{are various}} forms of {{forgiveness}} interventions. One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist. Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and see things from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions. If {{they are able to}} do this then <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to forgive the offender more easily.|$|E
25|$|The plan to {{organize}} the mill workers led to even fiercer battles with the refinery companies, who paid their workers half what miners earned for a ten- to twelve-hour day. When smelter workers went on strike in Colorado City, Colorado in 1903 it appeared that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to win their demands without a serious fight, since the Cripple Creek miners were striking in sympathy with their demands. However, {{when one of the}} smelter operators refused to accept the deal brokered by the Governor of Colorado, James Hamilton Peabody, the Governor called in federal troops.|$|E

25|$|The immense {{size of the}} Union army (the largest on {{the planet}} {{toward the end of}} the Civil War), however, was viewed with {{increasing}} concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of Fenian raids on border communities in New Brunswick by those seeking to end British rule of Ireland. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on Maritime Union, to be held in early September 1864 in Charlottetown â€“ chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance to give up its jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.|$|E

Kate takes the gun from Sawyer and Sayid instructs her on how to dismantle it.|$|E
