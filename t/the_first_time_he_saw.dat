At the age of sixteen, he walked behind the coffin of his uncle, George VI, at his state funeral in 1952, which also was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his uncle, the former Edward VIII, who left the country after having abdicated when the young prince was just twelve months old. In 1953, he attended the coronation of his cousin, Elizabeth II, paying homage at her throne after her coronation (following the Dukes of Edinburgh and Gloucester).|$|E

In 1940 Casey resigned from parliament when Menzies appointed him as the first Australian Ambassador to the United States. This was a vital posting in wartime, but it also served to remove Casey from domestic politics. Casey was in Washington, D.C. when the US entered the war, and {{played an important role}} in establishing the alliance between the US and Australia. In this effort he engaged the services of public relations counselor Earl Newsom.|$|E

500|$|Adkins {{performed}} as a one-man band, using foot pedals {{to play the}} drums, or simply stomped {{his feet on the}} floor to an often detuned guitar. He once vowed that he would play [...] "twelve to twenty" [...] instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with his elbows. He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating that when he was a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own.|$|E
500|$|Born on 10August 1886 at Clinkers Hill near Castlemaine, Victoria, Harrison {{was the son}} of printer and {{stationer}} Joseph Harrison, and his English-born wife Ann. He attended Castlemaine Grammar School {{before starting}} work as a motor mechanic. Keen to fly from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an aeroplane, he travelled to Britain in March 1911 and trained as a pilot at the Bristol School on Salisbury Plain. [...] Six months later, having accumulated some thirty minutes' flight time, he qualified for his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate, becoming only the third Australian to do so. Gaining employment as an instructor for Bristol, he taught flying on behalf of the company in Spain and Italy, as well as in Halberstadt, Germany, where he became aware first-hand of that country's militarism; some of the students he trained and examined later served as pilots in the Luftstreitkräfte during World WarI.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried {{to make it easier for}} her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "July 1st" [...] was {{composed}} by Nagao and Hamasaki. Japanese disc jockey Cool-K also included additional scratching on the track. As H was released during the Japanese summer, Hamasaki decided to incorporate a [...] "summer vibe" [...] to the tracks and, according to Tomita, [...] "July 1st" [...] was her strongest song to feature this. These themes {{had also been}} explored throughout I Am.... The lyrical content is [...] "uplifting and cheerful" [...] and talks about fun experiences; Hamasaki commented, [...] "This {{was the first time}} I had ever written a song [...] from this viewpoint, and I even surprised myself!" [...] "Hanabi" [...] talks about Hamasaki's views of the world, and discusses personal nostalgia. Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper, and Tomita commented that [...] "Hanabi" [...] was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences, rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music. [...] "Hanabi"'s title was written in English characters, and is the Japanese word for fireworks. The title was re-used on her single & for the track [...] "Hanabi (Episode II)".|$|E
500|$|The two Scottish {{players were}} centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively. With Sawyer's help, Shankly signed {{them both in}} the spring of 1961 and {{challenged}} the Liverpool board to [...] "sack me if they can't play". At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats's huge size by inviting the journalists to [...] "go and walk round him; he's a colossus!" [...] Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club's junior teams, so Shankly now had his [...] "strength through the middle" [...] and the team building continued with the transfer of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt. Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him: [...] "Christ, this one can play!" [...] Liverpool had finished third in both 1959–60 and 1960–61 (only the top two clubs were promoted); but the new team gained promotion in the 1961–62 season by winning the Second Division championship, Hunt scoring 41 goals.|$|E
500|$|San Francisco's Dead Kennedys made {{a career}} out of {{mentioning}} Reagan in songs like [...] "Moral Majority," [...] "We've Got a Bigger Problem Now," [...] "Bleed for Me," [...] and the track [...] "Kinky Sex Makes the World Go Round," [...] a spoken word piece about World War III formatted as an erotic phone call between Margaret Thatcher and Reagan's fictitious Secretary of War. [...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist.

500|$|While he {{continued}} to get acquainted with Fitzroy, going shopping together, Darwin rushed around to arrange his supplies and equipment, getting advice from experts on specimen preservation such as William Yarrell at the Zoological Society of London, Robert Brown at the British Museum, Captain Phillip Parker King who led the first expedition, and invertebrate anatomist Robert Edmond Grant who had tutored Darwin at Edinburgh. Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid £50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent £400 on firearms. On Sunday 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick, and had a pleasant [...] "sail of three days". For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the [...] "very small" [...] cramped ship, met the officers, and was glad to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes. On Friday Darwin rushed back to London, [...] "250 miles in 24 hours", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October. Delays to the Beagle gave Darwin an extra week to consult experts and complete packing his baggage. After sending his heavy goods down by steam packet, he took the coach along with Augustus Earle, and arrived at Devonport on 24 October.|$|E
500|$|Marko: The male {{lead of the}} series, Marko is Alana's {{husband and}} Hazel's father. He is from Landfall's moon Wreath, whose people have horns or antlers and can wield magic. Marko was a foot soldier in his people's war against the Coalition of Landfall. He was raised since a young age with the {{knowledge}} of the atrocities that Landfall committed against their people. When Marko left Wreath as an adult, he was still [...] "a gung-ho kid who just wanted to do [...] moon proud and kick some ass." [...] This changed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> battle, after which he began to develop a less militant and more pacifist outlook. When he tried to share these misgivings with his fiancée Gwen, he realized from her unsympathetic and jingoistic responses that they had grown too far apart to continue their relationship. Marko surrendered to Coalition forces as a [...] "conscientious objector" [...] 18 months before the beginning of the series. He was a prisoner of war on the planet Cleave until his guard, Alana, escaped with him, married him and conceived their daughter, Hazel. Wreath High Command sent The Will after Marko because Marko [...] "renounced his oath and betrayed The Narrative" [...] by fraternizing with an enemy combatant. Though he is a pacifist who vows upon the birth of his daughter to never again use his sword, and dislikes the practice of owning firearms, he does so nonetheless when his family is threatened and is so skilled with a sword that he can dispatch an entire squad of enemy soldiers armed with firearms, for which he is referred to by Prince Robot IV as a [...] "force of nature".|$|E

[...] "On more than one occasion, he said 'I've got the right two guys' — almost like a cheerleader", Trump said, alleging Crane also showed him a Tribune newspaper with Ferguson's photo and said it would be [...] "helpful" [...] for him to identify Ferguson as having been at the crime scene.|$|E

This is when [...] "ace high" [...] was changed from the original form in which aces were low. [...] Addington said <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the game was in 1959. [...] "They didn't call it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em.… I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game. Draw poker, you bet only twice; hold 'em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man's game." ...|$|E

[...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you."

After the Observers' arrival, Walter had Olivia (Anna Torv) retrieve a device to help restore these memories, but she had disappeared. [...] In the present, they trace Olivia's path, finding a nearby patch of amber, but cut into with several human-sized chunks removed.

2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to keep my mouth shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E
2500|$|Casting for {{the lead}} {{characters}} of NBC police procedural television drama series [...] occurred {{in the spring of}} 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Detective Olivia Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male role – Detective Elliot Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together and after the actors left, {{there was a moment of}} dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, [...] "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni." [...] The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.|$|E
