50|$|Tube {{amplifiers}} {{are usually}} heavier than an equivalently powered <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifier.</b> As tubes {{are made of}} glass, tube amplifiers are more fragile than a solid state amp.|$|E
50|$|Typical (non-OTL) tube power {{amplifiers}} could not use as much negative feedback (NFB) as <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{due to the}} large phase shifts caused by the output transformers and their lower stage gains. While the absence of NFB greatly increases harmonic distortion, it avoids instability, as well as slew rate and bandwidth limitations imposed by dominant-pole compensation in <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> However, the effects of using low feedback principally apply only to circuits where significant phase shifts are an issue (e.g. {{power amplifiers}}). In preamplifier stages, high amounts of negative feedback can easily be employed. Such designs are commonly found from many tube-based applications aiming to higher fidelity.|$|R

50|$|Linear {{circuits}} involving transistors typically require specific DC voltages and currents for correct operation, {{which can}} be achieved using a biasing circuit. As {{an example of the}} need for careful biasing, consider a <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In linear amplifiers, a small input signal gives larger output signal without any change in shape (low distortion): the input signal causes the output signal to vary up and down about the Q-point in a manner strictly proportional to the input. However, because a transistor is nonlinear, the <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifier</b> only approximates linear operation. For low distortion, the transistor must be biased so the output signal swing does not drive the transistor into a region of extremely nonlinear operation. For a bipolar <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifier,</b> this requirement means that the transistor must stay in the active mode, and avoid cut-off or saturation. The same requirement applies to a MOSFET amplifier, although the terminology differs a little: the MOSFET must stay in the active mode (or saturation mode), and avoid cut-off or ohmic operation (or triode mode).|$|E

50|$|The {{electronic}} control system was designed with redundant channels that used 2 of 2 logic. The outputs of each primary channel were compared on a continuous basis. If a fault was detected in the primary control system, then control was automatically switched to an identical backup channel and the pilot immediately took measures to bring the vehicle to the ground. All the controls were analog circuits utilizing Burr-Brown <b>transistor</b> <b>amplifier</b> modules and other analog components. Unlike modern digital control circuits, in 1967 the technology available was limited to discrete transistors.|$|E
