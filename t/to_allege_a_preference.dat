50|$|On September 8, 2016, Reeves {{issued a}} ruling dismissing a lawsuit seeking {{to have the}} Mississippi state flag, which {{contains}} the Stars and Bars emblem of the Confederacy declared unconstitutional. The basis of the dismissal is the plaintiff's failure <b>to</b> <b>allege</b> <b>a</b> specific injury and thus an inability to demonstrate the standing necessary {{to bring an action}} in federal court.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Earl, in {{an analogy}} {{to a similar}} case, wrote: [...] "The {{principle}} which lies {{at the bottom of}} the maxim, volenti non fit injuria a willing person, no injury be done', should be applied to such a case, and a widow should not, for the purpose of acquiring, as such, property rights, be permitted <b>to</b> <b>allege</b> <b>a</b> widowhood which she has wickedly and intentionally created." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{an opinion}} {{authored}} by Justice White, the Court held, 5-4, that Lyons had failed <b>to</b> <b>allege</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently plausible threat of future injury to have standing for an injunction; Lyons did, however, have standing for his damages action, {{since this was}} retrospective and the injury — being subjected to the chokehold — was concrete and particular. The decision helped establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for each form of relief sought.|$|R

5000|$|The Sixth Circuit {{agreed with}} the lower court that Pulte failed <b>to</b> <b>allege</b> <b>an</b> “access” claim. <b>To</b> state an access claim, a {{plaintiff}} must show that the defendant “intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization.” [...] A person acting “without authorization” has “no rights, limited or otherwise, to access the computer in question.” [...] The court reasoned that Pulte’s phone and email systems were open to the public, so LIUNA was authorized to use them. Because Pulte did not allege that LIUNA possessed no right to contact Pulte’s offices and its executives, it failed to satisfy this element of its claim.|$|R
