They also asked {{to speak to the}} cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E

5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{detained}} {{health workers}} {{stated that they}} were ill-treated or tortured while in custody, leading Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to call for independent investigations. Authorities reportedly forced detainees to stand for long periods, beat them with boards and rubber hoses, and deprived them of sleep {{in an effort to}} force confessions. In one case, a prisoner alleged that he had been forced to sign papers while blindfolded. Dr. Fatima Haji alleged that she was blindfolded and beaten {{in an effort to make}} her confess to faking the injuries to protesters during her Al Jazeera interview; she later identified her interrogator as a distant relative of the king. Ibrahim al-Demastani, head of the Bahrain Nurse's Society, alleged that he was deliberately kicked and kneed by guards in his back at a spot where he had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had a prolapsed disc; he was then denied medical care until he happened to meet a police officer to whom he had once taught first aid.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had killed Fryer following {{an argument about}} her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E

60|$|Thomas {{threatened}} to excommunicate them all, a menace {{which did not}} amount to much as they were already excommunicating themselves, and when they remained obstinate, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>he</b> would {{have nothing to do}} with this rain-making business, which was unholy and repugnant to him. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> moreover, that <b>he</b> was certain that their wickedness would bring some judgment upon <b>them,</b> in which <b>he</b> proved to be right.|$|R
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Dwyer asked his press {{secretary}} Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny {{to set up}} a news conference for the next day without telling them what he was to discuss. Horshock arranged the press conference for 10:30a.m. EST the next day, January 22. The press secretary called dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> did not know its subject.|$|E
25|$|When Grossman signed Janis Joplin and {{her four}} bandmates from Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1967, he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> would not {{tolerate}} any intravenous drug use, and all five agreed {{to abide by the}} rule. When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500.|$|E
25|$|Mead {{explained}} that Lofty is a trained nurse who, {{prior to his}} introduction, was living with his parents and using their money to party. Lofty repeatedly told his parents that he would {{apply for a job}} and find a house, which he never did. His parents grew tired of him and his father asked him to move out so Lofty lied and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had found a house. In May 2017, Mead revealed that Lofty's backstory would be explored following his introduction to Holby City, with the character's reasons for joining the nursing profession explained.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak later {{met with}} Teoh's family {{to express his}} condolences. Najib <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> would direct the Attorney-General and {{relevant}} government departments to look into Teoh's family's wish that his child bear the Teoh surname. On 15 August 2009, Soh completed the traditional Chinese marriage ceremonies, together with Teoh Lee Lan, Beng Hock's younger sister, acting as a proxy. Kerk Kim Hock, a distant uncle of Teoh and the family's acting spokesperson, told the press that completion of the marriage rites now entitled Soh to have her name engraved on Teoh's gravestone as his wife.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> {{was working on}} getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job {{and that he was}} researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They never saw him again.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte was one {{of several}} Yankees named in the Mitchell Report, {{released}} on December 13, 2007. Mitchell and his staff received the information on Pettitte from McNamee, who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> injected Pettitte with HGH on 2–4 occasions in 2002 so that he would heal from an elbow injury quicker. Pettitte verified McNamee's claim, admitting to using the HGH on two occasions in 2002, as it was meant to help heal an injury, and not to enhance his performance. Pettitte said he felt an obligation to return to the team as quickly as possible. He denied any further usage of HGH during his career; he also denied use of steroids or any other performance-enhancing drug.|$|E

25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Diamond gave filmmaker Greg Kohs {{permission}} to use his songs in a documentary. Kohs, a director from Philadelphia, had met a popular Milwaukee, Wisconsin, duo, Lightning & Thunder, composed of Mike Sardina, who did a Diamond impersonation, and his wife Claire. Kohs followed them for eight years and produced the film Song Sung Blue, but he needed {{permission to}} use Diamond's songs. The movie {{was sent to the}} singer in January 2008, at the recommendation of Eddie Vedder, a supporter of the film and of the duo. Though Sardina had died in 2006, Diamond invited his widow and her family to be his front-row guests at his show in Milwaukee, where he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> was moved by the film.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
