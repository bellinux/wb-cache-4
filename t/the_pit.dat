5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> The larva readies <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, the mechanic of E.T. falling into <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> was amended so that a keypress was required before the player fell into <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> The holes were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the bottom left of the screen.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E
40|$|The {{sea urchin}} Anthocidaris crassispina (A. Agassiz) lives either in small <b>pits</b> or outside <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> on rock surfaces. Difference in {{movement}} between individuals living {{inside and outside}} <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> was investigated. Sea urchins living inside <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> never moved out of their pits either in summer or winter, or during the day or night, while urchins living outside <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> moved in both seasons, especially during the night. Among urchins living outside <b>the</b> <b>pits,</b> individuals occupying relatively sheltered microhabitats (hollows or edges; see Fig. 1) exhibited less movement than individuals occupying open flats. On transplantation to an open area without pits, some individuals previously occupying <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> showed slight movement. On the other hand, most of the individuals previously outside <b>the</b> <b>pits,</b> when transplanted into an area with many vacant pits, occupied them and showed reduced movement, although neither transplanted groups of individuals adjusted their movement perfectly to their new microhabitats during the observation period. These {{results suggest that the}} movement of the sea urchins is, to some extent, flexible and dependent on microhabitats and that they preferred sheltered microhabitats. A morphological and physiological investigation showed that sea urchins inside <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> had similar gut weight (with the content), shorter lateral spines and heavier gonads than sea urchins outside <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> of similar test diameter. The adaptive significance of pit-dwelling in A. crassispina is discussed...|$|R
25|$|At {{the moment}} of caution, pit road is {{immediately}} closed.

50|$|In July 1989 {{demolition}} {{was completed}} {{of the original}} No.1 roundhouse building along with the mess room adjacent to No.2 shed. After the demolition of No.1 shed <b>the</b> turntable <b>pit</b> and surrounding radial roads were nominally raised by 470mm to lessen the effect of groundwater. As part of this raising all of <b>the</b> servicing <b>pits</b> surrounding No.1 turntable were in filled. In 1991 further modifications took place to <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> surrounding No.2 turntable, with the outdoor section of <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> on roads 6 & 7 being infilled so that <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> only ran inside of <b>the</b> shed. <b>The</b> <b>pits</b> on 8 to 10 roads along with <b>the</b> drop <b>pits</b> on roads 8 & 9 were also filled in. The 2 surviving outdoor 'Garratt' inspection pits on roads 25 & 26 were also filled in.|$|R
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> exit, pushing him over the white line separating <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass and <b>the</b> <b>Pit</b> is a British {{television}} science-fiction serial transmitted live by BBC Television in December 1958 and January 1959. It was {{the third}} and last of the BBC's Quatermass serials, although the chief character, Professor Bernard Quatermass, reappeared in a 1979 ITV production called Quatermass. Like its predecessors, Quatermass and <b>the</b> <b>Pit</b> was written by Nigel Kneale.|$|E

50|$|In 1950 a {{train driver}} noticed a void beneath {{the tracks and}} it became {{apparent}} that work was required to stabilise <b>the</b> <b>pits.</b> <b>The</b> original timbers were removed and <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> spanned with prefabricated concrete beams reinforced with bullhead rail and shear links. One more beam was fabricated than was required for the work and this was stored in a nearby yard. Again it was not recorded whether <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> were filled.|$|R

5|$|A script book of Quatermass and <b>the</b> <b>Pit</b> was {{released}} by Penguin Books in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother Bryan Kneale. In 1979 this was re-published by Arrow Books {{to coincide with the}} transmission of the fourth and final Quatermass serial on ITV; this edition featured a new introduction by Kneale. The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation of Quatermass and <b>the</b> <b>Pit</b> in a quarry near Nottingham in August 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{nationalisation}} after World War II the National Coal Board spent £500,000 on modernising the mine's {{infrastructure to}} give it the capability for annual production of 315,000tons, however manpower shortages and geological problems caused <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> to close in 1966.|$|E

50|$|Improper {{storage can}} promote {{corrosion}} of <b>the</b> <b>pits.</b> <b>The</b> AL-R8 containers {{used in the}} Pantex facility for storage of <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> are said to promote instead of hinder corrosion, and tend to corrode themselves. The decay heat released by <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> is also a concern; some pits in storage can reach temperatures as high as 150 °C, and the storage facilities for larger numbers of pits may require active cooling. Humidity control can also present problems for pit storage.|$|R

5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near <b>the</b> <b>pit,</b> showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to <b>the</b> <b>pit,</b> and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around <b>the</b> <b>pit,</b> as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Sainz Jr., who had {{qualified}} {{in eighth}} position, was adjudged to have missed {{a call to}} go to the weigh bridge during the first part of qualifying. Following the session, he was given a penalty which required him to start the race from <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane.|$|E

5|$|Later, Kate {{appears as}} part of Batman and Robin: Blackest Knight. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She is sealed within a coffin and taken {{underground}} to the last remaining Lazarus Pit {{in order for the}} ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes Knight and Squire. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her. True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by Darkseid) emerges from <b>the</b> <b>Pit</b> and attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Pit,</b> causing a massive cave-in. Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her. Kate is healed after being placed inside <b>the</b> <b>Pit,</b> and she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has a thing for red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, Barbara Gordon and Starfire), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.|$|E

5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} <b>the</b> <b>pitting</b> {{resistance}} of {{gray cast iron}} containing about 3. 5 ~ 3. 7 % C, which was cast or heat-treatment, {{was carried out by}} performing experiments using a Nishihara-type wear testing machine under sliding condition with light oil as a lubricant.
