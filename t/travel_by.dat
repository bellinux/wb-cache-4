5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of roads in the Middle Ages, <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> sea was an {{important}} transport corridor.

5|$|While {{a direct}} route by sea {{has not been}} {{available}} since {{the sinking of the}} Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7p.m. and 10a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations. Alternatively, it is possible to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.|$|E
5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof.

The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> personal bus rather than flying (which has been an anxiety trigger in the past for white).

5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

5|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century {{dramatically}} increased <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> European-Americans in the area, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on.

5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants <b>travel</b> <b>by</b> walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
