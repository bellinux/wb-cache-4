He also broke Owen Davidson's record for most such titles in gentlemen's section. Paes qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Men's Doubles, and partnered with Rohan Bopanna. They lost {{in the first round}} to the Polish pair of Marcin Matkowski and Łukasz Kubot. He later paired up with Andre Begemann, where they reached the final in the Winston-Salem Open. <b>This</b> <b>pair</b> lost {{in the first round of}} 2016 US Open.

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other.

This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.|$|E

40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of my father, Om P. Sinha In this paper we develop a {{canonical}} pairing between trees and graphs, which passes to their quotients by Jacobi identities. <b>This</b> <b>pairing</b> is an effective and simple tool for understanding the Lie and Poisson operads, providing canonical duals. In the course of showing that <b>this</b> <b>pairing</b> is perfect we reprove some standard facts about the modules Lie(n), establishing standard bases as well as giving a new means to reduce to those bases. We then move on to show how <b>this</b> <b>pairing</b> may be used to define functionals on free Lie algebras, and to develop product, coproduct and (co) operad structures. <b>This</b> <b>pairing</b> arises as the pairing between canonical bases for homology and cohomology of configurations in Euclidean space, and thus has been known implicitly for thirty years. Indeed, the (co) product and (co) operad structures we develop are manifestations of the topology of configuration spaces. <b>This</b> <b>pairing</b> first appears, to our knowledge, in a different guise in work of Melancon and Reutenaur on odd-graded free Lie algebras; see Section 4. The pairing was independently applied by Tourtchine [10, 11]; see further commentary at the end of Section 1.

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and <b>this</b> <b>pair</b> of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. <b>This</b> <b>pair</b> formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders <b>this</b> <b>pair</b> of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; <b>this</b> <b>pair</b> of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind <b>this</b> <b>pair</b> of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use <b>this</b> <b>pair</b> for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E
