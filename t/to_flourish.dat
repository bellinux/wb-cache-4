5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire.

5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, <b>to</b> <b>flourish</b> where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E

40|$|Managing other people's work {{is filled}} with challenges, and among them, {{understanding}} what motivates people is essential. In order to pursue organizational objectives effectively and to develop skills and virtues that lead <b>to</b> <b>flourishing</b> in the workplace, motivation has to be properly understood and explained. This paper contends that the classical and most popular taxonomies describing employee motives and needs have either neglected or minimized {{the importance of the}} ethical and spiritual dimensions of motivation, resulting in a model of a person as self-interested, amoral and non‐spiritual. In this article, the authors attempt to overcome this idea through an integration of the areas of psychology, ethics and theology, offering an expanded taxonomy of motivation, focusing especially on the workplace, which explicitly includes morality and spirituality. This effort is a significant step toward articulating a more complete and accurate description of motivation that brings out the full dimensions of being human, which is conduciveto improved management practices leading <b>to</b> <b>flourishing</b> in the workplace, and fostering ethically healthier organizations...|$|R

5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation.

In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began <b>to</b> <b>flourish</b> despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
