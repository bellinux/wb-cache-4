5|$|The film often {{features}} shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water.

More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed,</b> cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E

25|$|John Enoch Powell {{was born}} in Stechford, Birmingham, on 16 June 1912. He lived there {{for the first six}} years of his life before his parents moved to Kings Norton in 1918, where he lived until 1930. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell (1872–1956), a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1886–1953). Ellen was the {{daughter}} of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman and his wife Eliza, who had given up her own teaching career after marrying. His mother did not like his name, and as a child he was known as 'Jack'. At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed 'the Professor' because he used to stand on a chair and describe <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> birds his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents' home.|$|E
25|$|Lord's is {{the home}} of the MCC Museum, which is the oldest sports museum in the world, and {{contains}} the world's most celebrated collection of cricket memorabilia, including The Ashes urn.

Grace; and curiosities such as <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> sparrow that was 'bowled out' by Jahangir Khan of Cambridge University in delivering a ball to T. N. Pearce batting for MCC on 3 July 1936.

500|$|While the eponymous song [...] "Remember You" [...] {{is being}} sung, the episode flashes back almost a {{thousand}} years before {{the events of the}} episode. A young Marceline is seen crying in the wreckage of a city, presumably after the cataclysmic Mushroom War. Simon Petrikov sees her from a distance and runs over. In an attempt to comfort her, he gives her Hambo, a teddy bear, that he finds in the ruins of a toy store.

500|$|Weinstein {{said that}} this episode was an {{opportunity}} for him, Oakley, and Swartzwelder to [...] "go nuts" [...] with the [...] "Burns-ism". He said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Burns and Abe Simpson because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because they get to use thesauruses for looking up [...] "old time slang". For example, Burns answers the phone by saying [...] "Ahoy, hoy!", which was suggested by Alexander Graham Bell {{to be used as}} the proper telephone answer when the telephone was first invented. Burns' kitchen is full of [...] "crazy old-time" [...] devices and contraptions. For inspiration, Weinstein brought in [...] "a bunch" [...] of old books with designs of old kitchen devices. Oakley commented that <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> polar bear had always been in Burns' office, and they were excited to [...] "finally" [...] have a use for it.|$|E
500|$|Morgans {{were used}} as cavalry mounts by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War. Horses with Morgan roots {{included}} Sheridan's Winchester, also known as Rienzi, (a descendent of Black Hawk). Stonewall Jackson's [...] "Little Sorrel" [...] has alternately been described as a Morgan or an American Saddlebred, a breed heavily influenced by the Morgan. While Morgan enthusiasts have stated that the horse Comanche, the only survivor of the Custer regiment after the Battle of the Little Big Horn, was either a Morgan or a Mustang/Morgan mix, records of the U.S. Army and other early sources do not support this. Most accounts state that Comanche was either of [...] "Mustang lineage" [...] or a mix of [...] "American" [...] and [...] "Spanish" [...] blood. The University of Kansas Natural History Museum, which has <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> body of Comanche on display, makes no statement as to his breed. All sources agree that Comanche originated in the Oklahoma or Texas area, making his Mustang background more likely.|$|E

500|$|Finally, Bewick {{acknowledges}} {{anyone who}} helped. The musk duck is stated {{to have been}} drawn from a [...] "living specimen" [...] which was however [...] "excepting the head, entirely white", unlike the [...] "general appearance" [...] shown in the woodcut; the bird [...] "was lent to this work by William Losh, Esq., of Point Pleasant, near Newcastle". Losh, one of Bewick's many collaborators, was a wealthy partner in Losh, Wilson and Bell, manufacturers of chemicals and iron. Many of the birds, especially the rarer species, were necessarily illustrated from skins rather than from life. For example, for the Sabine's snipe, [...] "The author was favoured by N. A. Vigors, Esq., [...] with a preserved specimen, from which the above figure is taken." [...] In A Memoir (posthumously published in 1862), Bewick states {{that he intended to}} [...] "stick to nature as closely as I could", but admits that he had [...] "in several cases" [...] to rely on <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> [...] "preserved skins" [...] of his neighbour Richard Routledge Wingate.|$|E
500|$|Cibber's {{appointment}} as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely {{assumed to be}} a political rather than artistic honour, and a reward for his untiring support of the Whigs, the party of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Most of the leading writers, such as Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and Henry Fielding, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were Tories. Cibber's verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies, some of which Cibber claimed in his Apology to have written himself. In the 20th century, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Lee considered some of Cibber's laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic [...] "anthology of bad verse", <b>The</b> <b>Stuffed</b> Owl (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.|$|E
500|$|Late that night, on {{the night}} of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms {{carrying}} pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family [...] "Well, we're {{going to get out of}} this place." [...] They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.|$|E
