Also, residents ’ travelling could be induced and guided in order that the condition of urban transport can be improved. Based on the above background, this paper is mainly based on mobile phone base station data and GIS data analysis method research on the urban transportation of residents ’ <b>travelling</b> <b>track...</b>|$|E

It is in the region called North Burnett. When we travel, we follow the river systems and look out for distinct markers in the landscape.

40|$|These {{two images}} {{that make up}} one large artwork, focus on {{historical}} facts, life pathways and travelling across land: Country. They tell and show {{the story of a}} tree that sits within a specific geographic landscape. E. g. ‘this tree stands steadfast along my inland <b>travelling</b> <b>track,</b> near the town of Mundubbera (Mun-dub-bur-ra) on the land of the Wakka Wakka people’. The focus of the tree is on its location without saying exactly where it is, maintaining a sense of private/public knowledge along with the look of the tree including its burled bark covering. ‘Burls are caused by an injury, virus or fungus, and appear where the tree undergoes some type of stress. Most burls grow beneath the ground and are attached to the roots. They are almost always covered by bark, even when under the ground’. This artwork was interconnected with the other works in the Capricornia Arts Mob’s NAIDOC Exhibition and curated by Dr Pamela CroftWarcon to the NAIDOC theme: we value the vision: Yirrkala Bark Petitions. The exhibition was installed in the Walter Reid Gallery, Rockhampton, Queensland as part of the Capricornia Arts Mob’s NAIDOC Exhibition from 01 – 13 July 2013.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{is made to}} unravel the run-out {{characteristics}} of a mass movement in the Sichuan Province, SW China by means of 1 D numerical modelling and calibration on the topography of run-out profiles. The Dagou mass movement started as a rockslide with an initial volume of 480, 000 m 3, which transformed into a debris flow, increasing in volume due to entrainment of loose material in {{the upper part of}} the <b>travelling</b> <b>track.</b> The rapid mass movement had a run-out distance of 1380 m and a run-out time of about 50 s. Numerical calculations were conducted with the depth average shallow water equation to explain the variation in thickness of the debris flowdeposits along the run-out track. For the calibration of the first run-out phase, three rheologicalmodels were applied, namely the Bingham, Voellmy and Quadratic rheology. Calibrationwas done on 1) the run-out distance, 2) the run-out time and 3) the goodness of fit with the thickness of the deposits along the track. In addition the erosion constant in the entrainment equation was calibrated on the observed versus calculated run-out volumes. Sensitivity analyses of the resistance parameters for the different rheologies showed that the viscosity, the basal friction, the turbulence term and the resistance factor are the most sensitive ones. It appeared that the variation in thickness along the run-out track can be explained by entrainment of material in {{the upper part of the}} track and a change in parametric values during the run-out process. The three rheologies produced a reasonable fit with the observed geometry of the run-out profile, run-out time and run-out volume. It was argued that the Voellmy rheology seems to give the most appropriate explanation for the difference in resistance along the run-out path. The main problem in the simulation was to stop the debris flow on a slope with a gradient around 22 °. A reactivation of the mass movement by frictional sliding of the material halfway the run-out track was simulated. It occurred 30 min after the first run-out phase due to an increase in pore pressure. The sliding material changed into a slow flowing mass that reached a newly built up area after about 1 h and moved into Wangong Town over a distance of 80 m...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{existence}} and uniqueness of solution of a specific differential equation is studied. This equation originates from the description of a coupled process by totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and Langmuir kinetics (LK). In the fields of physics and biology, {{the properties of the}} TASEP-LK coupled process have been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical calculations, as well as detailed experiments. However, so far, no rigorous mathematical analysis has been given to the corresponding differential equations, especially their existence and uniqueness of solution. In this paper, using the upper and lower solution method, {{the existence}} of solution of the steady state equation is obtained. Then using a generalized maximum principle, we show that the solution constructed from the upper and lower solution method is actually the unique solution in C^∞ space. Moreover, {{the existence and}} uniqueness of solution of the time dependent differential equation are also obtained in one specific space X^β. Our results imply that the previous results obtained by numerical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are theoretically correct, especially the most important phase diagram of particle density along the <b>travel</b> <b>track</b> under different model parameters. The study in this paper provides theoretical foundations for the analysis of TASEP-LK coupled process. At the same time, the methods used in this paper may be instructive for studies about the more general cases of the TASEP-LK process, such as the one with multiple <b>travel</b> <b>tracks</b> or the one with multiple particle species...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{adhesive}} power of a tire {{with respect to the}} road involves several properties which result from the purpose of the tire; namely, connecting link between vehicle and road: (1) The tire must transfer the tractive and braking forces acting in the direction of travel (tractive and braking adhesion). (2) The tire is to prevent lateral deviations of the vehicle from the desired direction of <b>travel</b> (<b>track</b> adhesion). Moreover, the rubber tire provides part of the springing of the vehicle. Above all, it has to level out the minor road irregularities; thus it smoothes, as it were, the road and simultaneously reduces the noise of driving. The springing properties of the tire affect the adhesive power. The tests described below comprise a determination of the braking and track adhesion of individual tires. The adhesion of driven wheels has not been investigated so far. *"Versuche zur Feststellung des Haftverm_gens von Personenwagen-Bereifungen", Deutsche Kraftfahrtforschung, Technischer Forschungsbericht...|$|R
