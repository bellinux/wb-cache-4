5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E

25|$|If human {{understanding}} were {{restricted to}} discursive or verbal arguments, then Plato's dialectical discussions could at most {{have reached the}} conclusion that the highest principle was demanded by his metaphysics but also that human understanding could never arrive at that transcendental Being. If so, the only remaining way that the One might be reached (and the Good, if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the One) is through the possibility of some nonverbal, 'intuitive' access. It is debated whether or not Plato in fact took this route. If he did, he thereby renounced the possibility of justifying every step made by our knowledge with philosophical arguments that can be expressed discursively in words.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{was divided}} in two administrative counties 1719–1996. Coats of arms were created for these entities, also using the griffin motif. The new Skåne County, operative from 1 January 1997, got {{a coat of}} arms <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the province's, but with reversed tinctures. When the county arms is shown with a Swedish royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of central government authority. In 1999 the two county councils (landsting) were amalgamated forming Region Skåne. It is the only of its kind using a heraldic coat of arms. It is also {{the same as the}} province's and the county's, but with a golden griffin's head on a blue shield. The 33 municipalities within the county also have coats of arms.|$|E

25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
25|$|The third {{method is}} to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a {{four-year}} degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For {{the first two years}} in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an academic degree that emphasizes research and nursing theory. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).|$|E
25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E

500|$|It {{is thought}} that global dimming is {{probably}} due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere caused by human action. [...] Aerosols and other particulates absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets. Water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. [...] Increased pollution causes more particulates and thereby creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of water is spread over more droplets). The smaller droplets make clouds more reflective, so that more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space and less reaches the Earth's surface. This same effect also reflects radiation from below, trapping it in the lower atmosphere. In models, these smaller droplets also decrease rainfall.|$|E
