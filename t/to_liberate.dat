5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} factors, the revolt was often considered to either be a {{manipulation of the}} commoners by a reactionary elite against modernization, a successful Ottoman bid to hamper Egypt's efforts <b>to</b> <b>liberate</b> and unify its Arab lands, or was sidelined. The concept that the revolt's diverse participants were acting {{based on their own}} interests and actual grievances rather than manipulation was largely ignored in Palestinian historiography until recent decades.|$|E

5|$|The absolutist {{restoration}} in Spain and {{the growing}} influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Martín's plan was complicated as well by the Disaster of Rancagua, a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the Patria Vieja period. San Martín initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a larger one, <b>to</b> <b>liberate</b> the country from the occupation. Chileans Bernardo O'Higgins, José Miguel Carrera, Luis Carrera and Manuel Rodríguez, {{the leaders of the}} deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodríguez were well received, but the Carrera brothers intended to act as a government in exile. They ignored the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Martín imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan <b>to</b> <b>liberate</b> Chile, different to the one outlined by San Martín, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carrera and San Martín.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished <b>to</b> <b>liberate</b> the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill <b>to</b> <b>liberate</b> Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E
