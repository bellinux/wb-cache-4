25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a nonfictional element, {{but more often than not}} the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|However, Poincaré's {{resolution}} led to {{a paradox}} when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to {{the frame of the}} moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E
25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|E

25|$|However, {{since only}} matter and {{electromagnetic}} energy are directly observable by experiment (not the non-em-fluid), Poincaré's resolution still violates the reaction principle and the COM-theorem, when an emission/absorption process is practically considered. This {{leads to a}} paradox when changing frames: if waves are radiated in a certain direction, the device will suffer a recoil from {{the momentum of the}} fictitious fluid. Then, Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to first order in v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold.

25|$|Myiasis is {{the leading}} entomological {{evidence}} used to prove abuse, and neglect in animals. Leading causes of myiasis in animals occur {{when there is an}} injury or the presence of excretory material, making the living animal alluring to insects. The following characteristics have to be present for myiasis to happen in a pet animal. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abuse or neglect that causes an injury with blood, decaying tissue, feces or urine that attracts flies and the animals must be fairly helpless or incapable of cleaning itself. In long-coated animals, matts and burrs can cause irritation which leads to hot spots, scratching, open lacerations, and infestation. Animals with long mats and coats are especially prone to the building of excrement around the genital area. This circumstance worsens when the animal is elderly or hindered and can no longer clean itself. Risk factors are further intensified if the animals spends most of its life outdoors and is vulnerable to the external environments. Regular grooming and check-ups can significantly reduce these risks. In addition, eliminating other fly attractants, such as uneaten food and fecal matter, can also reduce risks. The summer season is when the highest risk occurs because insects are more common during this time.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more focus in biology." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. Actor Markinson, upon seeing the costume, said [...] "this is what's driving me crazy?" [...] Director Kim Manners was highly critical of the monster and later told people that after the episode would air, his career would be [...] "over". Gilligan attributed the problems due to the episodic work schedule, he noted, [...] "we're usually on such a short schedule that <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a weak link somewhere". Gilligan also stated that the [...] "over engineered" [...] aspects of the suit made it somewhat comical. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the filmed footage to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who [...] "took the footage with the monster in it, erased the monster completely, took the monster to a different screen [...] animated it, and added speed blur". The effects took a large amount of time to complete. They were only finished at 7:30 the morning the episode was scheduled to air. In the end, the monster is not clearly visible in the installment, which allowed the scariness of the episode to be more real, according to Gilligan.|$|E
500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.'
