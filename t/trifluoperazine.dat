50|$|Prolactin {{secretion}} in the pituitary {{is normally}} suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine.

However, since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.|$|E

40|$|The role of calmodulin in insulin {{secretion}} from rat pancreatic islets {{has been}} {{examined by the}} use of <b>trifluoperazine,</b> an inhibitor of calmodulin-Ca++-directed functions.

Therefore, the site of action of <b>trifluoperazine</b> in glucose stimulus-secretion coupling appears to be after the trioses. As <b>trifluoperazine</b> had no effect upon insulin release stimulated by 1 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, the inhibitory effect of <b>trifluoperazine</b> appears to be rather specific. Further, the process of exocytosis per se is not affected. It was also found that although <b>trifluoperazine</b> inhibited the effect of glucose to stimulate insulin release, it did not affect the synergism between glucose and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine to potentiate insulin release. It may be concluded that <b>trifluoperazine</b> selectively inhibits one part of the mechanism by which glucose stimulates insulin release. Calmodulin plays a role in the stimulation of insulin release by glucose at a site between metabolism of trioses and elevation of cytosol Ca++, but is not involved in the final process of exocytosis...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that bleomycin-induced {{pulmonary}} fibrosis is accompanied by elevated levels of calcium and calmodulin, which are important in the regulation of many biologic processes. The authors have further extended these observations and assessed the effect of a calmodulin inhibitor, <b>trifluoperazine,</b> on bleomycin-induced lung damage with biochemical, morphometric, and bronchoalveolar lavage techniques. The cumulative mortality due to bleomycin was not significantly reduced in animals receiving <b>trifluoperazine.</b> <b>Trifluoperazine</b> had no apparent effect on lung levels of collagen and DNA elevated by bleomycin. However, morphometric studies showed that the volume density of the lesion, the volume of amorphous material and interstitial inflammation, and the number of monocytes within lesions were less in the lungs of bleomycin-treated hamsters receiving <b>trifluoperazine</b> daily. When compared with hamsters treated with bleomycin alone, animals treated with both bleomycin and <b>trifluoperazine</b> had significantly fewer lymphocytes in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The data suggest that <b>trifluoperazine</b> reduced the acute inflammation which accompanies bleomycin pneumotoxicity but did not affect the subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis.

40|$|Glutamate {{receptor}} activation {{has been}} previously shown to result in mitochondrial depolarization and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in cultured neurones. In this study, we characterized the effects of two putative permeability transition inhibitors, namely <b>trifluoperazine</b> and dibucaine, on mitochondrial depolarization in rat intact, cultured forebrain neurones. Permeability transition was monitored by following mitochondrial depolarization in neurones loaded with the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent indicator, JC- 1. <b>Trifluoperazine</b> (10 – 20 [*]μM) and dibucaine (50 – 100 [*]μM) inhibited or delayed the onset of glutamate-induced permeability transition. We also investigated the effects of <b>trifluoperazine</b> and dibucaine on neuronal recovery from glutamate-induced Ca 2 + loads. <b>Trifluoperazine</b> affected Ca 2 + recovery {{in a manner similar}} to the mitochondrial Na+/Ca 2 + exchange inhibitor, CGP- 37157, while dibucaine had no apparent effect on Ca 2 + recovery. Therefore, inhibition of permeability transition does not appear to be involved in Ca 2 + recovery from glutamate-induced Ca 2 + loads. <b>Trifluoperazine</b> and dibucaine did not inhibit [3 H]-dizocilpine binding at the concentrations that prevented mitochondrial depolarization. These studies suggest that <b>trifluoperazine</b> and dibucaine inhibit permeability transition in intact neurones. <b>Trifluoperazine</b> also appears to inhibit mitochondrial Na+/Ca 2 + exchange.

40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} phenothiazines (<b>trifluoperazine</b> and chlorpromazine) on cholesteryl ester {{metabolism}} {{has been investigated}} in J 774 mouse monocyte-macrophages. The incorporation of oleic acid into cholesteryl ester and the activity of acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol-O-acyltransferase were strongly decreased in cells pretreated for 24 h with <b>trifluoperazine</b> or chlorpromazine. Furthermore, <b>trifluoperazine</b> or chlorpromazine decreased the degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein by J 774 cells. When cell homogenates were preincubated in vitro with <b>trifluoperazine</b> or chlorpromazine, a marked inhibition of acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol-O-acyltransferase activity was observed. In cells incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein loaded with radiolabeled cholesteryl-linoleate, <b>trifluoperazine</b> and chlorpromazine dramatically reduced the radioactivity recovered in cholesteryl esters. The radioactivity recovered in free cholesterol was also decreased, but to a lesser extent. These results suggest that phenothiazines could efficiently antagonize cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages by at least two different mechanisms: a reduction of modified LDL catabolism, and a direct inhibition of the enzyme acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol-O-acyltransferase...|$|E
