The {{study also found that}} market participation was inadequate as a result of endogenous and exogenous conditional probabilistic reasons. Efficient <b>trading</b> <b>margins</b> and effective credit availability positions were not realized. Price discreteness had a negative impact on returns, as trading prices and credit availability in each of the trading hours were inversely related. Trading risks, and hence losses, were not minimized by hedging positions. The monopoly power in the Nifty market was 8.9526. Given this monopoly power, returns were less elastic with respect to the existing <b>trading</b> <b>margins,</b> financial resources, and market microstructure (price discreteness) that were available for reinvestment. Therefore, before investing in derivatives (index futures), market investors should evaluate <b>trading</b> <b>margins,</b> credit availability positions, and price discreteness.

Consequently, the distributive margin is a typical issue of National Accounts, where the trade service is quantified by the differences between the value of the sales and the value of purchases of goods for resale. In this paper we describe the principal steps of the procedure for the construction of this matrix for Italy. The proposed methodology is founded on the business statistics approach and tries to answer to the question “who sell what and to whom?”. The data collected from the enterprises, at a very detailed level of classification, provide a good representation of the “distributive channels ” (e. g. supermarkets, traditional grocery stores) but it needed an integration with information related to the economic destination of products (householders, enterprises, etc.) and to the different products sold by each commercial firm.

Two separate models are established to analyse (i) {{the interaction between}} agricultural technology and aggregate marketing margins in a Vietnamese context, and (ii) {{the relative importance of}} <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> and transportation margins in explaining the importance of aggregate margins. The results show that a reduction in marketing margins is not a necessary complement for agricultural technology improvements to target welfare gains for rural households. Nevertheless, it remains a desirable complement since (i) it will allow for the reaping of significant synergy gains from interaction with agricultural productivity growth, and (ii) it will increase the targeting potential of agricultural productivity growth in terms of welfare improvements for poor rural households. Finally, the results show that a reduction in <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> is a very potent instrument for reaping of synergy effects and targeting of rural household welfare.

Using a gravity equation approach, we analyze how the decrease in tariffs promoted during the 1990 s by the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement affected the <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> of French firms across 57 sectors and in 147 countries, from 1993 to 2002. Our main contribution is to estimate the elasticity of trade for both margins, controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity of trade flows thanks to a three-dimensional panel and to time-varying tariffs {{as a measure of}} variable trade costs. Our results show that the number of firms exporting in a given sector to a given destination is related to the level of tariffs. But they also show that the decrease in tariffs determined by the implementation of the Uruguay Round did not lead more firms to export and instead, only encouraged incumbent exporters to increase their shipments. We control for two problems that may affect our basic specification: tariff changes may be endogenous and zero flows are not included. Our results are confirmed - even when the extensive margin is significant, its contribution is very small. tariffs, <b>trade</b> <b>margins,</b> Uruguay Round...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, food markets have {{experienced}} high {{media coverage of}} food outbreaks, which have created incentive {{for a change in}} consumer behaviour (Verbeke, 2005). For instance, in Europe, food outbreaks in beef industry have lead to the lost in consumer confidence in food safety and quality (Roosen, et al., 2003). Taking this into account, governments have changed the regulatory framework for food traceability. Food traceability is defined as the ability to trace and follow food, feed and ingredients through the supply chain, including production, processing and distributions stages (EC/ 178, 2002).

40|$|The present paper aims to {{determine}} the effects of different levels of economic integration on the intensive and the extensive margins of trade. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the case of Latin America. It is of great importance for development policies in the region since the extensive margin can be defined as those exports that provide new market entrants, while the intensive margin is due to continued growth in sales of old exporters to the same destinations. Therefore, obtained results have important policy implications related to diversification strategies. The long-term period considered will allow us {{to determine}} whether different effects on <b>trade</b> <b>margins</b> might arise in the following two sub-periods: 1962 ~ 1989 and from 1990 onwards, i. e. before and after the spread of regional integration agreements and the deepening of the liberalization process in the region.

The obtained results show that the effect of economic integration is both time and period sensitive.
