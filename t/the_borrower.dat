5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. <b>The</b> <b>borrower</b> may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E

25|$|In the {{traditional}} retail model, borrowers visit a payday lending store and secure a small cash loan, with payment due in full at the borrower's next paycheck. <b>The</b> <b>borrower</b> writes a postdated {{check to the}} lender in the full amount of the loan plus fees.

5000|$|Lenders {{typically}} require {{access to}} <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> credit report before issuing a loan in <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> name.

Hence, credit freezing should reduce the risk that loans or credit cards will be issued fraudulently.

25|$|Thus a bond {{is a form}} of loan or IOU: {{the holder}} of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> (debtor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds provide <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> with {{external}} funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Borrowers</b> is a children's fantasy {{novel by}} the English author Mary Norton, {{published}} by Dent in 1952.

40|$|The author finds {{evidence}} that {{lines of credit}} secured by accounts receivable are associated with business borrowers with {{a high risk of}} default. While an unsecured short-term loan is repaid from <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> future cash flow, a loan secured by accounts receivable (a unique form of"inside"collateral) is repaid from previously generated and observed sales (<b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> trade credit terms to its customers). Consequently, lenders that secure accounts receivable are most concerned with the credit risk of <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> customers and <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> ability to continue to generate new sales. A stylizedtheoretical model demonstrates that the value of a secured line-of-credit loan in minimizing contracting costs is associated with <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> business risk and the quality of <b>the</b> <b>borrower's</b> customers. Empirical tests on a sample of publicly traded U. S. manufacturing firms find that firms with secured line of credit loans are observably riskier and have fewer expected growth opportunities. The author's findings suggest that observably riskier borrowers can borrow more on a secured than on an unsecured basis. The results highlight the important role of secured letters of credit in providing liquidity to risky, credit-constrained firms that might not have access to external financing through other channels.

25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't {{have enough money}} in their account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are {{prohibited}} from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> for writing a hot check.|$|E
25|$|Any loan that {{is allowed}} to {{generate}} negative amortization means that <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> is reducing his equity in his home, which increases the chance that he won't {{be able to sell}} it for enough to repay the loan. Declining property values would exacerbate this risk.|$|E
