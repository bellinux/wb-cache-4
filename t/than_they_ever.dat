5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors {{got to know each other}} better <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had.|$|E

25|$|Soon the Balkan rebellions were {{beginning}} to falter. In Europe, papers were filled with reports of Ottoman soldiers killing thousands of Slavs. Even in Great Britain William Ewart Gladstone published his account of Ottoman atrocities in his Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Soon, a new Russo-Turkish war had begun. Despite fighting better <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had before, the advanced Ottoman armies still were not equal to the Russian forces. This time there was no help from abroad, in truth many European nations supported the Russian war, {{as long as it}} did not get too close to Istanbul. Ten and a half months later when the war had ended the age of Ottoman domination over the Balkans was over. The Ottomans had fought well, the new navy of Ironclads had won the battle for the Black Sea, and Russian advances in the Caucasus had been kept minimal. In the Balkans, however, the Russian army, supported by rebels, had pushed the Ottoman army out of Bulgaria, Romania, and much of East Rumelia {{and by the end of}} the war the artillery firing in Thrace could be heard in Constantinople.|$|E

500|$|AI {{researchers}} {{began to}} develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had in the past. There was a widespread realization {{that many of the}} problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like mathematics, economics or operations research. The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous [...] "scientific" [...] discipline. [...] describe this as nothing less than a [...] "revolution" [...] and [...] "the victory of the neats".|$|E
500|$|In January 1996, {{the song}} was issued as the B-side to [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] on a blue-vinyl jukebox single, {{as part of a}} series of Beatles {{releases}} by Capitol Records' CEMA Special Markets division. By 1999, [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] remained one of only two post-1963 Beatles songs not to have been made available in true stereo (the other being [...] "You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)"). That year, a stereo version became available when the track was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack, which accompanied the re-release of the animated film. Harrison said that the 1999 reissue was timely, given that the Blue Meanies [...] "have got a bigger stranglehold on the planet right now <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had back in 1967!", adding that [...] "even the music industry has turned grey and is dominated by Blue Meanies." ...|$|E
500|$|The strip {{followed}} {{the structure of}} the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something more exciting than the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. [...] "Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> did in more mundane settings." [...] The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle-Eastern state, offered him £1million to coach the national team.|$|E

500|$|After {{the already}} tense {{relations}} between ZANU–PF and ZAPU disintegrated amid Mugabe's wish {{to adopt a}} one-party system in Zimbabwe, Mugabe expelled Nkomo from the government in February 1982, accusing him and ZAPU of plotting a coup. About a year later, Mugabe deployed the North Korean-trained 5Brigade to Matabeleland, ZAPU's heartland, where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting [...] "dissidents" [...] in what became called Gukurahundi. Meredith asserts that this far exceeded anything that had occurred during the Bush War, an opinion shared by Geoff Hill. Some white farmers were also killed. Estimates {{for the number of}} deaths during the five-year Gukurahundi campaign range from 10,000 to 30,000. Mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise the other main black nationalist leaders from the Chimurenga. Nkomo fled to the UK in March 1983, fearing for his life; Sithole similarly exiled himself in the United States. Muzorewa stayed in Zimbabwe and was detained in late 1983 for alleged [...] "subversive links" [...] with South Africa. On arriving in England, Nkomo accused Mugabe of genocide and asserted that [...] "Things are worse now <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> were under Ian Smith". Mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to the contrary down to [...] "reactionary foreign journalists".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{approved}} of the episode, telling Us Weekly that she found it [...] "brilliant on every level", praising the scripting and the message of equality. The episode also received positive reviews from critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "one of the best hours of TV you’re likely to see all year", writing that the episode pays Madonna [...] "the highest compliment possible" [...] in not just expressing admiration for the singer, but [...] "demonstrat a potent understanding of why Madonna matters." [...] Fellow Entertainment Weekly writer Tim Stack deemed it the best episode of Glee thus far, grading each of the songs performed [...] "B+" [...] through to [...] "A+". Stack felt that the episode {{lived up to its}} hype, an opinion concurred with by Aly Semigran of MTV, who also deemed [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] the show's best episode to date. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle went further in his praise, calling [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] potentially [...] "the most-enjoyable hour of television of all time." [...] Kevin Coll of Fused Film felt that the episode redeemed the series following its [...] "dismal comeback" [...] with [...] "Hell-O", calling it [...] "a great story that explored the characters of Glee in much better depth <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> have." ...|$|E
500|$|The OF Tape Vol. 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pitchforks Jordan Sargent {{stated that the}} album was mostly a success because [...] "every member steps up", with Domo who had [...] "evolved from the group's bumbling stoner into {{a guy who can}} spit dizzying, complicated verses". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stated that the album contained a [...] "fizzy energy that elevates it above its limitations", musing that Odd Future were a lot like [...] "early Wu-Tang, a thrilling regional act, and a bunch of whip-smart black hipsters whose worldview is grounded in their corner of sun-baked [...] southern California." [...] PopMatters's Jeff Dunn felt that every member improved from their past mixtapes, stating that Ocean, Tyler, and Sweatshirt were all impressive, consistently [...] "spitting dizzying, more original lines <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> have on mixtapes past." [...] Dunn wrote that [...] "after the mixed returns of Goblin, Tyler himself now seems to realize that less is more on his part", who [...] "wisely tones down the shock-for-shock’s-sake rhymes quite a bit, making his appearances all the more rewarding when they do occur." [...] Steve Labate of Paste mused that [...] "while Odd Future’s critics try hard to frame them as such, it’s difficult to accept Tyler and the OF crew as mere shock artists, flippantly tossing off incendiary slurs for attention—the music is too tongue-in-cheek clever, too brainy and self-aware, too anything-goes eccentric." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{subscription}} {{was raised}} for the widow {{and children of}} Bellingham, and [...] "their fortune was ten times greater <b>than</b> <b>they</b> could <b>ever</b> have expected in any other circumstances". His widow remarried the following year.|$|R

2500|$|The boom in rail {{transport}} in Britain during the 1840s meant {{that people were}} able to travel further and with less inconvenience <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, {{it was difficult for}} schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host [...] "home" [...] school, and the other half by the visiting [...] "away" [...] school.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, with {{overseas}} players now permitted, Essex {{were able}} to gradually strengthen their team to achieve much more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had before. This decade saw the advent of Graham Gooch, one of England's finest opening batsmen, even though he began his Test career with a [...] against Australia in 1975. He didn't return to the England team until 1978, but after a slow start began to assert his dominance over Test bowlers as he had on the county scene. Dedicated to training, he forced his burly physique through a tough regime to prolong his career long after some of his contemporaries had retired.|$|E
60|$|And so, in the end, {{they all}} got back their self-respect; yes, and even added {{somewhat}} to it; indeed when the sitting broke up they had a finer opinion of themselves <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had <b>ever</b> had before.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s, {{the science}} of {{conditioning}} and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had <b>ever</b> been.|$|R

2500|$|... "El realismo magical", magic realism, {{at least}} as practised by Márquez, is a {{development}} out of Surrealism that expresses a genuinely [...] "Third World" [...] consciousness. It deals with what Naipaul has called [...] "half-made" [...] societies, in which the impossibly old struggles against the appallingly new, in which public corruptions and private anguishes are somehow more garish and extreme <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> get in the so-called [...] "North", where centuries of wealth and power have formed thick layers {{over the surface of}} what's really going on. In the works of Márquez, as in the world he describes, impossible things happen constantly, and quite plausibly, out in the open under the midday sun.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1995, the Fox network {{decided not}} to pick up its option for more episodes of the show, despite {{receiving}} more letters and mail <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> had for any show. By January 1997, the BBC had raised all of the necessary money for an eight-episode long third season of TV Nation, receiving funds from TV networks in five different countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France). What prevented the third season from becoming a reality {{was a lack of}} a major American television network outlet for the show. During this time reruns of the show began appearing on Comedy Central, and ratings for the first week were, in Moore's words, [...] "incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews {{were mainly}} positive, praising the band for the album's {{progression}} and originality {{in the midst}} of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, [...] "It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them". In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Hexagram", the album's opener, [...] "hits hard—harder <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is". He also went on to say, however, that the album [...] "sticks a little too close to familiar territory". The A.V. Club similarly called the album [...] "less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre".|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{pray that}} we may all be spared," [...] {{answered}} Dora, and they did pray, more earnestly <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had <b>ever</b> before prayed in their whole lives. It was a moment that put their faith to a supreme test.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, the Liberals won 17 of the 36 {{predominantly}} anglophone ridings, {{their best}} showing {{in a competitive}} election in English New Brunswick since the 1944 election.

2500|$|When again nothing took place, {{predictions}} regressed {{to their}} earlier short-term orientation.

The human mind seems to have a natural tendency, and one with which we should have sympathy, to expect matters to culminate more rapidly, fulfillments to come more suddenly, <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> do come ... Studying God's Word, we have measured the 2520 years, the Seven symbolic Times, from that year 606 B.C. and have found that it reached down to October, 1914, as nearly as we were able to reckon. We did not say positively that this would be the year. We merely left every one to look at the facts of history and reckon for himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Grey Griffins series {{follows the}} story of four sixth graders {{who live in the}} fictional city of Avalon, Minnesota. These four friends formed a secret order named The Order of the Grey Griffins, {{consisting}} of, Grayson Maximillian [...] "Max" [...] Sumner III (the leader) and his friends: Natalia Romanov (the marshal), Ernie Tweeny (the steward), and Harley Eisenstein (the warden). In The Revenge of the Shadow King, the Grey Griffins discover a link between their 'innocent' card game (Round Table) and a magic book (the Codex Spiritus) which Max discovers in his grandmother's attic. The story focuses on the friendship between the four 'Griffins', and their adventures as they stumble upon one dark secret after another and soon learn that the world in which they lived was much more dangerous <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> believed. With the help of the Knights Templar (a shadowy organization that protects humanity from the monsters and abuses of faerie magic), the Griffins uncover a plot to hand the earth over to the malevolent Shadow King.|$|E
2500|$|Nintendo {{was not as}} {{restrictive}} as Sega, {{which did}} not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988. Nintendo's intention was to reserve {{a large part of}} NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that it be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory {{at the end of the}} NES era <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo's [...] "iron-clad terms" [...] made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami's Ultra Games label; others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.|$|E
