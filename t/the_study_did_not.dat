5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not come to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E

25|$|One large {{industry}} survey, from 2004, {{found that}} roughly 13% {{of those who}} applied for individual health insurance were denied coverage after undergoing medical underwriting. Declination rates increased significantly with age, rising from 5% for individuals 18 and under to just under a third for individuals to 64. The same study found that among those who received offers for coverage, 76% received offers at standard rates 22% were quoted higher rates. The frequency of increased premiums also increased with age so for applicants over 40, roughly half were affected by medical underwriting, either {{in the form of}} denial or increased premiums. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> address how many applicants offered coverage at higher premiums decided to decline the policy. A study conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in 2001 found that, among those 19 to 64 who sought individual health insurance during the previous three years, the majority found it expensive, and less than a third ended up purchasing insurance. However, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> distinguish between consumers who were quoted increased rates by medical underwriting and those who qualified for standard or preferred premiums.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{study of}} California data {{found that the}} {{reported}} incidence of autism rose 7- to 8-fold from the early 1990s to 2007, and that changes in diagnostic criteria, inclusion of milder cases, and earlier age of diagnosis probably explain only a 4.25-fold increase; <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> quantify the effects of wider awareness of autism, increased funding, and expanding treatment options resulting in parents' greater motivation to seek services.

25|$|In 2017, a study {{compared}} the nuclear genome sequences of three Neolithic dog specimens from Germany and Ireland with sequences from over 5,000 dogs and wolves.

The study found that a single dog-wolf divergence occurred 36,900-41,500 YBP, followed by a divergence between Southeast Asian and Western Eurasian dogs 17,500-23,900 YBP and this indicates a single dog domestication event occurring between 20,000-40,000 YBP. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support a dual domestication event found by an earlier study.|$|E
25|$|The study {{concluded}} that the prisoners who graduated from the program had a recidivism rate of 8 percent. The study's control group had a recidivism rate of 20%.

25|$|The {{study was}} criticized by {{geneticist}} Doron Behar, who stated {{that while the}} Mt-DNA of Ashkenazi Jews is of mixed Middle Eastern and European origins, the deepest maternal roots of Ashkenazi Jews are not European. Harry Ostrer said Richards' study seemed reasonable, and corresponded to the known facts of Jewish history. Karl Skorecki of the Rambam Health Care Campus stated that there were serious flaws of phylogenetic analysis. Both Behar and Skorecki claim that the Mt-DNA used in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> represent {{the full spectrum of}} mitochondrial diversity. Eran Elhaik, a geneticist at the University of Sheffield, argues that the evidence ruled out a Near Eastern origin for many Ashkenazi mitochondrial lineages but he challenged the conclusion that a Khazarian contribution is absent.|$|E

25|$|A {{seemingly}} paradoxical role of AMPK {{occurs when}} we {{take a closer look}} at the energy-sensing enzyme in relation to exercise and long-term training. Similar to short-term acute training scale, long-term endurance training studies also reveal increases in oxidative metabolic enzymes, GLUT-4, mitochondrial size and quantity, and an increased dependency on the oxidation of fatty acids; however, Winder et al. reported in 2002 that despite observing these increased oxidative biochemical adaptations to long-term endurance training (similar to those mentioned above), the AMPK response (activation of AMPK with the onset of exercise) to acute bouts of exercise decreased in red quadriceps (RQ) with training (3 – see Fig.1). Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> observe the same results in white quadriceps (WQ) and soleus (SOL) muscles that they did in RQ. The trained rats used for that endurance study ran on treadmills 5 days/wk in two 1-h sessions, morning and afternoon. The rats were also running up to 31m/min (grade 15%). Finally, following training, the rats were sacrificed either at rest or following 10 min. of exercise.|$|E
25|$|The ABCC grew {{rapidly in}} 1948 and 1949. Their staff numbers quadrupled {{in just one}} year. By 1951 the total stood at 1063 {{employees}} – 143 allied and 920 Japanese personnel. Perhaps the most important research undertaken by the ABCC was the genetics study, which focused its study on the uncertainties surrounding the possible long-term effects of ionizing radiation in pregnant women and their unborn children. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find evidence of widespread genetic damage. It did, however, find increased incidence of microcephaly and mental retardation in children most proximally exposed in utero to the bombs' radiation. The genetics project studied the effects of radiation on the survivors and their children. This project {{turned out to be}} the largest and most interactive of the ABCC programs. In 1957, Japan passed the Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law, which qualified certain people for two medical exams per year. The Japanese term for the survivors of the atomic bombs is hibakusha. The qualifications for medical care were those within a few kilometers of the hypocenters at the time of the bombings; those within 2 kilometers of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; those exposed to radiation from fallout and children who were in utero by women who fit into any of the other categories.|$|E

Local residents distributed 2,000fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway. The South Belt Local Advisory Board criticized BKI's 110-page study report as [...] "filled with errors"; the consultants' earlier 26-page [...] paper had been rejected by the board and MDOT as [...] "unusable". An editorial in The Grand Rapids Press stated that <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> help advance the project in the area, instead opening the proposed freeway up to new controversies.

500|$|There {{are parts}} of Central Eurasia where the {{environment}} {{is considered to be}} stable over the past 40,000 years. In 2016 a study compared mDNA sequences of ancient wolf specimens with those from modern wolves, including specimens from the remote regions of North America, Russia, and China. One ancient haplotype that had once existed in both Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000YBP) and Russia (Medvezya [...] "Bear" [...] Cave, Pechora area, Northern Urals 18,000YBP) was shared by modern wolves found living in Mongolia and China (indicating a common maternal ancestor). The study found that the genetic diversity of past wolves was lost {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe, and that there is limited overlap with modern wolves. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support two wolf haplogroups that had been proposed by earlier studies. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model indicated by other studies, this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck (reduction) in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost at the beginning of the Holocene. In Eurasia, the loss of many ancient lineages cannot be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with reasons unclear.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to general skepticism among gynecologists, sexologists {{and other researchers}} that the G-spot exists, a team at King's College London in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective. They acquired the largest sample size of women to date – 1,800 – who are pairs of twins, {{and found that the}} twins did not report a similar G-spot in their questionnaires. The research, headed by Tim Spector, documents a 15-year study of the twins, identical and non-identical. Identical twins share genes, while non-identical pairs share 50% of theirs. According to the researchers, if one identical twin reported having a G-spot, it was more likely that the other would too, but this pattern did not materialize. Study co-author Andrea Burri believes: [...] "It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too." [...] She stated {{that one of the reasons}} for the research was to remove feelings of [...] "inadequacy or underachievement" [...] for women who feared they lacked a G-spot. Researcher Beverly Whipple dismissed the findings, commenting that twins have different sexual partners and techniques, and that <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> properly account for lesbian or bisexual women.|$|E
