40|$|This study {{argues that}} {{learning}} of varying control mappings in digitally extended voice works imbues body and memory into liveness. The author built {{and uses the}} Abacus, a unique, microphone-mounted, Arduino-based musical interface, to control granulation of live vocal samples. There are sixteen pre-composed mappings of Abacus control data (eight toggle switches) to granulation parameters, and mapping changes regularly. An animated screen score provides manual <b>toggle</b> <b>control</b> instructions, which didactically supply information on current mapping. The author's practice is related to other composer-vocalists' works for digitally extended voice and to a larger context of screen scores and musical games. Extended voice treats vocal presence as body-technology intersection, and screen scores and musical games highlight embodied learning using unchanging control mappings. The author's work unites these realms, arguing that repeated, notation-driven learning of the action-sound relationship thematizes complex interactions between body, temporality, memory, and presence...|$|E
40|$|The design, {{construction}} {{and testing of}} a reverse-osmosis (PV-RO) desalination system for fresh water shortage area is presented. The system operates from salt water or brackish water and can be embedded in a renewable energy power supply system, since many fresh shortage areas are remote and isolated. Special attention {{is given to the}} energy efficiency of small-scale reverse osmosis desalination systems. Limitations of conventional control strategy using <b>toggle</b> <b>control</b> are presented. Based on this, an objective of creating a small-scale reverse osmosis desalination system was set out. Initially, the background information is presented. This includes the natural resources crisis and main desalination technologies and the viability of the integration with renewable energy source. A reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system was assembled and set up at the Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia Supervisor Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system was built using a Human Machine Interface software and a programmable logic controller (PLC). Instrumentation that included signal conditioners was made in analysis of the system characteristics. Initial testing of the system was conducted after the system design and configuration was accomplished. Testing results were used as a guideline {{for the development of the}} whole system. Modelling and simulation of the system components in MATLABSimulink is presented, together with a discussion of the control systems modelling and design procedure, in which the aim was to improve the efficiency of the reverse osmosis system. Simulations show the designed reverse osmosis system with Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) controller has better performance than other controllers. This consequently leads to a lower overall cost of the water, as well as reducing full maintenance cost of the electric drives in the reverse osmosis unit. Additionally, the configuration of the remote control system through General Package Radio System (GPRS) network is depicted. After the PID control algorithm was programmed into the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), system experiments were carried out in short durations and long durations. System performance was monitored and experimental results prove that the new control strategy applied increase the water productivity and is able to improve the system efficiency up to 35 %. Based on the data obtained from the simulations and experiments, Mundoo Island was chosen to be the location for a case study. The electric load profile of the island was derived from the Island Development Committee in Mundoo. A water demand profile was created and modelled in Matlab to be the input of the reverse osmosis system. The electric load of the reverse osmosis system was generated from Matlab simulation. This result was entered in Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) simulator. Having the designed RO unit as one of the electric loads, the entire remote area power supply (RAPS) system was tested in simulations which shows the energy cost is AUS$ 0. 174 per kWh, lower than the Island Development Committee budget estimation of AUS$ 0. 25 per kWh. The cost of the water treatment is very promising at AUS$ 0. 77 per m 3...|$|E

50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be {{selected}} was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the <b>toggles</b> <b>controlling</b> the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for shaping pulses to control biological systems, and specifically systems in synthetic biology. By shaping we mean computing the magnitude {{and the length of}} a pulse, application of which results in reaching the desired control objective. Hence the control signals have only two parameters, which makes these signals amenable to wetlab implementations. We focus on the problem of switching between steady states in a bistable system. We show how to estimate the set of the switching pulses, if the trajectories of the controlled system can be bounded from above and below by the trajectories of monotone systems. We then generalise this result to systems with parametric uncertainty under some mild assumptions on the set of admissible parameters, thus providing some robustness guarantees. We illustrate the results on some example genetic circuits. Index Termsâ€”monotone systems, near-monotone systems, <b>toggle</b> switch, <b>control</b> by pulses, open-loop contro...|$|R

In vitro, aggregation is irreversible under physiological conditions. Remarkably, the cells of bacteria, plants, and fungi have evolved machinery to neatly extract polypeptide chains from large aggregates and refold them to the native state, with little specificity for protein sequence or fold (2 â€“ 4). Although the components of this machinery are well known, an understanding of how they accomplish disaggregation has been elusive. Several recent studies (5 â€“ 8), including one by Rosenzweig et al.
