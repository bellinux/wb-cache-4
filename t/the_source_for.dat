5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population.

These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E

5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> these eruptions.|$|E
50|$|Differences {{between the}} ERAN and the MMN also exist in <b>the</b> neural <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> main {{contributions}} to <b>the</b> ERPs. <b>The</b> <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ERAN {{are located in}} the pars opercularis of the inferior fronto-lateral cortex (inferior Brodmann's area with contributions from the ventrolateral premotor cortex and the anterior superior temporal gyrus, whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the primary auditory cortex with additional <b>sources</b> in <b>the</b> frontal cortical areas. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MMN {{are located in the}} temporal lobe. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a propofol sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations.|$|R

5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning.

5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere.

The Oort cloud, which is thought to be <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
