40|$|In real-life we {{interact}} with {{the world in a}} multisensory way. Nevertheless, research in cognitive neuroscience typically focuses on one separate sensory system. Further, complex natural tasks (e. g., mentalizing) engage not only a single system (e. g., visual) but instead several neural systems. We developed a naturalisitic multisensory mentalizing task for social perception, by asking participants “what do you <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of <b>people</b> <b>would</b> answer” when judging the congruency between vocal emotional responses to visual scenes having emotional content. For example, trials with negative-valence scenes coupled with negative-valence vocalizations were typically judged congruent, whereas with positive vocalizations in this case were assigned as incongruent. We thus avoided the ‘logical reasoning’ approach of the classical false-believe tasks. Here instead a “thin-slice perception” of social appropriateness was used to target mentalizing ‘at a glance’. The first results revealed: 1) low-level visual areas only cares about low-level visual features, even in this naturalisitic complex context. Interestingly, comparisons with V 1 models revealed that ‘real-life’ models (from independent V 1 data) outperformed theoretical ones, e. g., HMAX, deep learning (last layer). 2) Surprisingly, high-level visual areas spontaneously and strongly discriminate animate versus inanimate images, which was task-irrelevant. 3) Crucially, cross-modal valence congruency (i. e., social congruency) could be discriminated in medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, confirming their roles for mentalizing beyond logical reasoning. Finally, new acquiring data from autism population will shed new light in the controversial topic: at which level of the brain hierarchy their neural representations differ: at sensory level or only at higher cognitive levels (e. g., social cognition) ?status: accepte...|$|R
5000|$|The scene {{involving}} Owen violently attacking Denise prompted 128 {{complaints from}} viewers, who believed {{it should not}} have been shown before the 9 p.m. watershed. The programme's executive producer, Kate Harwood, defended the scene, saying, [...] "in tackling the issue of domestic violence, it was important to reflect realistically the sort of violence suffered by the victims in these sorts of situations, rather than to put a gloss on it. We therefore took great care to signal the nature of the episode's content in advance." [...] However, she acknowledged that some viewers would have found the scenes disturbing. Luton South MP Margaret Moran, a member of the all-party parliamentary group on domestic violence, insisted the storyline illustrates real life and may encourage victims to speak out and get help, saying, [...] "we can't hide these things away no matter what time of day it is. ... Even though this episode was shown before the watershed it will have had a real resonance with children, showing them that they are not alone and can get help. EastEnders will have put contact numbers {{at the end of the}} episode for people who are experiencing domestic violence to call. This is based on the guidelines for the BBC I helped to write." [...] Jeff Gardner of Victim Support Bedfordshire, also supported the storyline, saying [...] "Dealing with domestic violence is a very sensitive and difficult thing to do. EastEnders has a large audience and if they were to sensitively raise the issues of domestic violence in the home and how people can get support in relation to it, then I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> want to support that." ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} {{remarkable}} impacts of the Internet on our social lives has been its shaping of our language. A spontaneously evolving Internet-argot has relentlessly and conspicuously intruded itself into everyday life. The activities and circumstances of a people 2 ̆ 2 on-line 2 ̆ 2 are now described by an array of powerful and colorful metaphors that capture {{the spirit of a}} new, robust technology. We find ourselves often conversing casually and unselfconsciously in an idiom that would have been incomprehensible only a few short years ago. We do, indeed, talk differently now. One Internet-spawned expression that seems to have achieved common linguistic currency is the term 2 ̆ 2 digital divide 2 ̆ 2. Whenever this alliterative phrase is dropped, immediate concern is aroused, which, one suspects, is why it has caught on. It has become a frequently re-sorted to locution of information specialists, librarians, public policy-makers and even politicians. It gives expression to a current form of what I call 2 ̆ 2 sociological angst 2 ̆ 2, a fear that the digital technology that has brought so many rapid changes into the workplace, education and commerce may actually be changing the lives of large groups of people for the worse. 2 ̆ 2 Technologies 2 ̆ 2, as one technologist has recently noted, 2 ̆ 2 are not value-neutral but will have both beneficial and disadvantageous consequences for their increasing pervasiveness within society 2 ̆ 2. Perhaps this reflection merely states the obvious. The point is made, with more eloquence and with some added insight by another technologist: 2 ̆ 2 I <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> accept that all technology is a Faustian bargain, that it giveth and it taketh away, and that the verdict on the value of the giving and the adverse impact of the taking away often takes the jury, i. e. society, many years of observation and discovery before it can be delivered with any accuracy 2 ̆ 2.

5000|$|Intersectional theory {{creates a}} unified idea of anti-oppression {{politics}} {{that requires a}} lot out of its adherents, often more than can reasonably be expected, creating difficulties achieving praxis. Intersectional philosophy encourages focusing on the issues inside the group instead of on society at large. Intersectionality is [...] "a call to complexity and to abandon over simplification. However, this has the parallel effect of emphasizing 'internal differences' over hegemonic structures." [...] In emphasizing internal differences over hegemonic structures, and having complex and at times contradictory recommendations, it can create paralyses because the bar to entry is so high. [...] "People are not perfect, and they do not have unlimited time and resources. I've given the example of disability, because I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> agree that obviously, any public meeting should be accessible to wheelchairs. But what about the deaf? The blind? Should a group of feminists starting their own meet-up in a university hall enlist someone proficient a sign-language in case that's needed? Should they print their leaflets in braille?" [...] This also complicates building alliances, because imperfect humans cannot live up the standard intersectionality promotes, and may stop attempting intersectionality for this reason, an affect that can create a broader political problem building intersectional alliances or mass movements.|$|E
40|$|After the botched 2014 {{execution}} of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma, John Oliver tackled {{the issue of}} the death penalty on the second episode of his HBO show, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.

Since 1973, there have been 157 death row exonerations. That is approximately one exoneration for every ten executionsin this country. Recent research suggests that the rate of wrongful convictions in capital cases where a death sentence was imposed is approximately four percent, which means that approximately 120 of the roughly 3, 000 inmates on death row in this country are not guilty.
