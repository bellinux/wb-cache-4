5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at <b>the</b> <b>waistband,</b> with no fabric {{on the side of}} the legs.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Utilitarian or {{very casual}} styles such as jeans and cargo pants are flat-front (without pleats at <b>the</b> <b>waistband)</b> but may have bellows pockets.|$|E
50|$|Boxer shorts, boxers, or trunks have an elasticated {{waistband}} {{that is at}} or {{near the}} wearer's waist, while the groin sections are fairly loose and extend to the mid-thigh. There is usually a fly, either with or without buttons. <b>The</b> <b>waistbands</b> of boxer shorts are usually wider than those of briefs, and often bear the brand name of the manufacturer.|$|R

5000|$|Since the 1980s {{and more}} {{commonly}} in the mid-1990s, {{the practice of}} sagging the pants, in which <b>the</b> <b>waistbands</b> (usually secured by a cinched belt) of trousers or (typically long) shorts are worn at or below the hips, thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment, has been seen among young men and boys, especially {{among those who are}} consanguine with hip-hop culture and fashion. This practice is sometimes (incorrectly) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison (due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide) -- historically, including {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century, gang-affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their belts fastened tightly.|$|R
25|$|At present, most {{trousers}} {{are held}} {{up through the}} assistance of a belt which is passed through the belt loops on <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> of the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of braces (suspenders in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective and more comfortable because it requires no cinching of the waist or periodic adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Pleats {{just below}} <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> {{on the front}} typify many styles of formal and casual trousers, {{including}} suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called reverse pleats (typical of most trousers today) and when they open toward the fly they are known as forward pleats.|$|E

25|$|Alternatives to jockstraps {{include the}} jock brief, or support briefs, {{which have the}} wide {{waistband}} of a jockstrap combined with a full seat and are made of an elastic supportive material. A thong style strap, sometimes called a dance belt, has one narrow elastic strap attached {{to the bottom of}} the pouch, passing between the legs and attaching to <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> at the middle of the back. A strapless garment, called a jock sock or sometimes a slingshot, has only an elastic waist band with an elastic pouch that holds the genitals from the front.|$|E
25|$|Knot: Some of {{the most}} common knots are the Four-in-hand, the Half-Windsor, the Windsor (often called a Full-Windsor or Double-Windsor to {{distinguish}} it from the half-Windsor) and the Shelby or Pratt. A Four-in-hand, Half-Windsor, or Windsor is generally the most appropriate with a suit, particularly by contemporary guidelines. Once properly knotted and arranged, the bottom of the tie can extend anywhere from the wearer's navel level, to slightly below <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> The thin end should not extend below the wide end, though this can occasionally be seen to be acceptable with thin ties.|$|E
25|$|In March a new U.S. Army {{combat uniform}} {{that takes into}} {{consideration}} fit requirements of female soldiers (the Army Combat Uniform-Alternate, known as ACU-A) was approved for use by both men and women. The new uniform is wider in the hips and backside and has elastic around <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> instead of a draw string, as well as adjusted pockets and elbow-pad and knee-pad inserts and shortened crotch length. The rank and name plate were also repositioned on the uniform jacket. The new uniform also has slimmer shoulders, a longer coat, and buttons that replace the Velcro pockets.|$|E
5000|$|The Madonna wannabe {{trend was}} at its peak from 1984 until 1986. During that time, it was common to see young women across the world dressed in the style {{affected}} by pop star Madonna in that era: a thrift shop look that incorporated many beads, lace tops, bleached hair, rosaries, crucifixes, skirts, bracelets and bustiers. Sometimes the wannabes wore men's boxer shorts outside their clothes. Skow commented on the phenomenon:"The bright side of this trend is that these Wanna Be's (as in [...] "We wanna be like Madonna!") could be out somewhere stealing hubcaps. Instead, all of them, {{hundreds of thousands of}} young blossoms whose actual ages run from a low of about eight to a high of perhaps 25, are saving up their baby-sitting money to buy cross-shaped earrings and fluorescent rubber bracelets like Madonna's, white lace tights that they will cut off at the ankles and black tube skirts that, out of view of their parents, they will roll down several turns at the waist to expose their middles and <b>the</b> <b>waistbands</b> of <b>the</b> pantyhose." ...|$|R

25|$|A jockstrap (also {{known as}} a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or {{athletic}} supporter) is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling, contact sports or other vigorous physical activity. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed {{to the base of}} the pouch and to the left and right sides of <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> at the hip. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an abdominal guard (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the testicles and the penis from injury.|$|E
25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> of the petticoat. They create a graceful, {{decorative}} effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E
25|$|Other {{variations}} in trouser style include {{the rise of}} the trouser. This was very high in the early half of the 20th century, particularly with formalwear, with rises above the natural waist, to allow the waistcoat covering <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> to come down just below the narrowest point of the chest. Though serving less purpose, this high height was duplicated in the daywear of the period. Since then, fashions have changed, and have rarely been that high again with styles returning more to low-rise trousers, even dropping down to have waistbands resting on the hips. Other changing aspects of the cut include the length, which determines the break, the bunching of fabric just above the shoe when the front seam is marginally longer than height to the shoe's top. Some parts of the world, such as Europe, traditionally opt for shorter trousers with little or no break, while Americans often choose to wear a slight break.|$|E
50|$|Shah Ghazi's {{coronation}} {{was most}} likely done in traditional Bavandid fashion. In accordance with the ancient Iranian style, the coronation lasted seven days, and included the typical banquets, exhilarations, giving of gifts, whilst the renowned statesmen, local rulers, {{and members of the}} royal house gathered from all the landscapes. On the eight day, after the felicitations were complete, Shah Ghazi ascended the throne, fastened <b>the</b> royal <b>waistband,</b> and confirmed <b>the</b> governors in their offices.|$|R
50|$|The bottom {{are simple}} {{trousers}} typically of an elastic band in later times, more traditionally a buttoned waistband or pull-string <b>waistband.</b> <b>The</b> trunks are loose and flowing {{with a small}} amount of flaring but can also be cut straight.|$|R

25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which sealed on the chest and thighs.|$|E
500|$|For the 2017–18 season, the Blazers {{made some}} slight {{revisions}} to their iconic look, changing the {{alignment of the}} city and team name from italicized to straight while adding the 'Rip City' nickname on <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> [...] They also changed their red alternate uniform to include a black and grey variation of the [...] "blaze" [...] strip inspired from the team's pinwheel logo and a lack of white elements.|$|E
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E
5000|$|As the gaucho {{was never}} far from the horse, the rebenque was always on him. When not in use, he made a knot with the strap and held the rebenque lazily by the wrist strap with the middle fingers of his hand, or hung it from the handle of his facón knife (as he used the large knife almost {{horizontally}} at his back, held by <b>the</b> belt or <b>waistband,</b> <b>the</b> handle protruded from his right side). The rebenque was used also for fighting, as a weapon by itself, when the fight did not merit a knife, or with the strap rolled on {{his left hand and}} the handle hanging, as a secondary weapon to the knife in his right hand.|$|R
50|$|In 1912, the old style pointed pocket flaps were to {{have three}} buttons (one under each point). The {{waistcoat}} has pointed pocket flaps and three buttons under each, skirted fronts. The sword is of sling type, with slings instead of a frog on <b>the</b> black silk <b>waistband.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{ornaments}} worn by Hindu {{women are}} sometimes known as solah singar (sixteen decorations): [...] "bindi, necklaces, earrings, {{flowers in the}} hair, rings, bangles, armlets (for <b>the</b> upper arm), <b>waistbands,</b> ankle-bells, kohl (or kajal - mascara), toe rings, henna, perfume, sandalwood paste, the upper garment, and the lower garment".|$|R
500|$|From 1978 to 1986, {{the team}} wore {{pullover}} v-neck jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, gray, for road games, and red or blue, {{for use as}} alternates. Bands of red, white, and blue were worn around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings (the blue jerseys had one white band and two red bands). The word [...] "Sounds" [...] was written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script. Numbers, but not names, were sewn {{on the back of}} jerseys. The team's pants were white and also displayed small red, white, and blue stripes down the legs and larger stripes around <b>the</b> <b>waistband.</b> Similar gray pants were worn for road games. Beginning in 1984, numbers were also located on the front of jerseys on the player's left chest, below the team name. The team wore a blue cap with a red brim, displaying an [...] "N" [...] styled like a music note in white, bordered by red; this was the official team cap from 1978 through the mid-1990s.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "11001001" [...] is {{a binary}} number, a {{contraction}} {{of the names}} of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called [...] "10101001". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to [...] "The Big Goodbye", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus {{on the side of the}} headpiece through a battery pack attached to <b>the</b> <b>waistband</b> of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors {{unveiled}} {{four new}} uniforms. The uniforms were released {{in partnership with}} 2K Sports' NBA 2K16 video game. The team said in a press release the new uniform designs were intended {{to pay tribute to}} the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of [...] "We The North". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's [...] "We The North" [...] slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of <b>the</b> <b>waistband,</b> and the letter [...] "T" [...] is now {{on the sides of the}} shorts, with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [...] "T-Dot" [...] nickname.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} of the fact, for, besides the relief {{experienced}} by the boy, from the relaxing of her grip on his <b>waistband</b> <b>the</b> moment the wail was heard, {{the sound of the}} girl's footsteps as she flew back towards the entrance of the cave was distinctly heard.|$|R
50|$|Each {{individual}} undergarment {{started out}} as a pair of either plain white briefs or plain white panties until the desired prints are added in the manufacturing process. Differences found between the male and female undergarments included the fly in the boys' underwear (for easier urination) and <b>the</b> feminine <b>waistband</b> in <b>the</b> girls' underwear (emulating that of women's full cut panties). The softness of the cotton fabric used could have also determined whether the undergarment was to be worn by a male child or a female child when outside of its original packaging box.|$|R
