25|$|Exchange-traded funds <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> {{bonds are}} known as bond ETFs.

Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E

25|$|Human Capital is the {{backbone}} of Human Development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities, the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, {{and the capacity to}} draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form {{the backbone}} of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> the human capital and economic advancement of immigrants who are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth. There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).|$|E

2500|$|The legal {{structure}} of a specific hedge fund, in particular its domicile {{and the type of}} legal entity in use, is usually determined by the tax expectations of the fund's investors. Regulatory considerations will also play a role. Many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and tax-exempt investors. Offshore funds <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> the US typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not US capital gains tax. [...] However, the fund's investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments. This tax treatment promotes cross-border investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors.|$|E

2500|$|Some index ETFs invest 100% {{of their}} assets proportionately in the {{securities}} underlying an index, a manner of investing called replication.

There are various ways the ETF can be weighted, such as equal weighting or revenue weighting. For index ETFs <b>that</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> indices with thousands of underlying securities, some index ETFs employ [...] "aggressive sampling" [...] and invest in only a tiny percentage of the underlying securities.|$|E
