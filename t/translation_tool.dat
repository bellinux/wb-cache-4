Rosetta Stone is a brand of language-learning software published by Rosetta Stone Ltd., headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, US. [...] "Rosetta" [...] {{is the name of}} a [...] "lightweight dynamic translator" [...] that enables applications compiled for PowerPC processors to run on Apple systems using an x86 processor. [...] "Rosetta" [...] is an online language <b>translation</b> <b>tool</b> to help localisation of software, developed and maintained by Canonical as part of the Launchpad project. Similarly, Rosetta@home is a distributed computing project for predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences (or translating sequence into structure). The Rosetta Project brings language specialists and native speakers together to develop a meaningful survey and near-permanent archive of 1,500 languages, intended to last from AD 2000 to 12,000. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft was launched to study the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in the hope that determining its composition will reveal the origin of the Solar System.|$|E
