(The cokernel and kernel of an elliptic operator are in general extremely hard to evaluate individually; the index theorem shows that we can usually at least evaluate their difference.) Many important invariants of a manifold (such as the signature) can be given as the index of suitable differential operators, so the index theorem allows us to evaluate these invariants in terms of <b>topological</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

The basic ideas of data granulation have appeared in many fields, such as interval analysis, quantization, rough set theory, Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, divide and conquer, cluster analysis, machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and many others. Some new <b>topological</b> tools for <b>data</b> granulation using rough set approximations are initiated.

2500|$|Example: Suppose {{that the}} {{manifold}} is the circle (thought of as R/Z), and D is the operator d/dx − λ for some complex constant λ. (This is the simplest {{example of an}} elliptic operator.) Then the kernel is the space of multiples of exp(λx) if λ is an integral multiple of 2πi and is 0 otherwise, and the kernel of the adjoint is a similar space with λ replaced by its complex conjugate. [...] So D has index 0. This example shows that the kernel and cokernel of elliptic operators can jump discontinuously as the elliptic operator varies, {{so there is no}} nice formula for their dimensions in terms of continuous <b>topological</b> <b>data.</b> However the jumps in the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are the same, so the index, given by the difference of their dimensions, does vary continuously, and can be given in terms of <b>topological</b> <b>data</b> by the index theorem.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an {{increased interest in}} the application of persistent homology, a <b>topological</b> tool for <b>data</b> analysis, to machine learning problems. Persistent homology is known for its ability to numerically characterize the shapes of spaces induced by features or functions.

In this paper, we investigate a way to use persistent homology in the framework of deep neural networks. Specifically, we propose to embed the so-called "persistence landscape," a rather new <b>topological</b> summary for <b>data,</b> into a convolutional neural network (CNN) for dealing with audio signals. Our evaluation on automatic music tagging, a multi-label classification task, shows that the resulting persistent convolutional neural network (PCNN) model can perform significantly better than state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy.

40|$|Recently {{several types}} of {{complexes}} have been proposed for <b>topological</b> analysis of <b>data</b> lying on a manifold in a high dimensional space. The effectiveness of the method in practice surely depends on the computational costs of constructing these complexes. The complexes such as restricted Delaunay, alpha complex, Čech and witness complex are difficult to compute in high dimensions. As an alternative, Rips complex, a well known structure in algebraic topology, has been proposed for computing homological information. While their computations are easy, their size tends to be large. We propose a Rips-like complex called geodesic complex which has smaller size than the standard Rips complex. The gain in size results {{from the fact that}} a geodesic complex is built by approximating intrinsic distances on the embedded manifold whereas a Rips complex is built with extrinsic distances in the embedding space.
