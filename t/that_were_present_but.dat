60|$|Still, {{while the}} procession, {{for the third}} time, {{surrounded}} the chapel, the thoughts and the eyes of Kenneth followed exclusively the one among the novices who had dropped the rosebud. Her step, her face, her form were so completely assimilated {{to the rest of}} the choristers that it was impossible to perceive the least marks of individuality; and yet Kenneth's heart throbbed like a bird that would burst from its cage, as if to assure him, by its sympathetic suggestions, that the female who held the right file on the second rank of the novices was dearer to him, not only than all the rest <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>present,</b> <b>but</b> than the whole sex besides. The romantic passion of love, as it was cherished, and indeed enjoined, by the rules of chivalry, associated well with the no less romantic feelings of devotion; and they might be said much more to enhance than to counteract each other. It was, therefore, with a glow of expectation that had something even of a religious character that Sir Kenneth, his sensations thrilling from his heart to the ends of his fingers, expected some second sign of the presence of one who, he strongly fancied, had already bestowed on him the first. Short as the space was during which the procession again completed a third perambulation of the chapel, it seemed an eternity to Kenneth. At length the form which he had watched with such devoted attention drew nigh. There was no difference betwixt that shrouded figure and the others, with whom it moved in concert and in unison, until, just as she passed for the third time the kneeling Crusader, a part of a little and well-proportioned hand, so beautifully formed as to give the highest idea of the perfect proportions of the form to which it belonged, stole through the folds of the gauze, like a moonbeam through the fleecy cloud of a summer night, and again a rosebud lay at the feet of the Knight of the Leopard.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and nature of}} discontinuities in the interplanetary magnetic field at 1 AU in the period March 18, 1971 to April 9, 1971, is determined by using high-resolution magnetic field measurements from Explorer 34. The discontinuities that were selected for this analysis occurred {{under a variety of}} interplanetary conditions at an average rate of 0. 5 /hr. This set does not include all discontinuities <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>present,</b> <b>but</b> the sample is large and it is probably representative. Both tangential and rotational discontinuities were identified, the ratio of TD's to RD's being approximately 3 to 1. Tangential discontinuities were observed every day, even among Alfvenic fluctuations. The structure of most of the boundary layers was simple and ordered, i. e., the magnetic field usually changed smoothly and monotonically {{from one side of the}} boundary layer to the other...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in ACTN 4, {{encoding}} the actin-binding protein α-actinin- 4, cause {{a form of}} familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. We {{had developed}} two strains of transgenic mice with distinct alterations in the expression of α-actinin- 4. One strain carried a human disease-associated mutation in murine Actn 4, whereas the other knockout strain did not express α-actinin- 4 protein. Most adult homozygous Actn 4 mutant and knockout mice developed collapsing glomerulopathy. Homozygous Actn 4 mutant mice also exhibited actin and α-actinin- 4 -containing electron-dense cytoplasmic structures, <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>but</b> less prominent in heterozygous Actn 4 mutant mice and not consistently seen in wild-type or knockout mice. Heterozygous Actn 4 mutant mice did not develop glomerulosclerosis, but did exhibit focal glomerular hypertrophy and mild glomerular ultrastructural changes. The ultrastructural abnormalities seen in heterozygous Actn 4 mutant mice suggest low-level glomerular damage, which may increase susceptibility to injury caused by genetic or environmental stressors. Our studies show that different genetic defects in the same protein produce a spectrum of glomerular morphologic lesions depending on the specific combination of normal and/or defective alleles...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) to the Later Stone Age (LSA) in South Africa {{was not associated with}} the appearance of anatomically modern humans and the extinction of Neandertals, as in the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in Western Europe. It has therefore attracted less attention, yet it provides insights into patterns of technological evolution not associated with a new hominin. Data from Border Cave (KwaZulu-Natal) show a strong pattern of technological change at approximately 44 – 42 ka cal BP, marked by adoption of techniques and materials <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>but</b> scarcely used in the previous MSA, and some novelties. The agent of change was neither a revolution nor the advent of a new species of human. Although most evident in personal ornaments and symbolic markings, the change from one way of living to another was not restricted to aesthetics. Our analysis shows that: (i) at Border Cave two assemblages, dated to 45 – 49 and > 49 ka, show a gradual abandonment of the technology and tool types of the post-Howiesons Poort period and can be considered transitional industries; (ii) the 44 – 42 ka cal BP assemblages are based on an expedient technology dominated by bipolar knapping, with microliths hafted with pitch from Podocarpus bark, worked suid tusks, ostrich eggshell beads, bone arrowheads, engraved bones, bored stones, and digging sticks; (iii) these assemblages mark the beginning of the LSA in South Africa; (iv) the LSA emerged by internal evolution; and (v) the process of change began sometime after 56 ka...|$|E
40|$|Hemiparesis {{is common}} {{following}} stroke. The ability to reach and grasp {{is a necessary}} component of many daily life functional tasks, hence reduced upper limb function {{has an impact on}} the ability to perform activities of daily living. In hemiparetic patients, the unrestricted and unguided repetition of a motor task may reinforce compensatory movements. Trunk restraint allowed the patients to use joint ranges <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>but</b> not recruited during unrestrained reaching. Later, studies combined the trunk restraint training with additional therapeutic interventions. With the growing number of studies on this intervention in the stroke population, there is the need to consolidate this evidence to determine the potential use of trunk restraint training in improving arm reaching in neurological rehabilitation particularly for stroke patients. A considerable research effort had assessed the effects of trunk restraint training on the recovery of reaching movements in hemiparetic patients. This review identified 5 relevant trials in which one trial is a pilot study. Among 5 trials, three trials recorded the movement kinematics (outcome measure) by Optotrak Motion analysis System, in the other two trials the movement kinematics (outcome measure) were analysed by a 6 – camera, 3 D Motion analysis system and 10 – camera Motion Analysis System respectively. The effect size for the intervention was calculated by Cohen’s d. In this review, for the meta-analysis we used trunk displacement, trunk flexion, elbow extension, Smoothness and hand trajectory straightness (movement variables in kinematic analysis). The results of our review demonstrated that the use of trunk restraint as a treatment paradigm aimed at decreasing compensatory strategies has the potential of becoming an effective therapy. Further studies are necessary to determine the long term effect of the trunk restraint training...|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} {{cause is}} dependent {{of the type}} of TMA <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>presented,</b> <b>but</b> the two main pathways that lead to TMA are external triggers of vascular injury, such as viruses, bacterial Shiga toxins or endotoxins, antibodies, and drugs; and congenital predisposing conditions, including decreased levels of tissue factors necessary for the coagulation cascade. Either of these pathways will result in decreased endothelial thromboresistance, leukocyte adhesion to damaged endothelium, complement consumption, enhanced vascular shear stress, and abnormal vWF fragmentation. The central and primary event in this progression is injury to the endothelial cells, which reduces the production of prostaglandin and prostacyclin, ultimately resulting in the loss of physiological thromboresistance, or high thrombus formation rate in blood vessels. Leukocyte adhesion to the damaged endothelial wall and abnormal von Willebrand factor (or vWF) release can also contribute to the increase in thrombus formation. More recently, researchers have attributed both TTP and HUS to targeted agents, such as targeted cancer therapies, immunotoxins, and anti-VEGF therapy.|$|R
