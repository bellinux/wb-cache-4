Following another 6-game road trip to Alaska, the Rage {{continued}} into December winning approximately one-in-three games, with an 11-22-2 record near the mid-season break, when they traded their 20-year-old captain, Blaine Bokenfohr, to the Merritt Centennials in exchange for future considerations.

5|$|While {{wandering}} fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, {{the player}} randomly encounters monsters, {{after which the}} game shifts to battle mode. The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of Dragon Quest. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight <b>the</b> <b>monsters.</b> Once the player defeats all of <b>the</b> <b>monsters,</b> the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.|$|E

5|$|The Pacifist run can be {{obtained}} only after the player has completed one Neutral run through the game {{in which he has}} not murdered any of <b>the</b> <b>monsters</b> and has befriended Papyrus and Undyne. The player befriends Alphys and discovers her true laboratory. It is revealed that Asriel was reincarnated as Flowey, created by Alphys as a vessel of determination (the power that allows Frisk and Flowey to save game files in order to resurrect) as well as an intended surprise for Asgore. The player then returns to fight Asgore, but Toriel intervenes and is joined by the other monsters the human has befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, using the souls of all <b>the</b> <b>monsters</b> to take an older Asriel's form to fight the human and initiate an Apocalypse. The human connects with their new friends during the fight, eventually triumphing. Asriel reverts to his child form, destroys the barrier, and expresses his remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious, and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the human's name – Frisk. <b>The</b> <b>monsters</b> reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Frisk has the option of accepting Toriel as their adoptive mother or striking out on their own.|$|E

When Ygor protests, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> violently pushes him aside {{injuring}} Ygor's spine. Cloestine does not want to lose her brain and <b>the</b> <b>monster</b> reluctantly gives her to Elsa. Ludwig Frankenstein then performs the surgery believing he is putting Kettering's brain in <b>the</b> <b>monster.</b> Bohmer however has substituted Ygor's brain for that of Kettering's.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Monster</b> {{needs to}} grow {{stronger}} {{in order to}} fight the Hunters by hunting and killing other local wildlife {{in order to gain}} experience points. When it gains enough experience, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> can evolve. Through evolution, <b>the</b> <b>Monster's</b> health bar is extended and refilled, and more abilities are available to <b>the</b> <b>Monster,</b> which makes it easier to kill the Hunters. However, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> is vulnerable during its evolution, and if caught by the hunters, the process is disrupted. <b>The</b> <b>Monster</b> can also enter a [...] "stealth mode", allowing it to avoid detection by wildlife and Hunters.|$|R
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can {{use their}} gear to track <b>the</b> <b>Monster's</b> movements. As <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find the location of <b>the</b> <b>monster.</b> Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b> Following <b>the</b> release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained {{the ability to use}} the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to <b>the</b> <b>monster's</b> smell.|$|R
