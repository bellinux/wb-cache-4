40|$|Nowadays, large {{distributed}} databases are commonplace. Client applications increasingly rely on accessing {{objects from}} multiple remote hosts. The Internet {{itself is a}} huge network of computers, sending documents point-to-point by routing packetized data over multiple intermediate relays. As hubs in the network become overutilized, slowdowns and timeouts can disrupt the process. It is thus worth to think about ways to minimize these effects. Caching, i. e. storing replicas of previously-seen objects for later reuse, {{has the potential for}} generating large bandwidth savings and in turn a significant decrease in response time. En-route caching is the concept that all nodes in a network are equipped with a cache, and may opt to keep copies of some documents for future reuse [X. <b>Tang,</b> <b>S.</b> T. Chanson, Coordinated en-route web caching, IEEE Transact. Comput. 51 6 (2002) 595 – 607]. The rules used for such decisions are called ‘‘caching strategies’’. Designing such strategies is a challenging task, because the different nodes interact, resulting in a complex, dynamic system. In this paper, we use genetic programming to evolve good caching strategies, both for specific networks and network classes. An important result is a new innovative caching strategy that outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. # 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} soil pH buffer capacity (pHBC) {{is essential for}} estimating lime requirement and predicting soil acidification in farming systems. The soil pHBC is commonly determined by acid-base titration (1 : 5 soil : solution); however, no standardized equilibration time, type of acid and alkali or concentration of electrolyte has been recommended. This study aimed to establish a standard procedure that is relatively method-independent and reflects the actual soil pH buffering ability. Nineteen soils {{with a wide range}} of pH, clay and organic carbon contents were used. Measuring pHBC in a 0. 01 m CaCl₂ suspension minimized the effects of both ionic strength and cation valence after addition of different types and rates of alkalis and acids. The time required to reach near equilibrium (1 hour to 28 days) was greatly expedited by sonication pretreatment. For soils with a large carbon content, biological reactions alone could elevate soil pHBC and addition of biocides was essential during pHBC measurement. When compared with two commonly used methods, 1 : 1 soil :water extraction and field moist incubation, the 1 : 5 CaCl₂ method was less affected by ionic strength and biological activity, and more suitable for use as a standard method. We recommend using 0. 01 m CaCl₂ at a soil-to-solution ratio of 1 : 5, with addition of HCl and NaOH or Ca(OH) ₂, chloroform and sonication for pHBC determination. X.

40|$|The {{classification}} {{of a chemical}} element as either ‘metal’ or ‘non-metal’ continues to {{form the basis of}} an instantly recognizable, universal representation of the periodic table (Mendeleeff D. 1905 The principles of chemistry, vol.

Here, we review major, pre-quantum-mechanical innovations (Goldhammer DA. 1913 Dispersion und Absorption des Lichtes; Herzfeld KF. 1927 Phys. Rev. 29, 701 – 705) that allow an understanding of the metallic or non-metallic status of the chemical elements under both ambient and extreme conditions. A special emphasis will be placed on recent experimental advances that investigate how the electronic properties of chemical elements vary with temperature and density, and how this invariably relates to a changing status of the chemical elements. Thus, the prototypical non-metals, hydrogen and helium, becomes metallic at high densities; and the acknowledged metals, mercury, rubidium and caesium, transform into their non-metallic forms at low elemental densities. This reflects the fundamental fact that, at temperatures above the absolute zero of temperature, there is therefore no clear dividing line between metals and non-metals. Our conventional demarcation of chemical elements as metals or non-metals within the periodic table is of course governed by our experience {{of the nature of the}} elements under ambient conditions. Examination of these other situations helps us to examine the exact divisions of the chemical elements into metals and non-metals (Mendeleeff D. 1905 The principles of chemistry, vol.

40|$|Glycoprotein B (gB) is {{the most}} highly conserved of the {{envelope}} glycoproteins of human herpesviruses. The gB protein of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) serves multiple roles in {{the life cycle of}} the virus. To investigate structural properties of gB that give rise to its function, we sought to determine the disulfide bond arrangement of gB. To this end, a recombinant form of gB (gB-S) comprising the entire ectodomain of the glycoprotein (amino acids 1 to 750) was constructed and expressed in insect cells. Proteolytic fragmentation and mass spectrometry were performed using purified gB-S, and the five disulfide bonds that link 10 of the 11 highly conserved cysteine residues of gB were mapped. These bonds are C 94 -C 550, C 111 -C 506, C 246 -C 250, C 344 -C 391, and C 573 -C 610. This configuration closely parallels the disulfide bond configuration of herpes simplex type 2 (HSV- 2) gB (N. Norais, D. <b>Tang,</b> <b>S.</b> Kaur, S. H. Chamberlain, F. R. Masiarz, R. L. Burke, and F. Markus, J. Virol. 70 : 7379 - 7387, 1996). However, despite the high degree of conservation of cysteine residues between CMV gB and HSV- 2 gB, the disulfide bond arrangements of the two homologs are not identical. We detected a disulfide bond between the conserved cysteine residue 246 and the nonconserved cysteine residue 250 of CMV gB. We hypothesize that this disulfide bond stabilizes a tight loop in the amino-terminal fragment of CMV gB that does not exist in HSV- 2 gB. We predicted that the cysteine residue not found in a disulfide bond of CMV gB, cysteine residue 185, would play a role in dimerization, but a cysteine substitution mutant in cysteine residue 185 showed no apparent defect in the ability to form dimers. These results indicate that gB oligomerization involves additional interactions other than a single disulfide bond. This work represents the second reported disulfide bond structure for a herpesvirus gB homolog, and the discovery that the two structures are not identical underscores the importance of empirically determining structures even for highly conserved proteins...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment which contains the replication region of pMSC 262, a Mycobacterium scrofulaceum plasmid {{used to construct}} the Mycobacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector. The complete sequence of the fragment contained 2, 504 bp with an overall G+C content of 69. 8 %. By deletion analysis, {{we found that the}} minimum length required for plasmid replication in M. bovis BCG was about 1. 6 kb. Within this region, several open reading frames (ORFs) and a putative replication origin (ori) were identified by computer analysis. One of the ORFs, ORF 2, which encodes a putative 28. 9 -kDa basic protein with characteristics of DNA-binding proteins, appeared to be involved in replication of the plasmid in BCG. By separation of ORF 2 and the putative ori region, it was revealed that the relative locations of ORF 2 and the putative ori region are likely important for replication in BCG. No DNA or amino acid homologies were found between this replication region and that of pAL 5000, another mycobacterial plasmid used for vector plasmid construction. In addition, we found that this replicon did not lead to replication in E. coli and was compatible in BCG with pAL 5000 -derived vector plasmid pYUB 75 (R. G. Barletta, D. D.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that tangible user interfaces (TUIs), defined and scoped by Ishii, provide more intuitive experience for manipulating and reviewing 3 D digital information than conventional {{graphical user interfaces}} (GUIs). Although current TUIs for CAD enable users to intuitively manipulate and directly perceive 3 D digital information via physical objects, they limit users to obtain only external and surface information. The outer 3 D physical bounding shape occludes valuable layered and hierarchical internal information. Only when removing and deforming the external 3 D physical volumes can users define a section-cut surface to inspect internal information. We propose a TUI system that enables users to visually inspect 3 D internal information without modifying its physical outer shell. We implement two popular illustration techniques, namely transparent and cutaway drawings. Using direct touch, hand gestures and tangible tools, users are capable of specifying the transparency and section cut plane intuitively. The system used a combination of projection mapping and perspective correction techniques.

40|$|Eosinophilic {{inflammation}} is {{a common}} feature of numerous eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal (EGID) diseases. Central to eosinophil migration into the gastrointestinal tract are the integrin-mediated interactions with adhesion molecules. Although the mechanisms regulating eosinophil homing into the small intestine have begun to be elucidated, the adhesion pathways responsible for eosinophil trafficking into the large intestine are unknown. We investigated the role of adhesion pathways in eosinophil recruitment into the large intestine during homeostasis and disease. First, using a hapten-induced colonic injury model, we demonstrate that {{in contrast to the}} small intestine, eosinophil recruitment into the colon is regulated by a ß 7 -integrin addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1 -independent pathway. Characterization of integrin expression on colonic eosinophils by flow cytometry analysis revealed that colonic CC chemokine receptor 3 + eosinophils express the intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) counter-receptor integrins L, M, and ß 2. Using ICAM- 1 -deficient mice and anti-ICAM- 1 neutralizing antibodies, we show that hapten-induced colonic eosinophilic inflammation is critically dependent on ICAM- 1.

Since bacterial lipoproteins are often among the most immunogenic of bacterial antigens, we tested whether BCG expression of a target antigen as a membrane-associated lipoprotein could enhance the potential for a recombinant BCG vaccine to elicit high-titered protective antibody responses to target antigens. Immunization of mice with recombinant BCG vaccines expressing the outer surface protein A (OspA) antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi as a membrane-associated lipoprotein resulted in protective antibody responses that were 100 - 1, 000 -fold higher than responses elicited by immunization with recombinant BCG expressing OspA cytoplasmically or as a secreted fusion protein. Furthermore, these improved antibody responses were observed in heterogeneous mouse strains that vary in their immune responsiveness to OspA and sensitivity to BCG growth. Thus, expression of protective antigens as chimeric membrane-associated lipoproteins on recombinant BCG may result in the generation of new candidate vaccines against Lyme borreliosis and other human or veterinary diseases where humoral immunity is the protective response...|$|R
