50|$|The Troy and Tower {{pounds and}} their subdivisions {{were used for}} coins and {{precious}} metals. <b>The</b> Tower <b>pound,</b> which was based upon an earlier Anglo-Saxon pound, was replaced by <b>the</b> Troy <b>pound</b> when a proclamation dated 1526 required <b>the</b> Troy <b>pound</b> {{to be used for}} mint purposes instead of <b>the</b> Tower <b>pound.</b> No standards of <b>the</b> Tower <b>pound</b> are known to have survived.|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{the key to}} {{the whole}} {{measurement}} system of 1266 was the weight of the silver penny sterling. This penny was 1/240th of <b>the</b> Tower <b>pound,</b> which had been used at the London mint for centuries before the Norman conquest, and which continued as legal tender until 1527, when Henry VIII replaced it with <b>the</b> Troy <b>pound.</b> <b>The</b> Tower <b>pound</b> weighed 3/4 Troy ounce less than <b>the</b> Troy <b>pound</b> (15/16th of <b>the</b> Troy <b>pound).</b> Its penny, therefore weighed 22.5 Troy grains.|$|R
5|$|By 1980, {{the council}} {{identified}} land at Maidenbower, south of <b>the</b> <b>Pound</b> Hill neighbourhood, as being suitable for another new neighbourhood, and work began in 1986.

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>pound</b> to {{circulate}} in Sudan was <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>pound.</b> <b>The</b> late 19th century rebels Muhammad ibn Abdalla (the Mahdi) and Abdallahi ibn Muhammad (the Khalifa) both issued coins which circulated alongside the Egyptian currency. When Anglo-Egyptian rule in Sudan ceased on January 1, 1956 and Sudan became an independent country, a distinct Sudanese currency (<b>the</b> Sudanese <b>pound)</b> was created, replacing <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>pound</b> at par.|$|R

5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to <b>the</b> <b>pound,</b> with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to <b>the</b> <b>pound.</b> Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
5|$|By this time, Genesis were {{suffering}} from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel {{at the expense}} of the rest of the band, a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975.

5|$|In 1983, the Hong Kong dollar {{left its}} 16:1 peg with <b>the</b> <b>Pound</b> {{sterling}} and {{switched to the}} current US-HK Dollar peg. Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined due to rising labour and property costs, {{as well as new}} development in southern China under the Open Door Policy introduced in 1978 which opened up China to foreign business. Nevertheless, towards the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre along with London and New York City, a regional hub for logistics and freight, one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia and the world's exemplar of Laissez-faire market policy.|$|E
5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called <b>the</b> <b>pound,</b> where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} {{parameter}} effect of side retainers on seismic response of bridges with flexible rubber bearings. <b>The</b> <b>pounding</b> effect between girder and side retainers is analyzed by the nonlinear time-history analysis. <b>The</b> <b>pounding</b> and sliding of bearings are simulated by the nonlinear contact elements. Comparative analysis of seismic performance of bridge with/without retainers is carried out. Furthermore, the seismic performances of ordinary retainers and new retainers are compared. Finally, {{the effect of}} side retainer parameters on seismic response of bridge is analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} sliding of elastomeric pad bearing should be considered in seismic design. It is shown that the retainers can effectively restrain the relative displacement between girder and piers, and the new type of retainers can greatly reduce <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> force. It is also proved that both stiffness and gap of the retainer have significant influences on <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> force...|$|R

5|$|On 29 January 2009, in {{an effort}} to {{counteract}} runaway inflation, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other, more stable currencies to do business, alongside the Zimbabwe dollar. In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009. In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as the rand (South Africa), the pula (Botswana), the euro, and <b>the</b> <b>Pound</b> Sterling (UK).|$|E
5|$|On the Iberian Peninsula, apothecaries' weights in the 19th {{century were}} {{relatively}} uniform, with 24grains per scruple (576grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries' pound was 345.1g in Spain and 344.2g in Portugal. As in Italy, {{some of the}} additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the obolo, were still in use there. It was standard to use the marco, defined as 8ounces, instead of <b>the</b> <b>pound.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling) that day.|$|E
40|$|To avoid {{unseating}} of a deck, {{an adequate}} seat length must be provided. The seat length is generally determined from a maximum relative displacement between two bridge segments. Under strong ground excitation, pounding between two decks may occur at a joint. <b>The</b> <b>pounding</b> will affect responses of two bridge segments. This {{research was conducted}} to investigate <b>the</b> effect of <b>pounding</b> on <b>the</b> relative displacement between two adjacent bridge segments. A simplified analytical model was developed for such a purpose. To take into account <b>the</b> <b>pounding,</b> <b>the</b> laws of conservation of momentum and energy were applied. The analytical results were represented {{in the form of}} a relative displacement response spectrum with pounding effect. It is found that due to <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> <b>the</b> relative displacement can be amplified, resulting in the requirement of a longer seat length to support a deck...|$|R

5|$|Following the 1966 Defence White Paper, the Air Ministry {{decided on}} two aircraft: the F-111K, with a longer-term {{replacement}} being a joint Anglo-French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft - the Anglo French Variable Geometry Aircraft (AFVG). A censure debate followed on 1 May 1967, in which Healey claimed {{the cost of}} the TSR-2 would have been £1,700 million over 15 years including running costs, compared with £1,000 million for the F-111K/AFVG combination. Although 10 F-111Ks were ordered in April 1966 with an additional order for 40 in April 1967, the F-111 programme suffered enormous cost escalation coupled with the devaluation of <b>the</b> <b>pound,</b> far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection. Many technical problems were still unresolved before successful operational deployment and, faced with poorer-than-projected performance estimates, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was eventually cancelled in January 1968.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the impact interaction between the abutment and the girder subjected to nonuniform seismic excitation. An impact model based on tests is presented by taking material properties of the backfill of the abutment into consideration. The conditional simulation is performed to investigate the spatial variation of earthquake ground motions. A two-span continuous steel box girder bridge is taken as the example to analyze and assess <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> interaction between <b>the</b> abutment and the girder. The detailed nonlinear finite element (FE) model is established and the steel girder and the reinforced concrete piers are modeled by nonlinear fiber elements. <b>The</b> <b>pounding</b> element of <b>the</b> abutment is simulated by using a trilinear compression gap element. The elastic-perfectly plastic element is used to model the nonlinear rubber bearings. The comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> forces, <b>the</b> shear forces of the nonlinear bearings, the moments of reinforced concrete piers, and <b>the</b> axial <b>pounding</b> stresses of <b>the</b> steel girder are studied.
