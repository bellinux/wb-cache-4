50|$|In the cellar, the Doctor {{hears the}} Spheriosis {{under the ground}} again. He jumps for the stairs, and a trunk of roots breaks through the ground into the cellar. The Doctor calls for help, {{attracting}} the trunk's attention. It shoots at the Doctor, just as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked.</b> The Doctor escapes, and the door is closed by Vanessa.|$|E
5000|$|In the James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever, Bond is seen gaining {{entry to}} the Whyte {{laboratory}} with a then-state-of-the-art card-access lock system by [...] "tailgating". He merely waits for an employee to come to open the door, then posing himself as a rookie at the lab, fakes inserting a non-existent card while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> for him by the employee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mark of a}} good passive entry {{system is}} that the user never hits the [...] "wall". This happens when the user pulls the door handle to its full extent before <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked.</b> The handle has to be {{released}} and pulled again to gain access. Good systems have an override feature that allows the doors to be opened more quickly.|$|E
50|$|If only <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>were</b> <b>unlocked.</b>|$|R
60|$|Not {{long after}} this <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked</b> and Porler {{came into the}} room.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked,</b> and in sped {{a terrified}} man. He {{was one of}} the spies who had been sent out.|$|R
50|$|Another type of lock {{also called}} a police lock and also {{formerly}} {{made by the}} Fox Police Lock Company is the crossbar police lock. It features two steel bars across {{the width of the}} door and beyond, held by two brackets set in the doorframe. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked,</b> the bars are moved inwards {{to the point of being}} withdrawn from the brackets.|$|E
50|$|When {{they arrive}} at the mysterious funeral home, Justins cousin James, who works there, does not respond to their knocks on the front door. After noticing that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked,</b> the two teenage boys look around, but find the place deserted. Soon, they find James and the entire funeral staff dead. Suddenly, a strange man, (Michael Ironside), a vampire, attacks them, biting Kerrys neck while Justin is forced to flee.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{access control}} uses {{computers}} {{to solve the}} limitations of mechanical locks and keys. A wide range of credentials {{can be used to}} replace mechanical keys. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the door and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked</b> {{and thrown}} open, and Janet {{and her father}} rushed in, anxious to learn the cause of these reiterated exclamations.|$|R
50|$|Charlotte, Michael and Liz remain {{locked out}} of the toilet until Charlotte breaks in {{only to find out}} that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked</b> <b>the</b> whole time.|$|R

50|$|A wealthy {{publisher}} and collector of precious stones and Chinese postage stamps has a luxurious suite {{in a hotel}} that serves to handle his non-publishing business and {{the comings and goings}} of his staff, his relatives, and his female friends. When an odd and anonymous little man arrives and refuses to state his business, no one is surprised; he is locked (from outside only) in an anteroom with a bowl of fruit (including tangerines, also known as Chinese oranges) and left to await the publisher's arrival. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked,</b> though, a truly bizarre scene is displayed.|$|E
50|$|A man {{and woman}} who are {{engaged to be married}} may not dwell {{together}} unless other people are in the same house and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked.</b> Leaving the door slightly ajar is commendable. They may not stay together even on a temporary basis, such as in a hotel. According to some poskim, sleeping in the same house if other family members are present does not violate yichud laws, but should be avoided due to tzniut considerations. Others, including Moses Isserles and Joseph Soloveitchik, however, disagree about this and would not permit sleeping in the home of their future in-laws.|$|E
50|$|The film {{starts off}} with Detective Barton (John Stuart) {{arriving}} at a house marked for sale or rent. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> and he wanders in. An unknown person with a candle is wandering about and a dead body is found. When confronted the mysterious person claims innocence of the murdered person. Barton (who introduces himself as Forsythe) asks the stranger what he has in his pockets (handkerchief, string, sausage, picture of a child, half a cigarette), before {{the shadow of a}} hand is shown reaching for a doorknob. The stranger (who later introduces himself as Ben) searches the body of the dead person and finds handcuffs and a gun which he takes.|$|E
60|$|Like a pair {{of ghosts}} they glided up the front stairs, along the broad hallway, {{and down the stairs}} in <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked,</b> and they passed into the yard.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} passed, {{and the train}} {{came to a halt}} and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked.</b> Nobody got out, but a round and ruddy-faced man got in and nodded to all those present.|$|R
60|$|Dora {{got down}} {{and looked through}} the keyhole. It was clear and she quickly {{inserted}} the key taken from the hook. It fitted perfectly, and in a second more <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A set {{of doors}} kept locked on each floor to prevent unintentional access into the {{elevator}} shaft by the unsuspecting individual. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> and opened by a machine sitting {{on the roof of}} the car, which also drives the doors that travel with the car. Door controls are provided to close immediately or reopen the doors, although the button to close them immediately is often disabled during normal operations, especially on more recent elevators. Objects in the path of the moving doors will either be detected by sensors or physically activate a switch that reopens the doors. Otherwise, the doors will close after a preset time. Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.|$|E
50|$|The Berlin key (also known as, German, Schließzwangschlüssel, or, English, forced locking key) {{is a key}} for a type of door lock. It was {{designed}} to force people to close and lock their doors (usually a main entrance door or gate leading into a common yard or tenement block). Its particularity {{comes from the fact}} that it has two key blades (the part which activates the bolt), one at each end of the key, rather than the usual single blade. After unlocking the lock, the key must be pushed all the way through the lock and retrieved on the other side of the door after it has been closed and locked again. The mechanism makes the retrieval of the key impossible when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked.</b> Also, locking an open door is usually not possible.|$|E
5000|$|Dr Subbiah {{immediately}} suspects Chandra Chagoo {{of having}} stolen the A.C.E. and leads Ghote to the reptile room. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> they find Chagoo dead with a Russell's viper {{loose in the}} room. [...] The next day the Commissioner assigns Ghote to investigate Chagoo's death to prevent the scandal being exposed by another officer. Ghote realises that Chagoo {{did not have a}} key to lock the reptile room door and must have been murdered. Ghote interviews Dr Ram Mahipal, who left a reptile-room key in his old office at the institute when he suddenly quit his job. Ghote learns from the building manager that Mahipal returned in order to access his computer files on the night Chagoo died. Dr Subbiah, Professor Phaterpaker, Dr Mahipal and the building manager were all in the building at the time.|$|E
60|$|Another {{fifteen minutes}} passed, and then {{those in the}} room heard {{footsteps}} outside. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked</b> and Professor Duke appeared, followed by Pud Hicks and Bob Nixon {{and two of the}} mess-room waiters.|$|R
60|$|She {{must have}} {{recognized}} his voice, {{for the light}} disappeared from the apartment, and in {{a second or two}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked</b> and opened, and Sue appeared with a candle in her hand.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked,</b> a {{thumb screw}} inside {{apparently}} {{made it difficult}} for a child to open. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> had a knob on the outside, but only a small turn latch on the inside.|$|R
50|$|Visiting a doctor's {{office is}} allowed during regular office hours, when people may enter unexpectedly. Otherwise, a shomer is required. Mortal danger always {{overrides}} yichud laws, {{although there are}} authorities who disagree with this. Serious illness, on the other hand, does not alleviate the prohibition of yichud. An exception is, according to Moshe Feinstein, a male patient who has been diagnosed as impotent, {{but in this case}} marit ayin calls for carefulness. A dependent adult person in need of care should take a caregiver of the same gender. This applies also to very old men. During daytime, an opposite gender housekeeper and medical staff may visit if <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked,</b> or the neighbors have a key and are asked to come in unannounced from time to time. Some poskim are lenient {{when it comes to a}} doctor's interaction with his patients, since he is supposedly consumed by his work and not likely to think sinful thoughts. They invoke Gemara, which applies this reasoning to allow a professional to mate animals, although it is otherwise forbidden to watch animals mate.|$|E
5000|$|The bookstore is closed, but <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked.</b> Batman and Robin enter, {{and quickly}} {{discover}} {{a note that}} leads them to a slim volume titled, [...] "The Truth About Bats." [...] Removing it from the shelf opens a concealed door into Eivol Ekdol's workshop and his [...] "Inescapable Doom Trap". A fake bat inside leads the duo into the trap. Its space age plastic resists the tools from their utility belts, deadly gas begins to pour in, and the floor vent is electrified. But the gas rises; Robin realizes it must contain hydrogen. Using their metal belt buckles, the Duo creates a spark and the exploding gas bursts apart the trap. As they're about to pass between the mummies, inside where the machine gun equipped gangsters lurk, Zelda warns them. They duck and the gangsters kill each other with crossfire. Ekdol tries to escape, but Batman knocks him out with a Batarang. A tearful Zelda surrenders, truly remorseful. While Ekdol is taken into custody, Zelda is granted her reprieve.|$|E
50|$|Through the {{incompetence}} of Fritz, {{a criminal}} brain was secured for Frankenstein's experiments {{instead of the}} desired normal one. The manufactured monster, despite its grotesque form, initially {{appears to be a}} simple, innocent creation. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the monster. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the monster locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the monster's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman find the monster has strangled Fritz. The monster lunges at the two but they escape, locking the monster inside. Realizing that the creature must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the monster and inject it as it attacks. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> the creature lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the creature's back. The monster falls to the floor unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|A {{very brief}} {{conversation}} ensued. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked.</b> Mr. Pickwick {{stepped out of}} the closet, and found himself {{in the presence of the}} whole establishment of Westgate House, Mr Samuel Weller, and--old Wardle, and his destined son-in-law, Mr. Trundle! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlocked,</b> {{for those}} inside had not {{dreamed of being}} disturbed. On tiptoes the party entered the dark hallway.

5000|$|A joke ending {{was shot}} in one-take by Radio Silence in which <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlocked</b> and <b>the</b> boys get out just before the train smashes into their car.

50|$|Taking {{place on}} the 17th June 2019, ten months after Vita-01’s last {{broadcast}} to Earth with the message “stay alone, stay alive” on 8 August 2018. The investigation team of Kenzo Uji, Martin Karne, and Diane Matlock approach Vita-01 on Mars in their spacecraft. Vita01’s main computer MOOD appears to have noticed their arrival. Kenzo is forced to make a crash landing on the Martian surface and its crew depart into different airlocks of Vita01. MOOD apathetically predicts that, although the three have entered only two will leave alive. The trio are separated and obtain radios from their spacesuits to stay in verbal contact. All three go through decontamination, but each notes {{that there was something}} wrong with the decontamination. Initially only Kenzo can enter the base as Karne and Matlock’s airlock doors are sealed. Kenzo stumbles upon various dead bodies in the silent hallways, including the corpse of the base’s leader, Antonio Fellicci. By listening to the recording found on his corpse, Kenzo discovers that Vita-01’s downfall came when the people started shooting at each other in the base hallways. Kenzo finds Fellicci’s room but finds a dead body supernaturally levitating in the hallway. Using Fellicci’s computer, Kenzo unseals the door to Karne’s airlock. However once <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> the dead body of Fellicci’s girlfriend re-animated and tried to attack Kenzo.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, several {{security}} {{measures have been}} employed to combat the menace of insecurity of lives and property. This is done by preventing unauthorised entrance into buildings through entrance doors using conventional and electronic locks or discrete access code. Thus, the main idea in this project is to design a database security system that allows only authorised user to enter the premises. There are two entry point with each using different technologies; RFID & keypad. Once the user’s identification is verified, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> by using EDL (electronic door lock) and all the information such as user ID, date and time are stored in central office.

40|$|A {{digital access}} control system allows users to access a premise using an access card. It is {{introduced}} as an alternative system to the most common {{access control system}} using physical keys and mechanical locks to increase the level of convenience to access a premise. However, an intruder is able {{to gain access to}} the premise if he/she possesses the access card or the physical keys. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an access control system that utilizes near field communication (NFC) smartphone and information hiding technique to overcome the disadvantage mentioned previously on the existing systems. The first protection level is NFC smartphone and NFC reader or tag to initiate the access control to the premise. The second protection level is the information hiding technique to embed access passcode into the user's photo to obtain an encoded photo, which is also known as stego-photo. The access passcode in the stego-photo is later extracted using information hiding technique during the door access stage for verification of the legitimate user. An automated door is developed and NFC reader or tag is located near the door. The interaction between NFC smartphone and NFC reader or tag enables prompting of the correct stego-photo to be selected using the smartphone to perform the user authentication process. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlocked</b> if the access passcode extracted from the stego-photo matches with the access passcode in the database located at the server. If otherwise, alarm is triggered and a light emitting diode (LED) is turned on. The lighted LED acts as an indicator to give an alert to the user that someone has tried to break into his/her house when he/she is not around...|$|E

50|$|Many modern SUVs use height {{adjustability}} as part {{of active}} suspension systems to improve the vehicle's versatility on and off-road. The Range Rover offered this feature from 1993. New models of the Ford Expedition have a computer-controlled system designed for convenience, which lowers automatically when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> <b>unlocked</b> by remote, returns to normal height when the vehicle is started, and (on 4-wheel-drive models), raises when the 4x4 system is engaged.|$|R
