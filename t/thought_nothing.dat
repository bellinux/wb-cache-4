5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the erasure {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E

25|$|In late 1999, Wallace began feeling {{intermittently}} ill. Family members variously {{remember him}} as acting unsteady, coughing and seeming swollen. As his inexplicable sickness persisted over the holiday season, his family {{encouraged him to}} seek medical care, but he died in early 2000 before he could do so. Their daughter Ashley was 11 {{at the time and}} had been alone with him. She blamed herself for his death. She had noticed his ill appearance that day, but <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of it.|$|E
25|$|Spruance was {{an active}} man who <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were {{generally}} simple.

Fit into his 70s, Spruance {{spent most of his}} retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; he loved to show them to visitors.|$|E

At the hospital, {{it was discovered that}} he had fractured his skull (the second time that he had fractured his skull in his football career). He immediately retired from football, having set the goal-kicking record of 152 goals in a single season.|$|E

Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "there are only fragments of <b>thoughts,</b> <b>nothing</b> is developed." [...] Charles Ealy of Austin 360 compared it to watching Mike Myers's Sprockets sketch from Saturday Night Live. Bordwell has criticized other reviewers' shallow analysis of the film, stating that [...] "critics put off by Godard, I think, have too limited a notion of what criticism is." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1690, the Great Parlour Chamber was {{occupied}} by John Batt. It has a garderobe or toilet in the outer wall. The rush matting in this and other family rooms was a feature of wealthy households, and was warmer than bare floorboards or stone floors. The fireplace is a 19th-century addition, one of few interior structural changes made since the 17th century. The inclusion of a table and chairs in a bed chamber in the 17th century was not unusual. Bed chambers had a dual purpose where their occupiers <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of entertaining guests with wine or cards.|$|E

That same year she hit the stage with actor Morgan Freeman for Shakespeare in the Park's production of The Taming of the Shrew; she then made her Broadway debut with her one-woman show, The Big Love. She had no aspirations {{to return to the}} television. In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special. Ullman <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> would come of it, but to her horror, she learnt that the bid was successful.|$|E

[...] Wolters regarded his mother as [...] "a highly practical woman, full of zest for life, who in hard times <b>thought</b> <b>nothing</b> of serving a delicious roast without letting on it was horsemeat". [...] Wolters passed a generally happy childhood, punctuated by the chaos of the war years, and by a childhood illness that resulted in his being taught at home for a year by two priests.|$|E

Mandelson contended that he had deliberately not taken part in any decisions relating to Robinson. However, he had not declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests, and resigned in December 1998. Mandelson had also not declared the loan to his building society (the Britannia) although they decided not to take any action, with the CEO stating [...] "I am satisfied that the information given to us {{at the time of}} the mortgage application was accurate."

[...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner.

2500|$|How can we {{find out}} of the single {{individual}} is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, [...] "Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference.
