In 1994 the UNDP launched the notion of ‘human security’ in its World Development Report. The concept was welcomed, but also criticised due to its lack of operationalisation and vagueness. The War on Terror pushed it again somewhat to the background {{with its emphasis on}} coercive approaches and its centrality of state or homeland security. However, the course of events in several ‘theatres of war’ such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the frequent misconceptions of terrorism, as well as the recent developments in <b>Tunesia</b> and Egypt compel us to take a fresh look at people-centred approaches to security and peace. In this paper I will sketch the origins and development of the human security approach, its strengths and weaknesses, and will elaborate on the renewed relevance of these at the present juncture...|$|E

The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) has an {{enormous}} range, from <b>Tunesia</b> to deep into Russia. A range-wide recent study revealed a marked genetic differentiation, with one species in and adjacent to the Iberian Peninsula (Bufo spinosus), two species in the Caucasus and the—still very wide ranging—Bufo bufo. We expanded upon our work as follows. (1) With mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, we confirmed the deep split and that the mutual range border of B. bufo and B. spinosus is in France. (2) We searched for morphological characters that would discriminate the species in France and we tested some potentially informative characters on museum material (Leiden, Paris and Madrid) covering a North to South transect in western Europe, from the UK to southern Spain. (3) We identified {{the position of the}} contact zone in France, from the Atlantic coast to the upper Rhone valley near Lyon, which gave us some clues about the “why” of morphological species differentiation. Finally, (4) we scrutinized published nuclear data to investigate claims of hybridization and extensive introgression among species across the Mediterranean. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{list of all}} liverworts and mosses {{reported}} from the Maltese Islands with references has been compiled from the literature, which includes 23 species of liverworts and hornworts as well as 96 taxa of mosses [...] The list is completed {{by the results of}} a bryological fieldtrip in March 2008. During this trip, 14 species of liverworts and 40 species of mosses were collected, of which Cephaloziella baumgartneri, Didymodon luridus, Fissidens gracilifolius, Fossombronia echinata, Funaria pulchella, Riccia cavernosa and Weissia fallax are new to Malta. This raises the number of species known from the Maltese Islands to 23 horn- and liverworts and 100 mosses. The Maltese Islands (Malta, Gozo and Comino) form a small archipelago between <b>Tunesia</b> and Sicily, 300 km away from the African continent. It is part of the African plate and consists completely of a flat limestone plate from the Tertiary, mainly Globigerina limestone. Until 12. 000 years ago, it was connected with Europe and Africa by a landbridge. The higher vegetation is much disturbed by human influence. The islands were colonized about 9000 years ago, were heavily deforested and are densely populated today. There are about 390. 000 inhabitants on only 312 square kilometres. As a consequence, there are only between 25 and 30 individual trees left from the native forest tree species (Quercus ilex), some about 1000 years old (Weber & Kendzio...|$|E
40|$|The Arab Spring {{recently}} {{highlighted the}} problem of migrants at sea and the shortcomings of the international legal framework. Indeed, due to the social uprisings in <b>Tunesia</b> and Lybia, thousands of people tried to reach Europe by sea. This is a dangerous journey, as these asylum seekers often travel in unseaworthy vessels. As {{a result of the}} Arab Spring, it is estimated that more than 1. 500 people drowned or went missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe in 2011. These events are a reminder of the extremes that people in difficult situations sometimes resort to. The international community is aware that this problem has to be tackled as soon as possible in order to prevent further loss of life. This article first deals with the current international legal framework concerning migrants at sea and its shortcomings. Secondly, {{we take a look at}} how Malta interprets the existing obligations. Thirdly, recent developments within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the Draft Regional Agreement for the Mediterranean Basin – an agreement hoping to solve {{the problem of}} disembarking migrants at sea in the Mediterranean – will be highlighted. Finally, we will discuss how Malta – a small State of only 316 km 2 – influences the content of the agreement and how this island itself is being affected by it...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} democratic {{elements in}} early Islamic sources {{and in the}} programs of the Algerian FIS (Front Islamique du Salut) and ANNAHDA in <b>Tunesia.</b> According to historic writings, Islam includes the principles of democratic consensus, consultation, and freedom of opinion, and an understand- ing that the sources of Islamic jurisdiction are subject to interpretation, that the sharia can be changed, and that religious authorities’ power to issue in- structions on worldly matters is limited. These are the type of expectations that fundamentalist parties arouse when they speak of an Islamic caliphate as a state system. Against this background, {{an examination of the}} political system proposed until 1992 by the Algerian FIS shows that this system would have resulted in a very restrictive form of Islam. An investigation of the political system of the Tunisian fundamentalist leader Rached al-Ghannouchi reveals that the system he proposes may be designated as an Islamic democracy, since it takes into account separation of powers and pluralism of po- litical parties. The head of state would be subject to the law {{in the same manner as}} the people. However, it is no liberal democracy, as he categorically rejects secularism, intends to punish apostates, and is only willing to allow political parties that are based on the religion of Islam. His state would only be a state of those citizens who follow Islam, completely neglecting secularist groups. Social conflicts and unrest are thus predetermined...|$|E

Some {{of these species}} could only be identified by comparison with type material from the British Museum (Nat. Hist.). The following taxonomic changes are neccessary: Clytocerus wollastoni SATCHELL, 1953, is endemic of Madeira; in continental North Africa it is replaced by C. kabylicus sp. n. Panimerus fraudulentus identified by VAILLANT from the western alps is differed from the Algerian type material. VAILLANT's species therefore is named Jungiella occidentalis sp. n. Both species are provisionally placed in genus Jungiella VAILLANT, {{because of the presence}} of a furca. Tonnoiriella atlantica SATCHELL is redescribed. Adequate figures of all North African species mentioned are provided. The closest biogeographic relations of North African Psychodidae seem to be with western palearctic fauna. There is no evident connection with the afrotropical region. North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula share the following species: Pericoma barbarica VAILLANT and Mormia tenebricosa VAILLANT. Thornburghiella quezeli (VAILLANT, 1955) and Pericoma latina SARA, 1954, are distributed over the Appenin Peninsula and North Africa. The Berdeniella lucasii-species-group has a circumthyrrhenian distribution. Tonnoirella atlantica, Clytocerus kabylicus sp. n., Philosepedon beaucornui, Mormia similis sp. n., Jungiella fraudulenta, and Jungiella malickyi sp. n. are definitely restricted to North Africa...|$|E
40|$|The warming {{trend that}} started in the latest Paleocene and culminated in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) between 52 and 50 Ma is punctuated by {{short-lived}} hyperthermals, like the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) that marks {{the base of the}} Eocene. Such short-lived hyperthermals are linked to global carbon cycle perturbations and associated with major floral and faunal changes. Orbital pacing is probably triggering these hyperthermal perturbations. After the EECO a cooling trend sets in only interrupted by a short Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) {{in the beginning of the}} Bartonian; at the beginning of the Oligocene the cooling trend is leading to the start of the present ice-house state with the growth of the first large Antarctic ice sheets. The Paleogene timescale is based on the seafloor magnetic field reversals in combination with radio-isotopically or astronomically dated control points. The GTS 2012 used astronomically derived ages in the intervals 66 - 53 and 37 - 23 Ma and a radio-isotopical age model in the interval between 53 and 37 Ma. It is expected that it will become possible in the future to extend the astrochronological scale to the entire Paleogene. The stage GSSP’s of Danian (El Kef, <b>Tunesia),</b> Selandian and Thanetian (Itzurun Beach, Zumaia, Basque County, Spain), Ypresian (Dababiya section, Luxor, Egypt), Lutetian (Gorrondatxe cliff, Basque County, Spain) and Rupelian (Massignano section, Ancona, Italy) have already been defined. For defining the Priabonian and the Chattian GSSP’s, suitable sections are to be discussed respectively the Alano di Piave section in the Venetian southern Alps and the Monte Cagnero section in the northeastern Apennines of Umbria-Marche in Italy. The Bartonian, historically referring to marine clays and sands in coastal sections of the Hampshire basin in England, is still lacking a suitable GSSP section; in GTS 2004 and 2012 its base is provisionally kept at the C 19 n/C 18 r magnetic reversal. Potential Bartonian GSSP sections will be discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
