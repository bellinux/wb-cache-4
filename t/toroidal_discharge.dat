40|$|In a <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharge</b> tube, a {{constant}} electrie ring field is induced {{for a time}} much longer than the electron collision time. The inducing magnetic field, however, is prevented from penetrating the discharge tube. The torus contains a weakly preionized gas. When the electric field is applied, the electron density essentially grows exponentially with time. If losses can be neglected, the exponential coefficient is identical with the ionization rate. The growtry rates of the electron density are determined by microwave interferometry for electron densities of 10 ^ 11 - 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3. Ionlzatlon rates have been measured as function of E/p in hydrogen and nitrogen. ...|$|E

Tensor Technology Inc. has recently developed a methodology that will detect explosive compounds with pulsed fast neutron transmission spectroscopy. In this scheme, tritium beams {{will be used to}} generate neutrons with a broad energy spectrum as governed by the T(t, 2 n) 4 He fission reaction that produces 0 - 9 MeV neutrons. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), in collaboration with Tensor Technology Inc., has designedand fabricated a pulsed white-spectrum neutron source for this application. The specifications of the neutron source are demanding and stringent due to the requirements of high yield and fast pulsing neutron emission, and sealed tube, tritium operation. In a unique co-axial geometry, the ion source uses ten parallel rf induction antennas to externally couple power into a <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharge</b> chamber. There are 20 ion beam extraction slits and 3 concentric electrode rings to shape and accelerate the ion beam into a titanium cone target. Fast neutron pulses are created by using a set ofparallel-plate deflectors switching between +- 1500 volts and deflecting the ion beams across a narrow slit. The generator is expected to achieve 5 ns neutron pulses at tritium ion beam energies between 80 - 120 kV. First experiments demonstrated ion source operation and successful beam pulsing...|$|E
40|$|At {{temperatures}} {{of several hundred}} million degrees, in deuterium, the energy generated by nuclear re-actions will exceed the radiation loss. This fact suggested to one of us (G. P. T.), in 1946, that useful power might be generated from such reactions, pro-vided {{that the loss of}} energy to the walls could be sufficiently reduced by magnetic fields. Experiments were begun at Imperial College, London, in February 1947, to produce very large currents in a low-pressure gas discharge. The containment of the gas was to be achieved by the pinch effect and a <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharge</b> tube was used to eliminate end losses. Currents in the range 1 x 104 - 2 x 104 amp were induced in the gas by discharging a condenser of maximum energy 400 joules through a primary winding coupled with the gas. 1 These experiments were the first to demonstrate a marked pinch effect in a gas discharge, although inertial effects caused the contracting discharge to overswing and expand again, followed by further contractions and expansions. 2 In order to achieve {{temperatures of}} several million degrees and demonstrate a thermonuclear reaction it was clear from the Bennett 3 relation, 2 NkT = 72, that currents of the order 105 amp were required. (N is the total number of particles per unit length of the discharge, k Boltzmann's constant, T the tempera-ture and / the current.) When, however, the condenser energy was increased in 1950 to 18, 000 joules, serious crazing and evaporation of the small Pyrex glass dis-charge tubes occurred and it became necessary to develop superior materials to contain the large currents. At this juncture thermonuclear research was made secret by the Government and, because of the un-desirabüity of conducting secret research at a university, the staff and apparatus were moved to th...|$|E
40|$|Before {{presenting}} {{a summary of}} the work on con-trolled thermonuclear fusion in the Federal Republic of Germany, I should like to make some general comments about the scope and background of this work Soon after the first Geneva Conference on the Peace-ful Uses of Atomic Energy, physicists m a number of scientific institutions m Western Germany began to give serious attention to the potential possibilities of controlled fusion The advantages of thermonuclear devices and of using magnetic fields for containing the hot charged particles were realized very early It was natural, therefore, that both experimental physicists with experience in the physics of gaseous discharges, plasmas and theoretical astrophysicists with their acquaintance with magnetohydrodynamics and with the propagation of cosmic rays m cosmic magnetic fields, started to think about how a plasma with the required high temperature could be controlled I may say that the closest connections to our work are to be found, perhaps, in the developments at Princeton and at Harwell Experiments on high current discharges at Gottingent and Aachen î are as yet on a fairly small scale as compared with some of the other experiments described at this conference, although experiments with <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharges,</b> suitable exterior magnetic fields, and large diameters ranging between 40 cm and 1 m, have also been considered at Aachen and Gottingen In addition to the work on <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharges,</b> high current linear discharges are or will be used to in-vestigate controlled fusion problems at Aachen...|$|R

It is well known, however, from previous experiments carried out in Russian and other laboratories that instabilities in the current channel can give rise to strong electric fields which accelerated deuterons and can produce neutrons.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} study of a plasma which is made strongly turbulent by conducting an electric current. The experiments are performed on the cylindrical potassium plasma column which exists between the hot and cold end-plates of a single-ended Q-machine. The plasma is continuously produced at the hotplate by contact ionization and confined radially by a strong axial magnetic field such that Ï ce Â» Ï pe. The electrons and ions are initially close to thermal equilibrium with the hotplate, with a common temperature â 0. 2 eV. The plasma density (~ 10 9 cm - 3), is such that the time for collisions between electrons and ions is very long compared to the time taken for an electron to travel {{the length of the}} column. Pulsed electron currents of duration ~ 2 Î¼s are drawn through the plasma by applying positive voltage pulses (â² 100 V) to the cold plate. Simple electrical measurements indicate that, above a critical current, the plasma has an anomalously low conductivity accompanied by the onset of a high level of potential fluctuations, which are detected in the plasma by electrostatic probes. A diagnostic technique has been developed to study the temporal evolution of the distribution function of axial electron velocities. This involves time-resolved measurements of the dispersion of electron plasma waves during the current pulse. Analysis of this dispersion gives unambiguous measurements of the electron density n, drift velocity v d, and root mean square (or thermal) velocity v e, during the pulse. The results indicate that, after an. initial transient, n and v d are axially uniform, n remains equal to the initial value and the current drawn from the plasma gives a good measure of their product. The critical current corresponds to v d = 1. 3 v c, which linear theory predicts, is the threshold for the electron-ion two-stream instability. Above this threshold, v e quickly exceeds v d and, in contrast to the predictions of linear theory and computer simulation, continues to rise for constant v d to high values, (indicating electron temperatures â² 80 eV), limited only by the energy containment time of the column. The values of conductivity deduced from the effective scattering rate and from the electrical measurements are in good agreement, and are consistent with an empirical scaling law found in a pulsed <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharge</b> by other workers. Measurements on the potential fluctuations indicate a broad frequency spectrum: in the low frequencies the correlation lengths were too short to be measured; in the high frequencies the fluctuations were shown to consist of relatively coherent, long wavelength electron plasma waves. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of minimum energy dissipation rate is utilized {{to develop a}} unified model for relaxation in <b>toroidal</b> <b>discharges.</b> The Euler-Lagrange equation for such relaxed states is solved in toroidal coordinates for an axisymmetric torus by expressing the solutions in terms of Chandrasekhar-Kendall (C-K) eigenfunctions analytically continued in the complex domain, The C-K eigenfunctions are hyppergeometric functions that are solutions of the scalar Helmholtz equation in toroidal coordinates in the large-aspect-ratio approximation. Equilibria are constructed by assuming the total current J= 0 at the edge. This yields the eigenvalues for a given aspect-ratio. The most novel feature of the present model is that solutions allow for tokamak, low-q as well as reversed field pinch-like behavior with {{a change in the}} eigenvalue characterizing the relaxed state.

The {{model has been}} developed to obtain insight into the ICRF plasma parameters, particle fluxes to {{the walls and the}} main collisional processes, which is especially relevant for the comprehension of RF wall conditioning discharges. The 0 D plasma description is based on the energy and particle balance equations for nine principal species: H, H+, H- 2, H- 2 (+), H- 3 (+), He, He+, He- 2 (+) and e(-). It takes into account (1) elementary atomic and molecular collision processes, such as excitation/ radiation, ionization, dissociation, recombination and charge exchange, and elastic collisions, (2) particle losses due to the finite dimensions of the plasma volume and confinement properties of the magnetic configuration, and particle recycling, (3) active pumping and gas injection, (4) RF heating of electrons (and protons) and (5) a qualitative description of plasma impurities. The model reproduces experimental plasma density dependences on discharge pressure and coupled RF power, both for hydrogen RF discharges (n(e) approximate to (1 - 5) x 10 (10) cm(- 3)) and for helium discharges (n(e) approximate to (1 - 5) x 10 (11) cm(- 3)).
