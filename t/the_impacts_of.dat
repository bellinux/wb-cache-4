5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment.

5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{increasing}} enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 {{faculty and staff}} by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.

A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks on traffic flow and propose an {{improved}} cellular automaton model, which considers both the performance difference between passenger {{cars and trucks}} and the behaviour change of passenger cars under <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks. A questionnaire survey has been conducted {{to find out whether}} <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks exists and how the behaviour of passenger car drivers changes under <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks. <b>The</b> survey results confirm that <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks exists and indicate that passenger car drivers will enlarge the space gap, decelerate, and change lanes in advance when they are affected. Simulation results show that traffic volume is still affected by percentages of trucks in the congestion phase in the proposed model compared with traditional heterogeneous cellular automaton models. Traffic volume and speed decrease with <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks in <b>the</b> congestion phase. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> trucks can increase traffic congestion as it increases. However, it has different influences on the speed variance of passenger cars in different occupancies.

5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> volcanic ash fall in modern society and {{our dependence on}} the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E

Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> the changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are more clearly observed in the more humid eastern parts of the country (between Uruguay and southern Brazil).

In general, El Niño tends to increase precipitation during late spring and summer, particularly in the north. <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> La Niña in the eastern parts of the country (northeast and the Pampas) are observed in winter where precipitation is lower. In Northwest Argentina, El Niño events are associated with a strong reduction in rainfall during summer. In contrast, La Niña events increase precipitation in northwest Argentina. In the central–western parts of Patagonia, spring precipitation tends to be lower during La Niña events and higher during El Niño events.
