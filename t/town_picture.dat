50|$|The initial {{idea for}} a museum was {{suggested}} in 1981 by the late Arnold Baines a longstanding Chesham resident, councillor and local historian. The Francis Trust was originally set up to raise funds to restore a painting known as the <b>Town</b> <b>Picture</b> and having achieved this objective the Trust's volunteers took up the challenge to establish a town museum. However, despite much local enthusiasm progress on establishing the museum was initially frustrated {{by the lack of}} official support to generate sufficient funds or secure suitable premises. In 1991 the Town Museum Project was launched. Over a ten-year period from 1992, {{and in the absence of}} premises, a hard-working team created a succession of thirty-eight temporary displays in a dedicated cabinet in Chesham Library. A diverse range of themes were tackled including a number on Chesham's industrial heritage; several commemorating national and local events and anniversaries; one on non-conformist churches and chapels; and a series on the renowned worthies of Chesham, including the Liberty and Lowndes families. Alongside the exhibits talks and fundraising events were organised and a Friends' newsletter produced. Despite this with only limited funds available it remained not possible to secure a permanent home for the rapidly growing collection donated by local people.In 2003 the Town Museum Project was wound up but some of the original project members joined with the publican of the Gamekeepers Lodge in Bellingdon Road who offered temporary facilities in a stable block behind the pub. The museum, located in 'The Stables', first opened to the public in 2004. Due to the limited available space, since opening in 2004, the museum adopted a rolling programme of themed temporary displays to maximise the access for visitors to as much of the collection as possible.|$|E
