500|$|Both Bevin and McConnell were {{critical}} of a February 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II that held that {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution banning same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– because {{at the end of the}} day, a lot of this ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E

In December 2010, {{he announced that he}} would donate some or all of his salary for the 2011–12 NBA season toward mental health awareness charities. Artest also auctioned off his 2009–10 championship ring and donated the proceeds to various mental health charities nationwide. In 2016, he told Sports Illustrated, [...] "Some people don’t understand mental health is broad. You have to ask questions. Are you depressed? Are you schizophrenic? Do you have anxiety? Are you bipolar? Those are the different <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> under the banner of mental health." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{began writing}} songs shortly after {{completing}} Lonerism, {{but was unable}} to specify when the album began to take shape: [...] "There’s never really a start and never really an end either." [...] The idea to compile his songs into an album came when he had between 10–20 songs ready. In May 2014, Parker spoke of his growing inclination toward recording the album in a triple J radio interview, explaining that: [...] "I'm getting more and more sucked into the world of making an album. It's weird how it happens naturally, it's almost feels like a seasonal thing. I've started to think about tracklistings and all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> with an album." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" [...] {{approach}} {{gives the}} sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to {{the dissolution of the}} thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete, abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until then}} White had been {{involved}} in all of his photography activities while still working his day job at Fleek and Neal in Newark. With all of his recent acclaim he finally decided {{he might be able to}} make a living as a photographer, and with little notice he quit his job and launched into being a professional photographer. He wrote to his friend F. Holland Day [...] "It came about this way ‒ quit at 5 p.m. and at 7:30 p.m. I was ready to start to Chicago where I'd been called by Mr. Darrow in regards [...] illustrating a book of his…I expect to do the things I've had in mind for some time, and the few <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> my way ‒ and trust to the tender mercies." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Qué Quieres Tú De Mí" [...] is an {{acoustic}} guitar ballad which Queen {{covered in a}} minor-key; it features traditional Afro-Latin American influences. It was originally written in 1964 by Brazilian composers Evaldo Gouveia and Jair Amorim as [...] "Que Queres Tu De Mim" [...] for Brazilian singer Altemar Dutra. [...] "Que Lloren" [...] features minor key tonality, bowed strings, a string ensemble and elements of techno music. The song's lyrics show a woman's view of romance and belittles the stereotype that men shouldn't show emotions. The mid-tempo [...] "Sentimientos", {{is a blend of}} reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or bachateo, a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying. It features minor key tonality, mixed acoustic and electric instrumentation, bowed strings, a string ensemble, and ambient synthesizers. Ivy Queen indicated that the song emphasized human connection over material things, stating that [...] "What I wanted to say in the song is that material things have never been important to me.... I look for genuine feelings, honesty, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from the heart, because the material things I can get." [...] In another interview, she identified the song as the one that best represented her at that time, explaining, [...] "if you think you can only conquer me if you're famous, rich and have an expensive car, you're wrong, because I'm a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for me, to bring me flowers and sing to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sentimientos", {{the title}} track, {{was written by}} Ivy Queen herself. The song was {{recorded}} at Marroneo Studios in Bayamón, Puerto Rico along with [...] "Indecisiones" [...] and [...] "En Que Fallamos" [...] from the album. It was produced by the Puerto Rican reggaetón producer and long time collaborator Rafi Mercenario, who also has produced some of her biggest hits including [...] "Cuéntale" [...] and [...] "Libertad" [...] among others. The song {{is a blend of}} reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or bachateo, a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying.

[...] After the commercial success of the album, which was certified Platinum by the United States Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), a platinum edition and substantial live album was distributed by Univision and Machete in late-2007 and 2008 respectively. The platinum edition of the album features remixes and bonus tracks to the original version of the album. Randy, who Queen is good friends with, of the duo Jowell & Randy is credited as being featured on the track that has a duration of two minutes and 49 second, [...] three seconds less than the original. However, Randy is not heard on the song.|$|E

60|$|One need {{have no fear}} of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> {{round in}} the night.
