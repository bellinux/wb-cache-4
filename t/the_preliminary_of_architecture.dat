On the other hand, another requirement is to support end-to-end network service provisioning across multiple VONs comprising different transport (e. g. Flexi-grid DWDM OCS, OPS, etc) and control plane technologies (e. g., centralized OpenFlow or distributed GMPLS).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the EU-FP 7 SCOUT project, RECOVER is a subsystem that enables a satellite infrastructure, and more specifically the ground control segment, with traffic control capabilities. Basically, RECOVER applies rules (forward, drop, re-route) to traffic flows. In this paper, we discuss <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RECOVER subsystem. The design is based on SDN, a novel approach for computer networking that allows network administrators to manage network services through the abstraction of higher-level functionalities. The core of the subsystem is a new traffic control application that provides policy-based secure routing, i. e., the ability to take on routing decisions driven by physical or network security targets...|$|R

A Pilot is a collaborative effort that applies open standards for interoperability to achieve user objectives in an environment representative of operational use. Outcomes include best-practices and interoperability arrangements suitable for an operational capability. An aim of the Pilot is to reach consensus on architectural elements that initiatives supporting geospatial information systems can carry forward into operations, thereby increasing the overall level of interoperability.

This {{study is a}} collaboration effort between Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). After launch when the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, the spacecraft typically executes a number of mission-critical operations prior to the deployment of solar panels and the activation of the primary communication subsystem. JPL, GSFC, and APL have similar design principle statements that require continuous coverage of mission-critical telemetry during the immediate post-separation phase. To conform to these design principles, an <b>architecture</b> that consists <b>of</b> a separate spacecraft transmitter and a robust communication network capable of tracking the spacecraft signals is needed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework aimed at supporting {{the decision-making process}} for <b>the</b> <b>preliminary</b> design <b>of</b> system <b>architectures</b> for the extraction of spatially and temporally distributed resources. The goal of the research {{is to provide a}} tool to identify “global best ” architectures for resource extraction “systems of systems, ” which usually differ from the sum of “local best ” systems. The framework presented in this paper consists of an integrated model where both the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the system of systems and the design of the individual systems are considered simultaneously. Using this approach, designers are able to gain insights by generating a selection of top-performing concepts. Subsequently, they can analyze those concepts using more sophisticated, albeit more resource-expensive design processes. The imple-mentation of the proposed framework is a complementary tool to existing design practices. It features several advantages such as enabling the analysis of large-scale problems, for which exhaustive enumera-tion <b>of</b> <b>architectures</b> <b>of</b> systems of systems is not a viable option. The paper first {{presents a}}n application of the methodology to the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> offshore oil and gas production fields. It then shows how to use the methodology for the development of scenario analyses. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
