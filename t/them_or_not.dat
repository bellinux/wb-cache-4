5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E

25|$|The Prime Minister's {{power to}} {{determine}} the election date can give the government some subtle advantages. For example, if governing parties believe that {{a section of the}} population will either vote against <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> at all, they might hold the election in early spring, when the weather may well keep less-committed voters away from the polls. Party strategists take the timing of important rugby union matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the election will likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a widespread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the All Blacks (the New Zealand national rugby team) win and suffer when they lose.|$|E
500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's {{family members}} to devote some {{publishing}} rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars {{if you can get}} up and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lander looked relieved, and she said, as if {{a little}} surprised, [...] "I'm glad you feel that way; I should feel just so, myself. I mean to do by you just what I always said I should. I sha'n't forget you, but whe'e the'e's so much I got to thinkin' the'e'd ought to some of it go to his folks, whetha he ca'ed for <b>'em</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> It's worried me some, and I guess if {{anything}} it's that that's made me wo'se lately." ...|$|R

Whether the other young lady was with <b>'em</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> and if so for how long, I--can't--say. There is things, Mr. Trewillian, which one can't see." ...|$|R

500|$|Chinga, the titular evil doll, {{was created}} by sewing {{together}} various doll parts. An oversized doll's head {{was placed on the}} finished body and [...] "the world's largest wig" [...] adorned its head. Props master Ken Hawryliw later reported that the hairpiece was actually the result of several wigs being sewn together. Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala, who [...] "appreciate the chance to create these classics for a Stephen King project". The [...] "Death Under Glass" [...] scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post-production via a computer. Special effects supervisor Laurie Kellsen-George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven-year-old sons, explaining that [...] "I gauge a lot of the show by whether my kids can stand <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> If they can't, I figure I succeeded [...] 'Chinga' bothered them a lot." [...] Reportedly, during the self-mutilation scene in the supermarket, a real customer who had wandered onto the set saw the commotion and left in a panic.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper {{reaction}} to the result was generally along partisan lines. [...] The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, [...] "And {{this is the man}} against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." [...] The Blade, another Republican paper, agreed, writing, [...] "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Silver Democratic paper, argued, [...] "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy... Their fight was... against the chairman of the national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to a pitiful majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." [...] Hearst's New York Journal noted, [...] "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Perhaps it is best to have him in the open." ...|$|E

2500|$|Psychotherapies and {{medications}} form {{a part of}} {{the overall}} context of mental health services and psychosocial needs related to BPD. The evidence base is limited for both, and some individuals may forego <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> benefit (enough) from them. It has been argued that diagnostic categorization can have limited utility in directing therapeutic work in this area, and that in some cases it is only with reference to past and current relationships that [...] "borderline" [...] behavior can be understood as partly adaptive and how people can best be helped.|$|E
2500|$|When {{there are}} {{multiple}} [...] "official" [...] works or original media, {{the question of what}} is and what is not canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of Star Trek and Star Wars), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of Star Wars before the franchise was purchased by Disney), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities universe, but not across <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the 2009 Star Trek film, because {{of the ways in which}} it influences the viewer experience.|$|E

2500|$|HR {{holds that}} the {{therapeutic}} [...] "working through" [...] of personal issues from the past to achieve wholeness is unnecessary. According to the HR model, people are already whole and healthy. The traumas of the past are only important {{to the extent that}} the individual lets them influence his or her thoughts in the present. According to HR, one's [...] "issues" [...] and memories are just thoughts, and the individual can react to <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> The more the clients' experience is that they themselves are creating their own painful feelings via their own [...] "power of Thought," [...] HR suggests, the less these feelings bother them. Sedgeman has compared this to what happens when we make scary faces at ourselves in the mirror: because we know it is just us, it is impossible to scare ourselves that way.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzroy Maclean {{discussed}} Yugoslavia with Churchill in Cairo {{after the}} Tehran Conference. Maclean reported that [...] "…the Partisans, whether we helped <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> {{would be the}} decisive political factor in Jugoslavia after the war and, secondly that Tito and the other leaders of the movement were openly and avowedly Communist and that the system which they would establish would inevitably be on Soviet lines and, in all probability, strongly oriented towards the Soviet Union." [...] Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: [...] "… the less you and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better. That {{is for them to}} decide. What interests us is, which of them is doing most harm to the Germans." [...] However, Maclean had also noticed Tito's [...] "independence of mind" [...] and wondered whether Tito might evolve into something more than a Soviet puppet.|$|E
2500|$|Gower briefly toured Florida, {{where he}} {{wrestled}} on television as [...] "Adrian Steele", {{and where he}} was first given the name Steve [...] "The Brawler" [...] Lawler. Gower would also fill in for masked wrestlers, most notably The Flame. He soon formed a tag team with [...] "Cowboy" [...] Dennis Gale and traveled to various NWA territories and [...] "outlaw" [...] promotions in the South and East Coast. He later claimed that many opponents would refuse to wrestle <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> show up at all, because of their stiff wrestling style. Charlie Smith, a popular Georgia wrestler in the 1960s and 1970s, once {{told him he was}} [...] "the only man he'd ever known who would go to jail for the business". Meeting with Buddy Landell in Atlanta during the mid-1980s, Landell offered to bring him in to WCW but Gower declined not willing to be under contract to the organization.

2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with <b>them</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher.
