5|$|Mishmar HaEmek {{is one of}} {{the richest}} of the kibbutzim in Israel. It is based on a socialist {{structure}} where all assets are communally owned and all residents earn <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The economy is also based on intensive farming, including field crops, orchards, dairy cattle and poultry.|$|E
5|$|The kibbutz owns 75% of Tama (Mishmar HaEmek Industries). It {{operates}} a factory on its grounds {{in partnership with}} Kibbutz Gal'ed, which owns 25% of the company.). In 2015 {{it was estimated that}} the company had an annual sales revenue of 1.5 Billion NIS. The factory has about 250 workers, over a quarter are residents of the kibbutz, and manufactures plastic netting used for bundling crops. Tama {{is one of the biggest}} players in the worldwide market for this product and works with equipment makers such as John Deere. It has factories in three countries with a total number of 900 workers. In the factory the employees and executives who are residents of the kibbutz all earn <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> while the non-kibbutz residents who are employed in the factory earn according to their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E

Both players would make <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in 2010, but while Burrell {{would be at the}} end of his contract following the conclusion of the season, Bradley was owed $13 million in 2011, a price the Rays were not willing to take on all of. Unable to make an agreement on how to split the cost, the Cubs eventually sent Bradley to the Seattle Mariners on December 18, 2009.|$|E

Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal.

25|$|On July 8, 2014, {{at around}} 13:30, National Security Agency {{operatives}} {{carried out a}} raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia without a warrant. Five NSA operatives burst into a hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes. Cash {{in the amount of}} US$247,500 and other possessions including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards were seized by the NSA. Earlier {{on the day of the}} raid, at 11:00 am, the Korean businessmen had withdrawn <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> seized from the Sinkor, Old Road branch of the International Bank of Liberia and then gone directly to the City King Hotel, expecting to complete the transaction with Aly.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 Alfredo Binda won {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} stages {{on the way}} to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire— <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> the winner of the Giro would get— not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.|$|E
25|$|A nine-point game {{is another}} variant of match play {{typically}} played among threesomes, where each hole {{is worth a}} total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format {{can be used to}} wager on the game systematically; players each contribute <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the pot, and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{preparing}} and filing all business and {{personal income tax}} returns {{is estimated to be}} $250–$300 billion each year. Approximately <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was estimated for calculating the tax implications of business decisions. That means approximately $500 to $600 billion was spent in the process of collecting roughly four times as much in taxes. According to a 2005 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the efficiency cost of the current tax system—the output that is lost over and above the tax itself—is between $240 billion and $600 billion every year. Supporters argue that the FairTax system would reduce these compliance and efficiency costs by 90% and return a larger share of that money to the productive economy. With the FairTax system, the cost of compliance would be built into the tax by allowing the business and the State to keep 1/4 of 1% of taxes collected. A 2007 study by the Beacon Hill Institute found that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system {{from the point of view}} of the administration, collection, and filing costs.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E

500|$|Lucas's {{choice of}} {{background}} music {{was crucial to}} the mood of each scene, but he was realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for sound-alikes. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> This was acceptable {{to most of the}} companies representing Lucas's first choices, but not to RCA—with the consequence that Elvis Presley is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Clearing the music licensing rights had cost approximately $90,000, and as a result there was no money left for a traditional film score. [...] "I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama," [...] Lucas later explained.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, her {{brothers}} {{served in the}} armed forces, alleviating one of her monetary worries. Her husband, meanwhile, served in the Home Guard, besides continuing as a barrister. As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer's books. To meet their expenses Heyer sold the Commonwealth rights for These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, and Regency Buck to her publisher, Heinemann, for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> she was paid. Heyer {{refused to accept the}} deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights. Heyer also reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2guineas for each review, and she allowed her novels to be serialized in Women's Journal prior to their publication as hardcover books. The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they [...] "always like my worst work".|$|E

[...] It was shown that the amount of money paid by ABC to teams appearing on television was established by Thomas C. Hansen, the NCAA Television Program Director. [...] Universities were not allowed to negotiate their own terms. Burciaga pointed out an example of the control and price fixing by noting that in 1981, Oklahoma and the University of Southern California (both then ranked in the top 5 of the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll) appeared on 200 stations in a regional broadcast. [...] On the same weekend, ABC televised a game between The Citadel and Appalachian State on four stations.

Unfortunately, only a few were produced and those were considered [...] "prototypes".
