5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question be raised in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E

25|$|By early 1923, the {{offensive}} {{capability of the}} Anti-Treaty IRA had been seriously eroded and when, in February 1923, the Republican leader Liam Deasy was captured by Free State forces, he called on <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>to</b> end their campaign and reach an accommodation with the Free State.

25|$|In many states, {{officials}} {{were reluctant to}} use black militia against the Klan {{out of fear that}} racial tensions would be raised. Republican Governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions led to white Democratic legislators' impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons were numerous.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalists {{began to}} further erode the Republican territory, {{starving}} Madrid and making inroads into the east.

25|$|The Dutch side said {{it would}} accept these {{proposals}} if the Republicans accepted them and its original 12 proposals by the 12 January deadline. After a 48-hour extension to the deadline and discussions to clarify the Dutch proposals, Dr Frank Graham, the US member of the CGO convinced <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> accept, saying they could rely on the US using its influence to ensure the Dutch kept to {{their side of the}} bargain. The Indonesian side also felt that referendums in the regions would result in victory for the pro-Republicans and that {{they would be able to}} dominate the federal government. Graham also told Amir Sjarifuddin that the US would provide aid to help rebuild a free Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Events soon removed much of {{the basis}} for the split in the women's movement. In 1870, debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made {{irrelevant}} when that amendment was officially ratified. In 1872, disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers from <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> the short-lived Liberal Republican Party. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more exclusively on women's suffrage rather than a variety of women's issues. The rivalry between the two women's groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible for twenty years. The AWSA, which was especially strong in New England, was the larger of the two organizations, but it began to decline in strength during the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the League was announced in Washington, D.C., on August 22, 1934, {{by a group of}} Democrats and a smaller number of Republicans. Jouett Shouse, who had been prominent in Democratic politics and the anti-Prohibition movement, became the group's first chairman. The makeup of the League's executive committee was designed to demonstrate its bipartisan nature. It included: John W. Davis and Al Smith, former Democratic candidates for president; wealthy businessman IrÃ©nÃ©e du Pont, who left <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> support Al Smith in 1928 and Roosevelt in 1932; and two New York Republicans, Nathan L. Miller, the state's former governor, and Representative James W. Wadsworth. The moving spirit behind the launch of the organization was John Jacob Raskob, {{a former chairman of the}} Democratic National Committee and the foremost opponent of Prohibition, former director of General Motors and a board member of the DuPont.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the coup}} failed, {{the death of}} the King and heir {{apparent}} was responsible for continuing instability which was ultimately a success for the republicans. The traditional parties were able to impose an acclamation solution, with the establishment of a unity government presided by an independent (Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral), the ostracising of JoÃ£o Franco's supporters, and the repeal of Francist decrees. In fact, the acclamation policies was a rendition: many of the conspirators were liberated from prison, the assassins (who were killed in the square) were eulogized as martyrs and the criminal investigation was rendered ineffective. These events only encouraged <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>to</b> attempt another coup d'Ã©tat 33 months later, led by the same people, that would succeed in establishing the Portuguese First Republic. The events that gave rise to the attempted coup on January 28 were the last attempts to reform the constitutional monarchy.|$|E
25|$|At the 1968 Republican state convention, Whitcomb competed {{to win the}} {{nomination}} for governor against Indiana House of Representatives minority leader Otis R. Bowen and future Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. Backed by the party leaders of several large counties, Whitcomb overcame Bowen and Butz to secure {{the nomination}}. Bowen, after being nominated for governor in 1972, advocated the nomination of candidates for governor and US Senator by primary elections. Whitcomb's opponent in the general election was Democratic candidate Robert L. Rock, and the campaign focused largely on tax policy and national issues. Although Democrats had taken strong majorities in the state government in the past two elections, the 1968 election returned <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> power, giving them strong majorities in the General Assembly, and a win in all the congressional and statewide elections, except one. Whitcomb was among the benefactors of the cycle and took office on January 13, 1969.|$|E
25|$|President Harry S. Truman {{vetoed the}} Act, but enough Democrats joined with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> {{override}} the Presidential veto on June 23, 1947. It {{is in the}} platform of all major U.S. labor unions to call for {{the repeal of the}} Act, especially Section 14 (b), and at times this has been reflected in the platform of the Democratic Party. However, the only time this has ever seemed likely was when the Democrats had a huge majority in both houses of Congress following the Republican electoral disaster of 1964. Even then, the repeal bill passed 221â€“203 in the House, but the two-thirds majority it needed in the Senate was never attained, partly because of long filibustering by Republicans such as Minority leader Everett Dirksen. Labor allies failed to break the filibuster, and the repeal bill was finally put to rest by the Montana Democrat Majority leader, Mike Mansfield, on February 10, 1966.|$|E

25|$|President James Buchanan {{decided to}} end the {{troubles}} in Kansas by urging Congress to admit Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. Kansas voters, however, soundly rejected this constitutionâ€”at least {{with a measure of}} widespread fraud on both sidesâ€”by more than 10,000 votes. As Buchanan directed his presidential authority to this goal, he further angered the Republicans and alienated members of his own party. Prompting their break with the administration, the Douglasites saw this scheme as an attempt to pervert the principle of popular sovereignty on which the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act was based. Nationwide, conservatives were incensed, feeling as though the principles of states' rights had been violated. Even in the South, ex-Whigs and border states Know-Nothingsâ€”most notably John Bell and John J. Crittenden (key figures in the event of sectional controversies)â€”urged <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> oppose the administration's moves and take up the demand that the territories be given the power to accept or reject sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, County Executive Andrew Spano became {{just the}} second Democrat {{to hold the}} post {{in at least a}} half-century. In 2006, county {{legislator}} Andrea Stewart-Cousins defeated 20-year incumbent Nicholas Spano for a seat in the New York State Senate in a rematch of the 2004 race, which she had lost by only 18 votes. His brother, Assembly Member Mike Spano, switched parties in July 2007 to become a Democrat. Current district attorney Janet DiFiore also switched parties from Republican to Democrat in August 2007. In 2009, Republican Rob Astorino ousted three-term county executive Andy Spano, who had the endorsement of the New York Conservative Party, winning in a landslide. Astorino became the first Republican county executive since Andrew O'Rourke left the post in 1997. In 2011, the GOP broke the Democratic two-thirds majority in the county legislature by picking up two seats. The current composition is ten Democrats, six Republicans, and one Conservative who caucuses with the Republicans. However, two of the Democrats formed a coalition with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> control the board, with a Republican becoming vice-chair.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic and Royal Army, {{numbering}} 50,000, including 30,000â€“35,000 fighting men, elected La Rochjaquelein {{as their}} leader. They hoped to recruit Bretons to their cause, but {{the local people}} stayed home. The Vendeans moved to Laval with the Army of the West in pursuit. LÃ©chelle quickly proved incapable of leading an army. After passing through ChÃ¢teau-Gontier on 25 October, the Republican advance guard under Westermann blundered into a Vendean ambush south of Laval and was driven back. Though both KlÃ©ber and Marceau advised caution, LÃ©chelle and the representatives insisted on an advance the next day. Unwisely, LÃ©chelle ordered that the 25,000-man army march to battle in a single column. The next morning, Beaupuy and Marceau encountered the rebels near Entrammes. KlÃ©ber soon brought his division into the fight, but with the army strung out on a single road it proved difficult for <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> get more troops into action. In fact LÃ©chelle remained in the rear during the entire battle and failed to commit the reserve. Led by La Rochejaquelein and Royrand in the center, the Vendeans forced back the Republicans, turning captured cannon against their former owners. After another rebel force hit them in flank, the Republican soldiers began to flee. In the Battle of Entrames on 26 October the Vendeans dispersed the Army of the West inflicting very heavy losses and capturing 19 cannons.|$|E
