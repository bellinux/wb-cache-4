5000|$|After {{writing a}} series of action pulp novels in the 1960s under the pseudonyms Neil Egri and Mort Gillian, in 1970 Gilmore {{published}} The Tucson Murders, <b>through</b> <b>Dial</b> Press, New York, a hardcover nonfiction true crime detailing the life and crimes of Charles Schmid, the [...] "notorious pied piper of Tucson".|$|R
50|$|The Calibre 36 {{movement}} is cased within a steel-tube housing {{that can be}} seen <b>through</b> the <b>dial</b> face. The watch is constructed in industrial-grade tungsten.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, MB&F {{presented}} Legacy Machine No.2, {{which features}} two flying balance wheels suspended over the dial. A raised (visible <b>through</b> the <b>dial</b> at 6 o'clock) planetary differential transmits {{the average rate}} of the two regulators to a single gear train.|$|R
30|$|Population controls, {{identified}} <b>through</b> random-digit <b>dialing,</b> were frequency-matched on race/ethnicity and 5 -year {{age group}} (John et al. 2003). Of 3, 170 eligible controls, 2, 706 (85 %) completed the in-person interview, including 1, 462 (88 %) Hispanics, 598 (82 %) AAs, and 646 (83 %) NHWs.|$|R
60|$|A smile {{crossed his}} lips. With {{a pair of}} cutters he snipped off the {{projection}} which extended <b>through</b> the <b>dial</b> from the external pointer--now the latter might be moved to any point upon the dial without affecting the mechanism below. In other words, the eastern hemisphere dial was useless.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{platform that}} made the Eco-Drive concept possible was the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement. This movement was the first light powered movement where the solar cells could be mounted under the dial. Previous light powered watches from Citizen and other manufacturers had the solar cell(s) mounted directly on the dial.This innovation was enabled by marked improvements in thin film amorphous silicon solar cells, which, by the early 1990s had become significantly more efficient. By locating a sufficiently translucent dial material over the now more efficient solar cells, enough light could pass <b>through</b> the <b>dial</b> face to power the movement. Though the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement solar cells remained slightly visible <b>through</b> the <b>dial,</b> the physical styling of the light-powered watch was no longer constrained by visible solar cells.|$|R
50|$|After 2 March 2003, direct {{international}} {{calls from}} the Republic of Cyprus to Turkey are possible and now callers from the Republic of Cyprus can call Northern Cyprus <b>through</b> Turkey <b>dialling</b> 0090 392 xxxxxxx as well as using 0139 (although in this case calls will be charged at international rates).|$|R
5000|$|Jones Radio Networks was {{purchased}} by Triton Media Group, and [...] "Good Time Oldies" [...] was merged to Dial Global's [...] "Kool Gold" [...] network and then quickly brought back as Good Time Oldies due to affiliate demand. It is also available <b>through</b> the <b>Dial</b> Global [...] "local" [...] division as well.|$|R
50|$|There is {{phone service}} with direct dialed in Concepción City, Horqueta and Yby Yaú; in Belén and Loreto {{the service is}} with <b>dialing</b> <b>through</b> an operator.|$|R
50|$|Partners Skype and Telehop offer long {{distance}} services for Telus Mobility customers. The first service uses Voice over IP (VoIP) and requires a mobile broadband connection, {{while the latter}} uses traditional telephony <b>through</b> the <b>dialing</b> code #100. The Telehop service, which deducts minutes when used during weekdays, cannot be use for calls terminating in Canada or the United States.|$|R
50|$|In the book, Jake and {{the others}} {{discover}} {{the existence of the}} clinic <b>through</b> Tom <b>dialling</b> various doctors at home and at a meeting for the Sharing. In the TV series, he learns about the clinic through his parents and their meeting with Visser Three/Victor Trent. Jake's dad is later found out to be involved in running the clinic in the TV series.|$|R
5000|$|The dial was {{the first}} force {{feedback}} steering wheel available on the PlayStation. Its name {{was derived from the}} action of [...] "jogging" [...] a dial like those found on some VCRs and the action of putting this on a controller. Actions such as torque steer, collisions, and feedback from turning the automobile all can be felt <b>through</b> the <b>dial</b> as the player manipulates it to maneuver their vehicle through the course.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of bearing preloads on the characteristics of spindle stiffness. Finite element model for spindle-bearing system is established enabling the variation of spindle stiffness calculations under different bearing preloads. On the other hand, the spindle stiffness may also be obtained from the experiment and its result may be utilized to validate the numerical calculations. The front-end section of spindle is acted by poise weights at different directions, and their corresponding deformations are measured <b>through</b> <b>dial</b> indicator. Three bearing preload conditions, i. e. light, medium and heavy preloads are selected, which are imposed on the bearing to investigate the spindle stiffness variation, respectively. In addition, the effects of the geometrical parallelism error at the end surfaces of spacer due to the manufacturing tolerance or some imperfection on the spindle stiffness are studied. Finally, the impact test on the spindle-bearing body is performed by hammer and the corresponding vibration signal on the spindle surfaces is acquired by accelerometer. The spindle stiffness may be reflected in the other manner through the signals processing by spectrum analysis...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the Marin 2 Thalassa was {{launched}} featuring a hand-wound {{version of the}} SM2, the SM2m - ‘m’ standing for manual-winding. The Thalassa features a blue-steel outer dial incorporating a date window, and open inner <b>dial</b> <b>through</b> which the hand-finished movement is visible.|$|R
50|$|A third {{research}} project {{was that of}} listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience - this was dubbed the Little Annie Project. The official name was the Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer. This allowed one not {{only to find out}} if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, <b>through</b> a <b>dial</b> which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} known examples are emergency telephone numbers such as 9-9-9, 1-1-2 and 9-1-1. Other services {{may also be}} available <b>through</b> abbreviated <b>dialing</b> numbers, such as the other of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) besides 9-1-1. State highway departments {{in recent years have}} used abbreviated dialing codes to allow drivers to obtain information about road conditions or to reach the state highway patrol. Examples are *55 in Missouri and Oklahoma, or *FHP which connects to the Florida Highway Patrol.|$|R
50|$|After March 2, 2003 direct {{international}} {{calls from}} Northern Cyprus to Turkey are possible and now callers from Cyprus can call Northern Cyprus <b>through</b> Turkey by <b>dialling</b> 0090 392 xxxxxxx as well by using 0139 (although {{in these cases}} calls will be charged at international rates).|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{system is}} to use a lens with fixed focus set at the hyperfocal distance. This will produce images that are acceptably sharp from infinity to some near plane (usually five to eight feet away). This system is used in most cheaper cameras.More complex systems allow variable focus, <b>through</b> a <b>dial</b> or slider. Many cameras with this system have distance markings on the control; {{it is up to the}} user to set the focus according to the distance to the subject. Most Minox cameras use this system.|$|R
5000|$|GETS is {{accessed}} <b>through</b> a <b>dialing</b> {{plan and}} Personal Identification Number (PIN) card verification system. Using common telephone equipment, the user dials a universal access number: [...] (...) [...] A prompt directs {{the entry of}} the user’s assigned twelve-digit PIN and the destination telephone number. Once the user is authenticated as valid, his or her call receives special treatment. When dealing with GETS User Assistance, users may need to provide a registered password of 4 to 9 alphanumeric characters for those cards issued to an individual rather than through stockpile.|$|R
5000|$|The guiding visual thread <b>through</b> <b>Dial</b> H-I-S-T-O-R-Y is {{an almost}} {{exhaustive}} chronology of airplane hijackings in the world. From Raffaele Minichiello, the first transatlantic hijacker (1969), to an anonymous and dying terrorist in St. Petersburg (1993), Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y charts a history of airplane hijacking, and illustrates how, as hijackers got progressively more television coverage, they {{became more and more}} deadly. In this sense, the underlying theme is that the hijack was becoming itself hijacked by news media corporations. Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y suggests that hijackers and television evolved a deadly symbiosis: on the one hand, with their protracted duration, hijackings allowed for enough time to the television cameras to be set up. The nature of live television allowed for a minute-by-minute update of the hijack as the situation progressed; this blurred the line between entertainment and tragedy. [...] Television coverage stressed the extraordinary nature of the unfolding events (first transatlantic hijack, first live TV broadcast of a hijack, first attack on a skyjacked plane, etc.) as the only material suitable for television. [...] On the other hand, for terrorists seeking to inscribe their struggle in history, the hijack devoid of the mediatized image of itself lost all of its communicative power. With the airplane always on the move between countries and borders as if belonging nowhere, the hijack came to symbolize the transgression across a violent border towards a political utopia.|$|R
50|$|The iPhone 4 {{supports}} video calling {{using either}} the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls FaceTime. Voice control, {{introduced in the}} iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it. The first two models only support voice <b>dialing</b> <b>through</b> third-party applications.|$|R

40|$|An {{interview}} {{case-control study}} was undertaken {{to search for}} risk factors for Ewing’s sarcoma. The 208 cases, aged 5 months to 22 years at diagnosis and all white but one, were identified from hospitals participating in the Intergroup Ewing’s Sarcoma Study therapeutic trials. Two controls were sought for each case: a sibling control and an age-matched regional population control identified <b>through</b> random-digit <b>dialing</b> telephone procedures. A questionnaire was administered {{to the parents of}} cases and controls. Parents {{were more likely to have}} smoked during the pregnancy with the case than during the pregnancy with the unaffected sibling.

50|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed suit}} such as secondly PT Indointernet led by Mr. Sanjaya. However, Indonet started its operations at Jakarta in 1994 {{before the government}} began issuing licenses for ISP operations. Indonet initiated its internet connectivity with a 9600 bit/s modem <b>dialing</b> <b>through</b> IDD to Singapore. Through this connection, TELNET and IRC services were available freely to anyone with a modem.|$|R
50|$|The SIP URI {{scheme is}} a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{multimedia}} communications protocol. A SIP address is a URI that addresses a specific telephone extension on a voice over IP system. Such a number {{could be a}} private branch exchange or an E.164 telephone number <b>dialled</b> <b>through</b> a specific gateway. The scheme was defined in RFC 3261.|$|R
50|$|The {{other main}} theme is Defever's {{memories}} of AM radio {{and being a}} youth in the 1970s, and the songs both reflect {{the sound of the}} decade's AM radio fare and are filled with memories of Michigan winters, summers and locations. There are several musical interludes that give the impression of turning <b>through</b> a radio <b>dial,</b> including snippets of songs that later appear in full.|$|R
50|$|Until Montenegro gained {{independence}} from Serbia and Montenegro, {{the nation was}} accessed <b>through</b> the international <b>dialing</b> code +381. The new dialing code +382 was introduced after independence and the two codes were used in parallel until February 2007, when +382 nominally became the only acceptable code. As of 1 October 2007, +381 is used only for Serbia and +382 is the only acceptable code for Montenegro.|$|R

50|$|Designs range {{widely in}} power, speed, and features, from less {{powerful}} portable, handheld models {{that are usually}} shaped like a cordless drill, to high-power, high-speed, corded models designed for heavy construction and demolition work. Modern reciprocating saws almost all have variable speed, either through trigger sensitivity or <b>through</b> a <b>dial.</b> Another feature that has become important to the way these saws are used is the inclusion of an orbital action. This action consists of oscillating the traversed reciprocation in up and down fashion (perpendicular to the motion of cut) causing {{the tip of the}} blade to move in an oval pattern, up and down as well as back and forth. This feature is primarily for wood, allowing quick cuts.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of endometrial cancer is largely related to prolonged exposure to unopposed estro-gens. Phytoestrogens (i. e., weak estrogens found in plant foods) may have antiestrogenic effects. We evaluated the associations between dietary intake of seven specific com-pounds representing three classes of phytoestrogens (isofla-vones, coumestans, and lignans) {{and the risk}} of endometrial cancer. Methods: In a case–control study from the greater San Francisco Bay Area, we collected dietary information from 500 African American, Latina, and white women aged 35 – 79 years who were diagnosed with endometrial cancer be-tween 1996 and 1999 and from 470 age- and ethnicity-matched control women identified <b>through</b> random-digit <b>dialing.</b> Un-conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) ...|$|R
50|$|When Hurricane Sandy made {{landfall}} in New Jersey on October 29, 2012, {{the effects}} of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey were severe, and Mantoloking was especially hard hit, with more than 50 homes requiring demolition, accounting for almost 10% of the housing units in the borough as of the 2010 Census. Verizon Communications announced in July 2013 that it won't rebuild its copper-wire based {{plain old telephone service}} to Mantoloking residents, instead providing them with its Voice Link wireless service, an effort that brought protests from the AARP. Residents have complained that many calls don't go <b>through</b> when <b>dialed,</b> that fax transmissions can't be made, that 911 calls may be affected by network bottlenecks and that power outages would result in the loss of service.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour — this wheel has a shaft that goes <b>through</b> the <b>dial.</b> On the dial side the cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} cannon pinion. The cannon pinion drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|R
