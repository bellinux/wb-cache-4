Our paths crossed in 2006 and, since then, their encouragement and support of the work we do at the National Vaccine Information Center has kept the organized vaccine safety and informed consent movement, which was launched in 1982 by parents of vaccine injured children, going strong. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> all <b>you</b> have done to advance truth in science and protect the right to informed consent to vaccination. We have come to Jamaica to evaluate vaccine safety science because there is a crisis upon us. This crisis is fueled by a loss of public trust in what many doctors tell people about the safety of vaccines and the risks of infectious diseases.
