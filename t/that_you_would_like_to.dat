6000|$|You {{recently}} have said, I hear, [...] <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go To serve as Senator. That's queer! [...] Have you told William Stow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} wish mean?" [...] she asked. [...] "Do you mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> agree with me, {{or would you}} like to be twenty-nine?" ...|$|E
500|$|How is it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> me {{to leave}} so many goods behind? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Hawtrey, I <b>would</b> ask <b>you</b> a question. Has it ever entered {{your mind}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> Ned Hampton as a son-in-law?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said, {{speaking}} for your friend, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{could tell me}} how to do something useful and good. Something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> done, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If, at any time," [...] {{he said to}} A. v. d. R., [...] "you feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> reconsider your answer, send me a rose like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This other gentleman," [...] {{observed}} Joe, by way {{of introducing}} Mr. Wopsle, [...] "is a gentleman <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear give it out. Our clerk at church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am at ease again. Is there {{anything}} more <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> ask me?" [...] she said, with {{the matter of}} a queen rather than of a mother.|$|E
6000|$|MR. BARLOW. If <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be so kind. (Exit OLIVER.) Can't {{you find}} a sweet <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> my dear? Won't you take a little cherry brandy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As much so as possible; {{they have}} hardly a way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> my dear ma'am; and are as close-mouthed {{as if they}} were afraid of {{committing}} themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were saying," [...] he said, {{addressing}} {{himself to}} Gip, [...] "before <b>you</b> came in, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{one of our}} 'Buy One and Astonish your Friends' boxes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That sounds quite absurd," [...] she answered. [...] "Yet {{it is my}} last evening, and I think--if you {{are sure}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have me--that I will risk it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I suppose," [...] she said, {{her face}} turned up towards him, {{but her eyes}} cast down, [...] "that {{you are going to}} say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Funny thing," [...] Mr. Merrill continued, [...] "I {{was looking}} for you, Duncan. It {{occurred}} to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> meet Mr. Wetherell. I was afraid you were in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>that</b> means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{him very}} much," [...] laughed Farmer Brown's boy. [...] "Do {{you think you}} can catch him if I let him out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I will," [...] said I; [...] "why {{did you not}} ring, {{and let me know}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> fresh air? But I {{shall see}} to it to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{word from}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{go a long way}} with her,--as it ought. If she knows <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> her to marry her cousin, it will make her think it her duty--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s what he says," [...] replied Miss Drewitt, {{taking a}} low {{chair by the}} captain’s side and gazing composedly at the intruder. [...] "I told him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't yet--that is to say, we {{are still}} at the table," [...] he remarked, as he {{followed}} me; [...] "but {{if there is anything}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have, I should be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{gentleman from}} Virginia {{who has lost}} his elder brother and {{absolutely}} regrets him. The breed ain't known in this country. Upon my honour and conscience, I believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have him back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with {{a sharper}} note, [...] "you don't {{mean to say}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> him to turn public man in that way--making a sort of {{political}} Cheap Jack of himself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very happy to. It will give me very great pleasure, Charley. Let me think what I have of hers <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like.</b> But {{come with me to}} the house, and I'll see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{me to go}} to London for you, {{and search}} through your uncle's effects?" [...] Deane asked quietly. [...] "If you gave me a letter, I suppose I could do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! no!" [...] he said. [...] "I will {{fetch the}} drawing myself." [...] He turned gayly to Winterfield. [...] "Prepare {{yourself}} for another work <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> kiss." [...] He smiled, {{and left the}} room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you were}} saying {{only a short time}} since <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> learn the harp and take lessons in painting. There would be time enough to think about what you would do with respect to this house afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whenever {{you feel}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{go down and}} have something, don't mind me, will you?" [...] she begged. [...] "You can {{come back and talk}} to me at any time. I am not in the least hungry yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{quite certain}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it," [...] said Cashel, uneasily, {{avoiding}} her eye. [...] "Hullo!" [...] he exclaimed, as {{he attempted to}} refresh himself by another look at Lydia, [...] "she's given us the slip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{the sound}} of the word better than that of Hiya, though {{afterwards}} I will teach you to pronounce it as you should, O--have you any other name save Watcher-by-Night, which seems also to be a title?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, {{handing it}} to her, [...] "the first {{woodcock}} of the season. We got four, and I really only accepted one in the hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it. I shall leave it with the estimable Mills, on my return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lord Monmouth,' said Mr. Rigby to Coningsby, 'wishes {{that you}} should beg your friends to dine with him. Of course you will ask Lord Henry and your friend Sir Charles Buckhurst; {{and is there any}} one else <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> invite?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fan, I {{know what}} you are {{thinking}} of," [...] said Miss Churton, turning to the girl. [...] "It is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go and caress the flowers again--you are such a flower-lover. Would you like to go and explore the orchard by yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Morton {{seemed to}} think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> pay a tribute of respect," [...] said the lawyer. Peter {{looked at him and}} went upstairs and packed his portmanteau. The lawyer handed over the keys to the new squire, and then {{everything}} was done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! no," [...] {{she said}} to herself, whilst aloud she murmured: [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> them. Your room has such a gloomy, sombre air, and a few roses seem to diffuse some of the {{sunshine}} on {{which they have been}} nurtured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{you think}} you are the only modest man? Papa is very modest, and he wouldn't make you an offer outright, unless he saw <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it. But I know that was what he was coming to, and if you'll let me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{so many of}} {{our young}} nobles went into Germany and Hungary, you were pleased in your wisdom to say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> well to see what reports they sent home to their friends; also what news was sent out from the court to them." ...|$|R
