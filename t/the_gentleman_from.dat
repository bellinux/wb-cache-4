25|$|Bunin and Muromtseva {{spent three}} winters (1912–1914) with Gorky {{on the island}} of Capri, where they met with Fyodor Shalyapin and Leonid Andreev, among others. In Russia the couple divided their time mainly between Moscow and a Bunin family estate at Glotovo village nearby Oryol; it was there that they spent the first couple years of World War I. Dogged by anxieties {{concerning}} Russia's future, Bunin was still working hard. In the winter of 1914–1915 he finished a new volume of prose and verse entitled The Chalice of Life (Чаша жизни), published in early 1915 to wide acclaim (including high praise from the French poet Rene Ghil). The same year saw the publication of <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> <b>from</b> San Francisco (Господин из Сан-Франциско), arguably the best-known of Bunin's short stories, which was translated into English by D. H. Lawrence. Bunin was a productive translator himself. After Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha (1898) he did translations of Byron, Tennyson, Musset and François Coppée.|$|E

500|$|The last {{decades of}} the 19th century began {{what is known as}} the [...] "golden age of Indiana literature", a period that lasted until the 1920s. Edward Eggleston [...] wrote The Hoosier Schoolmaster (1871), the first best seller to {{originate}} in the state. Many other followed, including Maurice Thompson's Hoosier Mosaics (1875), and Lew Wallace's [...] (1880). Indiana developed a reputation as the [...] "American heartland" [...] following several widely read novels beginning with Booth Tarkington's <b>The</b> <b>Gentleman</b> <b>from</b> Indiana (1899), Meredith Nicholson's The Hoosiers (1900), and Thompson's second famous novel, Alice of Old Vincennes (1900). James Whitcomb Riley, known as the [...] "Hoosier Poet" [...] and the most popular poet of his age, wrote hundreds of poems celebrating Hoosier themes, including Little Orphant Annie. A unique art culture also began developing in the late 19th century, beginning the Hoosier School of landscape painting and the Richmond Group of impressionist painters. The painters were known for their use of vivid colors and artists including T. C. Steele, whose work was influenced by the colorful hills of southern Indiana. Prominent musicians and composers from Indiana also reached national acclaim during the time, including Paul Dresser whose most popular song, [...] "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away", was later adopted as the official state song.|$|E
500|$|Numismatic {{historian}} Don Taxay {{thought it}} likely {{that members of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures had agreed to support a Hawaii half dollar prior to a bill being submitted, as preparations had already begun. Legislation for such was introduced into the House of Representatives by the territory's delegate to Congress, Victor Stewart Kaleoaloha Houston, on December 5, 1927. It was referred to the coinage committee, of which New Jersey Congressman Randolph Perkins was the chair, and which held hearings on the bill on January 23, 1928. Delegate Houston appeared in support of his bill, and to the surprise of committee members, had gotten a statement from Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, stating that Mellon did not oppose the bill. [...] Usually, when a commemorative coin was proposed, Mellon argued that a medal should be issued instead. [...] This had been the case for the Norse-American medal three years previously; its sponsor, committee member Ole J. Kvale of Minnesota, had scuttled plans for a coin because of Treasury Department opposition. Congressman Kvale was [...] "very much interested in learning what powers of persuasion have been exercised by <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii to bring out such a favorable report". Kvale, a Norse-American, asked, [...] "why this discrimination against two and a half million people in the United States has come about in favor of about 35,000 whites in that Territory?" ...|$|E
