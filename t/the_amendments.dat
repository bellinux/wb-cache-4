5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal's {{decision}} and <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> to the Constitution and the ISA which followed have sparked much academic discourse. The following {{issues have been}} raised by commentators.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} sections are <b>the</b> <b>amendments.</b> For reasons unknown, this constitution {{has never}} been directly updated since its adoption. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> are enumerated in this Article.

Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and Chancery, transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the New Jersey Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Anniversary of the 1967 {{referendum}}, 27 May – The {{anniversary of}} the 1967 referendum to amend the federal constitution has also been suggested. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> enabled the federal parliament to legislate with regard to Indigenous Australians and allowed for Indigenous Australians {{to be included in}} the national census.

50|$|Amendments are an {{important}} tool that can add nuance and perspective to debate on a particular issue, {{even though they are}} not practiced as often as they once were. To amend, a student will submit <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> in writing to the head table (often rising to a point of personal privilege and seeking permission to approach the rostrum). The presiding officer (often in consultation with the parliamentarian) will first determine if <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> is germane; or if it changes the original intent of the legislation, it is ruled dilatory. The author of <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> then moves to amend, and if the presiding officer rules it germane, they read it aloud to the chamber and calls for a one-thirds second (usually by voice vote). If one-third of the chamber concurs to consider <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> <b>the</b> presiding officer then calls for a speech in support of <b>the</b> <b>amendment.</b> At most tournaments, the speech introducing or sponsoring <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> is not guaranteed to its author, and in fact, it is common practice in some areas for a contestant to immediately move the previous question on <b>the</b> <b>amendment.</b> If that happens, it is not debated before the chamber passes or defeats <b>the</b> <b>amendment.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> passes, subsequent debate on the legislation must consider the legislation as amended.|$|R
5|$|Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned {{in favor}} of the {{proposed}} amendments. Most {{of the leaders of the}} party support him and will campaign with him. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote {{in favor of}} <b>the</b> <b>amendments.</b> Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made statements in favor of <b>the</b> <b>amendments.</b> The group, led by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F.

5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state constitutional amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, though some of <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of <b>the</b> <b>amendments,</b> and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>amendment</b> {{passed by}} a large margin. Eighty-one percent of voters {{participating}} in the election, or almost thirty-one percent of eligible voters in the state, approved <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> and nineteen percent of election participants opposed it. All 95 counties of Tennessee voted for <b>the</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the initiative, Keep Colorado Safe was formed to oppose <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> arguing that: 1) <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> would do nothing to stem the flow of illegal immigration and 2) the proponents of <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> have overstated <b>the</b> cost of providing such services.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>amendment</b> {{was adopted}} during the Fine Gael-Labour Party {{coalition}} government led by Garret FitzGerald but was drafted and first {{suggested by the}} previous Fianna Fáil government of Charles Haughey. <b>The</b> <b>amendment</b> was supported by Fianna Fáil and some of Fine Gael, and was generally opposed by the political left. Most of those opposed to <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> however, insisted {{that they were not}} in favour of legalising abortion. The Roman Catholic hierarchy supported <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> but it was opposed by the other mainstream churches. After an acrimonious referendum campaign, <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> was passed by 67% voting in favour to 33% voting against.|$|R

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
50|$|After Congress sent <b>the</b> 19th <b>Amendment</b> to <b>the</b> {{states for}} {{ratification}} in the Spring of 1919, French {{spent much of}} her time in Nashville lobbying state legislators. By the time the legislature convened in August 1920 to consider <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> thirty-five states had ratified <b>the</b> <b>amendment,</b> leaving it one state short. French and her colleagues set up headquarters in the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, and after a marathon lobbying session, the state house certified <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> on August 19, 1920, and <b>the</b> <b>amendment</b> thus became law.|$|R

2500|$|On November 2, 2004 Amendment 3 {{passed by}} a margin of 65.8% to 33.2%.

5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.|$|E
5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill may give two clear days' notice of <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E
