5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, which can include {{elements such as}} resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, <b>take</b> <b>many</b> years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E
5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, it can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation {{process can be}} accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the residual gas load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could <b>take</b> <b>many</b> years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of parental care in frigatebirds {{is among the}} longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds <b>take</b> <b>many</b> years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part <b>take</b> <b>many</b> species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E

Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{against women}} may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would <b>take</b> <b>many</b> more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E

5|$|Following this, Joan {{begins to}} gather troops {{and she takes}} her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to {{describe}} the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer the English peace, but the English decline. The French attack the English and, {{as soon as they}} start, a storm starts up and lightning flashes about them. This scares the English and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort. During the battle, the French <b>take</b> <b>many</b> captives and the generals wish to execute them. However, Joan intervenes and ensures the safety of the captives' lives.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will <b>take</b> <b>many</b> years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E
5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that <b>take</b> <b>many</b> atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required {{to pick the}} best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E

5|$|The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian {{national}} contingent {{was organized}} in traditional formations {{dating back to}} the earlier medieval times, with chorƒÖgiew (banner) unit, commanded by a rotmistrz and composed of smaller poczet (lance) retinues, each composed of one towarzysz and a varying number of aides. The size of a chorƒÖgiew could vary from as little as 60 to as many as 300 men. Two or more choragwie (through rarely more than a dozen, and never more than about forty) formed a regiment (pu≈Çk) unit, a type of a unit similar to the medieval battle or modern division or corps. Its senior commander was known as pu≈Çkownik (colonel). The foreign contingent was organized into regiments, often numbering around 500-1,000, and divided into companies. King John III Sobieski made an attempt in the 1670s to replace the national-foreign contingent divisions with a single structure, dividing units into infantry, cavalry and dragoons, but it would <b>take</b> <b>many</b> decades before those reforms bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the telegraph had resulted in a trail that could be followed for interstate travel, {{but it was a}} haphazard route which only the more adventurous motorists would <b>take.</b> <b>Many</b> travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services; they would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism. In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see the road as important enough for its involvement.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
