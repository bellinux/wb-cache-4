5|$|On March 27, the Russians {{received}} {{word about the}} earlier disastrous defeat at Wschowa. Peter I realized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of a combined attack on Charles were now minimal. He ordered Ogilvy to attempt {{an escape from the}} encirclement at Grodno and a retreat towards Brest-Litovsk. Ogilvy carried out the order on April 4 and managed to break out unseen with his reduced army, leaving 8,000 men behind at Grodno who had died of starvation and sickness. Another 9,000 men were lost during the retreat as the Swedes pursued the Russians as far as Polesia, where they finally gave up the chase. Mazepa met a similar defeat, as he sent 4,700 men in an attempt to save the Cossacks trapped inside Lyakhavichy. Instead these were annihilated in the battle of Kletsk on April 30, after which the garrison in Lyakhavichy surrendered to the Swedes on May 12 and the fortress was destroyed. In total, almost 10,000 Cossacks were killed, out of the initial 14,000 who actively participated in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|With an Ebola {{epidemic}} devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily {{meetings on}} July 28, 2014, {{as part of}} the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent further spread of the disease. Starting on September30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of a full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Four {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the effect on the}} static pressure seal of earmolds made from currently used impression and earmold materials; the occasional practice of making more than one earmold from an impression; the ear-moldmaker buildup of impressions; and the multistage buildup of impressions by the impression taker. Experiment 1 showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of sealing <b>the</b> ear with earmolds made by the ordinary two-stage technique with only general buildup of the impression was approximately 10 percent and <b>that</b> none of <b>the</b> impression or earmold materials significantly improved <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of obtaining a seal. Experiment 2 showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of obtaining a seal with multiple earmolds made from the one impression was zero, or very close to zero. Experiment 3 revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of obtaining a seal increased to 55 per-cent when the earmold was made from an impression which was specially built up by the earmoldmaker. Experiment 4 showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of sealing <b>the</b> ear with earmolds made from multistage impressions was significantly greater (87. 5 percent) than sealing the ear with those made from impressions specially built up by the earmoldmaker.

Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan's raid was {{an overall}} {{tactical}} success, having killed Jeb Stuart at Yellow Tavern and beaten Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge, all with relatively minimal casualties—about 625 {{men for the}} entire raid, compared to 800 Confederate. From a strategic standpoint, however, the raid deprived General Grant of the cavalry resources {{that would have been}} helpful at Spotsylvania Court House and his subsequent advance to the North Anna River, and there are lingering questions about whether Sheridan should have attempted to assault the city of Richmond. In the latter case, Sheridan believed {{it would not have been}} worth the risk in casualties and he recognized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of holding the city for more than a brief time would be minimal; any advantages would primarily result from damage to Confederate morale.|$|E
25|$|Justifications for harsher punishments for {{hate crimes}} {{focus on the}} notion that hate crimes cause greater {{individual}} and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.|$|E
