5|$|More {{contentious}} than <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>house</b> was {{the question}} of the upper house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>house.</b> James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10–1 by the delegates. Most delegates didn't question the intelligence of the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century.|$|E

The rooms in <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are also considered more luxurious with hardwood floors and large sizes. Rooms in <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Houses</b> are more expensive, however.

5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Maryland, Carroll {{presented}} his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new Attorney General of the colony.

5|$|The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>house,</b> {{with the}} members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a {{four-year}} term.

No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E
