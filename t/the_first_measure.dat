The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure</b> of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The song {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} {{consisting of a}} sustained measure of electronic effects followed by two lines from the chorus. In each two-measure line {{during the first half}} of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the off-beats of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure</b> and the electric bass opens the line with a two-note bassline. During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are overdubbed, and the instrumentation becomes more frequent. Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce first inversion and normal form E minor chords. Bounty Killer then toasts the bridge, and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.|$|E

25|$|Two {{things should}} be noted about the second {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly speaking only the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures of Scene 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance of the voices (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure</b> of Scene 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E

500|$|A half-measure {{complicates the}} metre of the verses, {{as well as}} the fact that the vocals begin in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure.</b> The first verse comes after the refrain, and is eight {{measures}} long. The verse (for example [...] "Always, no sometimes ...") starts with an F major chord in the key of B (or E chord in the key of A) (V), which progresses to G minor, the submediant, a deceptive cadence. According to Alan Pollack, the [...] "approach-avoidance tactic" [...] (i.e., the deceptive cadence) is encountered in the verse, as the leading-tone, A, appearing on the words [...] "Always know", [...] "I know when", [...] "I think I know of thee" [...] and [...] "I think I disagree", never resolves into a I chord (A in A key) directly as expected. Instead, {{at the end of the}} verse, the leading note, harmonised as part of the dominant chord, resolves to the prevailing tonic (B) at the end of the verse, after tonicizing the subdominant (IV) E chord, on [...] "disagree".|$|E

500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure</b> begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when I can still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside."
