5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus and 26 others {{taken in}} the 1800 {{invasion}} were subsequently restored to the King of Bavaria in 1815. Five of the paintings in William IV's original set of eight – including The Battle of Alexander at Issus – later passed from the royal collection to <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek</b> art museum in Munich, Germany, where they remain; the other three are in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm, having been looted by the Swedish army in the Thirty Years War of 1618–1648. Susannah and the Elders is the only other work by Altdorfer in <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek,</b> Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden was {{strongly}} influenced by Jan van Eyck, and the painting {{is very similar to}} the earlier Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, usually dated to around 1434, with significant differences. The figure's positioning and colourisation are reversed, and Luke takes centre stage; his face is accepted as van der Weyden's self-portrait. Three near contemporary versions are in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek,</b> Munich, and the Groeningemuseum, Bruges. The Boston panel is widely considered the original from underdrawings that are both heavily reworked and absent in other versions. It is in relatively poor condition, having suffered considerable damage, which remains despite extensive restoration and cleaning.|$|E

5|$|Wing {{panels and}} other {{fragments}} of Lochner's larger works are today spread across various museums and collections. Two surviving double-sided wing panels from an altarpiece {{with images of}} saints are in the London's National Gallery and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne (this now sawn through so both sides can be displayed on a wall). The wings of the Last Judgement originally had six parts, painted on both sides, but have been sawn into twelve individual pictures, now divided between the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek</b> in Munich and the Städel Museum in Frankfurt. It is probably from early in his career, but in subject matter and background differs from other extant and attributed works. While the elements are arranged in typical harmony, the composition and tone are unusually dark and dramatic. The Crucifixion is also an early work and reminiscent of late medieval painting. It has a heavily ornamented gilded background and the smooth flowing quality of the 'soft' Gothic style.|$|E
500|$|Duke William IV of Bavaria {{commissioned}} The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528 {{as part of}} a set {{of historical}} pieces that was to hang in his Munich residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of anachronism, was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In particular, the defeat of Suleiman the Magnificent at the Siege of Vienna may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of Daniel and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending apocalypse. The Battle of Alexander at Issus [...] and four others that were part of William's initial set are in <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek</b> art museum in Munich.|$|E
500|$|The late 18th century saw the {{nationalisation}} {{of royal}} or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek,</b> Munich) {{opened to the}} public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793. Great Britain, however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British Royal Collection remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this [...] "invaluable treasure" [...] and suggested that it be housed in [...] "a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum" [...] Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now {{to be found in the}} State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.|$|E

The National Gallery, London has three paintings with others in [...] the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, Apsley House, Windsor Castle, [...] Petworth House, the Wellcome Library and Liverpool. [...] In 2006 an exhibition at the Städel, Frankfurt, then Edinburgh, and the Dulwich Gallery in London reunited almost all his oeuvre.|$|E
2500|$|The British Royal Collection, {{which still}} {{contains}} {{many of his}} paintings {{of the royal family}} and others, has a total of twenty-six paintings. The National Gallery, London (fourteen works), The Museo del Prado (Spain) (twenty-five works), The Louvre in Paris (eighteen works), <b>The</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek</b> in Munich, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC and the Frick Collection have examples of his portrait style. [...] Wilton House still holds the works he did for one of his main patrons, the Earl of Pembroke, including his largest work, a huge family group portrait with ten main figures.|$|E
2500|$|Under the art loving Johann Wilhelm II (r. 1690–1716), a vast {{art gallery}} {{with a huge}} {{selection}} of paintings and sculptures, were housed in the Stadtschloss (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector Charles Theodore inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to Munich. With him he took the art collection, which became {{part of what is}} now <b>the</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek</b> in Munich. Destruction and poverty struck Düsseldorf after the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon made Berg a Grand Duchy and Düsseldorf its capital. Johann Devaranne, a leader of Solingen's resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. After Napoleon's defeat, the whole Rhineland including Berg was given to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Rhine Province's parliament was established in Düsseldorf. [...] By the mid-19th century, Düsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the Industrial Revolution as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892. In 1920, Düsseldorf became the centre of the General Strike. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the Freikorps.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek's</b> rather {{monolithic}} structure contains {{a treasure trove}} of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two sprawling floors. Major displays include Albrecht Dürer's Christ-like Self-Portrait, his The Four Apostles, Raphael's paintings The Canigiani Holy Family and Madonna Tempi as well as Peter Paul Rubens self-portrait Honeysuckle Bower and his two-storey-high Judgment Day. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The Madonna of the Carnation is the only painting of Leonardo da Vinci in a German gallery.|$|R
2500|$|Some of his {{original}} engravings {{are believed to have}} inspired Pieter Bruegel the Elder's compositions. [...] For instance, a print of Baltens on the theme of the Land of Cockaigne ('Luilekkerland' in Dutch) was likely the inspiration for Bruegel's treatment of <b>the</b> subject (<b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek,</b> Munich). [...] Some original engravings of Baltens were in the past attributed to Pieter Bruegel as Baltens used the monogram 'PB' on some of his prints.|$|R
50|$|Even {{while he}} was a {{frequent}} collaborator with Rubens’ workshop in the 1630s, Quellinus developed a personal style distinctive from that of Rubens. This style is reminiscent of the Antwerp followers of Caravaggio such as Theodoor Rombouts and Gerard Seghers. Characteristics of this style are the strong modeling of forms achieved through a sculptural use of light. Quellinus’ oldest known work is the 1634 Adoration of <b>the</b> Shepherds (<b>Alte</b> <b>Pinakothek,</b> Munich), which is in this Caravaggesque mode.|$|R

In 1949, it was renamed to Staatliche Graphische Sammlung and relocated to Münchner Haus der Kulturinstitute. In 2002, the Graphische Sammlung has own exhibition areas in the Pinakothek der Moderne for temporary exhibitions (Sonderausstellungen).|$|R
