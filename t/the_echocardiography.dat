40|$|Background Patent ductus arterious (PDA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart diseases encountered in preterm infants. The lower the birth weight and gestational age are, the higher the incidence of PDA is. Objectives To investigate the incidence of PDA in premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal wards of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital using echocardiography. Methods Preterm infants born between August and October 2003 were included in this study. Clinical features were retrieved from medical charts. <b>The</b> first <b>echocardiography</b> was conducted on all of the preterm infants at the chronological age of 3 days. If PDA was detected, echocardiography was repeated at the chronological age of 6 days. Results During the 3 -month period, sixty-five preterm infants participated in this study and underwent <b>echocardiography.</b> In <b>the</b> first echocardiogram, the incidence rate of PDA was 32 %. At gestational age of less than 28 weeks, 1 of 2 infants had PDA. Of 3 infants with birth weight of more than 1000 grams, 2 had PDA. On <b>the</b> second <b>echocardiography,</b> <b>the</b> incidence rate of PDA was 14 % and mostly found in infants at gestational age of less than 28 weeks (8 / 9) and in those with birth weight of less than 1000 grams (7 / 9).

5000|$|Patients {{are placed}} under a general anesthetic, and a {{catheter}} containing the MitraClip is {{inserted into the}} femoral vein. Fluoroscopy (X-ray imaging) helps the surgeon to guide the device through the venous system to the heart. Once at the heart, echocardiography (ultrasound imaging) is used to position the device at the mitral valve. The device enters the heart through the inferior vena cava to the right atrium. The surgeon will pass the catheter through the septal wall between the two atria, allowing the device to pass to the left atrium. This is a very precise puncture that requires both <b>the</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and fluoroscopy images to locate the proper area. The MitraClip passes through the annulus into the left ventricle and sits below the leaflets. Once on the ventricular side of the mitral valve, the MitraClip is opened and pulled towards the atria. The open MitraClip grabs both mitral valve leaflets, the surgeon closes the clip, and the leaflets are clipped together. Fastening the clip to the leaflets decreases regurgitant blood. [...] The use of both echocardiography and fluoroscopy is necessary to perform the implantation of MitraClip. However, this requires the surgeon to mentally fuse the images from these two separate methods. The use of new technology called the EchoNavigator software can merge the images from echocardiography and fluoroscopy. This software aims to reduce procedure time and increase success in MitraClip procedures. The integration of both imaging techniques is especially valuable during the puncture of the atrial septum and while grasping the leaflets and fastening the MitraClip. These are the two steps that are dependent on the surgeon having precise placement in the heart, and the EchoNavigator helps with this placement. In cases where multiple MitraClips are necessary to decrease the mitral regurgitation, the use of EchoNavigator can substantially reduce the procedure time.|$|E

50|$|Since its discovery, {{the use of}} CO {{monitoring}} {{has been}} restricted to certain kind of patients {{because of the risk}} of the classical procedures. Lately, new kinds of methods and devices have been developed. Nowadays, at practice, the method election is determined mainly by the features of the patients and the possibilities of the hospital to accede to this technology.Different CO monitor methods can be characterized by their invasiveness or their ability to measure continuously. The most ideal should be reliable, continuous, non-invasive, easy to use and cost-effective. The invasive methods like the still gold standard method Swan-ganz catheter (pulmonary artery catheter), based on transcardiac thermodilution, are being replaced by its invasiveness; hence these systems will not be inspected in this document.The minimally invasive methods also require catheterization, but less harmful. One of them is the Thermodilution Transpulmonary (TDTP), developed in the late 90’s, which presents risk of iatrogenic effect effects such as pneumothorax, Bleeding, infection, thrombosis or vascular ischemia, inherent to the requirement of both arterial and central venous catheter. As calibrating method, this system performs a thermodilution curve by measuring the changes in blood temperature due to the injection of cold serum and calculates the CO intermittently through a modified equation of Stewart-Hamilton. Furthermore, this method lets a continuous reading of the CO through the analysis of the arterial Pulse Pressure (PP) wave.Admittedly, these systems have some limitations, related for example to the thermodilution, such as thermic artefacts due to the injection of another serums or during the extracorporeal purification treatment (this therapy is required by approximately the 5% of patients in critical areas). Most of the monitors able to provide a continuous measure of the CO, are based on the analysis of the arterial blood pressure(BP) curve, called pulse contour methods. They are founded {{by the fact that the}} pulse pressure is proportional to the ejection volume; however, this is only true when aortic resistance remains constant, hence, these methods have some limitations such as obesity, which affects the arterial distensibility, or aortic regurgitation. Furthermore, the values may be modified in patients with Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP) or unstable arterial signal as in cases of severe arrhythmias or ventricular extrasystolia. The signal can be altered also by shock or hypothermia states because of the peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial spasm. Usually for calculating the stroke volume, the methods based on pulse wave analysis need previous and periodic calibrations that must be done in the same patient, which is a drawback.The main non-invasive methods can be classified in two groups. The first group is formed by different variations of <b>the</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and echo-Doppler techniques and the second group is comprised by the aortic bioimpedance and bioreactance.|$|E
