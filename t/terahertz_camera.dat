40|$|We report {{terahertz}} coded-aperture imaging using photo-induced reconfigurable aperture arrays on a silicon wafer. The coded aperture {{was implemented}} using programmable illumination from a commercially available {{digital light processing}} projector. At 590 GHz, each of the array element apertures can be optically turned on and off with a modulation depth of 20 dB and a modulation rate of ~ 1. 3 KHz. Prototype demonstrations of 4 by 4 coded-aperture imaging using Hadamard coding have been performed and this technique has been successfully applied to mapping THz beams by using a 6 by 6 aperture array at 590 GHz. The imaging results agree closely with theoretical calculations based on Gaussian beam transformation, demonstrating that this technique is promising for realizing real-time and low-cost <b>terahertz</b> <b>cameras</b> for many applications. The reported approach provides a simple but powerful means to visualize THz beams, which is highly desired in quasi-optical system alignment, quantum-cascade laser design and characterization, and THz antenna characterization.

40|$|Until recent years, {{terahertz}} (THz) waves were an undiscovered, or most importantly, an unexploited area {{of electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{was due to}} difficulties in generation and detection of THz waves. Recent advances in hardware technology have started {{to open up the}} field to new applications such as THz imaging. This non-destructive and non-contact imaging technique can penetrate through diverse materials such that internal structures, in some cases invisible to other imaging modalities, can be visualized. Today, there are variety of techniques available to generate and detect THz waves in both pulsed and continuous fashion in two different geometries; transition, and reflection modes. In this thesis continuous wave THz imaging was employed for higher spatial resolution. However, with any new technology comes its challenges; automated processing of THz images can be quite cumbersome. Low contrast and the presence of a widely unknown type of noise make the analysis of these images difficult. In this work, there is an attempt to detect defects in composite material via segmentation by using a Terahertz imaging system. According to our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this type of materials are being tested under <b>Terahertz</b> <b>cameras</b> to detect manufacturing defects in aerospace industry. In addition, segmentation accuracy of THz images have been investigated by using a phantom. Beyond the defect detection for composite materials, this can establish some general knowledge about Terahertz imaging, its capabilities and limitations. To be able to segment the THz images successfully, pre-processing techniques are inevitable. In this thesis, a variety of different image processing techniques, self-developed or available from literature, have been employed for image enhancement. These methods range from filtering to contrast adjustment to fusion of phase and amplitude images by using fuzzy set theory, to just name a few. The result of pre-procssing and segmentation methods demonstrates promising outcome for future work in this field...|$|R
40|$|Terahertz waves {{correspond}} to the frequency band of 0. 3 - 3 THz of the electromagnetic spectrum. This region of the spectrum has been considered as a gap since detecting and generating terahertz waves {{have always been a}} scientific and a technical challenge. The interesting properties of terahertz waves have been first applied in astronomy and spectroscopy. This has lead the scientific community to develop and invent new technical solutions for this frequency range. Because of the interesting properties of terahert zwaves, applications have emerged in various domains such as medical imaging, security, safety, quality control and communication. However, the available solutions are bulky and difficult to integrate for portable applications. Recently, different research groups have shown that standard silicon technology is a potential candidate to replace existing systems for terahertz generation and detection, enabling easy integration with on-chip readout and control electronics. This PhD dissertation focuses on the design and analyses of room temperature terahertz direct detectors in different silicon technologies, their integration in a large camera system with on-chip readout and control electronics. The thesis addresses also the integration of control circuits for silicon based terahertz source arrays as well as imaging demonstrations. The first step was to investigate single-pixel detectors in standard 65 nm CMOS bulk and 0. 25 µm BiCMOS SiGe technologies. The detectors were antenna coupled and integrated in 3 x 5 pixel arrays. They made use of the non-linearity of standard devices for detecting the captured power by the integrated antennas. Novel detectors were investigated and led to state-of-the-art performance in terms of operation frequency and sensitivity in comparison with other research on silicon devices. But, what arouses great interest in standard silicon implementations are the large scale integration possibilities. Therefore, as the second step of this thesis, a 1 k-pixel CMOS based <b>terahertz</b> <b>camera</b> was implemented in a collaborative teamwork during this thesis. It was considered as state-of-the-art device in terms of operation frequency and system integration. Other implementation concepts were investigated and analyzed in this thesis for scalable and adaptable readout circuits. The implemented detector systems were designed for active illuminations. In fact, their sensitivity can not detect passive radiation from the environment. Therefore, artificial sources were needed. As the third step of this research work, a terahertz control circuit was implemented in a 0. 13 µm BiCMOS SiGe technology for a 4 x 4 source array radiating at around 0. 53 THz. Control circuits for terahertz sources are a key feature to reduce power consumption and generate arbitrary patterns essential for terahertz active imaging. As a final part of the thesis, terahertz imaging were demonstrated to show the capability of the implemented detectors, camera and sources. Scanned objects were shown at terahertz frequencies. Real-time terahertz imaging were demonstrated with the 1 k-pixel CMOS camera module as well as the evaluation of a monitoring application for a laboratory terahertz source...|$|E
40|$|The Terahertz {{frequency}} range, {{often referred}} to as the `Terahertz' gap, lies wedged between microwave at the lower end and infrared at the higher end of the spectrum, occupying frequencies between 0. 3 - 3. 0 THz. For a long time, applications in THz frequencies had been limited to astronomy and chemical sciences, but with advancement in THz technology in recent years, it has shown great promise in a wide range of applications ranging from disease diagnostics, non-invasive early skin cancer detection, label-free DNA sequencing to security screening for concealed weapons and contraband detection, global environmental monitoring, nondestructive quality control and ultra-fast wireless communication. Up until recently, the terahertz frequency range has been mostly addressed by high mobility compound III-V processes, expensive nonlinear optics, or cryogenically cooled quantum cascade lasers. A low cost, room temperature alternative can enable the development of such a wide array of applications, not currently accessible due to cost and size limitations. In this thesis, we will discuss our approach towards development of integrated terahertz technology in silicon-based processes. In the spirit of academic research, we will address frequencies close to 0. 3 THz as `Terahertz'. In this thesis, we address both fronts of integrated THz systems in silicon: THz power generation, radiation and transmitter systems, and THz signal detection and receiver systems. THz power generation in silicon-based integrated circuit technology is challenging due to lower carrier mobility, lower cut-o frequencies compared to compound III-V processes, lower breakdown voltages and lossy passives. Radiation from silicon chip is also challenging due to lossy substrates and high dielectric constant of silicon. In this work, we propose novel ways of combining circuit and electromagnetic techniques in a holistic design approach, which can overcome limitations of conventional block-by-block or partitioned design methodology, in order to generate high-frequency signals above the classical definition of cut-off frequencies (ƒt/ƒmax). We demonstrate this design philosophy in an active electromagnetic structure, which we call Distributed Active Radiator. It is inspired by an Inverse Maxwellian approach, where instead of using classical circuit and electromagnetic blocks to generate and radiate THz frequencies, we formulate surface (metal) currents in silicon chip for a desired THz field prole and develop active means of controlling different harmonic currents to perform signal generation, frequency multiplication, radiation and lossless filtering, simultaneously in a compact footprint. By removing the articial boundaries between circuits, electromagnetics and antenna, we open ourselves to a broader design space. This enabled us to demonstrate the rst 1 mW Eective-isotropic-radiated-power(EIRP) THz (0. 29 THz) source in CMOS with total radiated power being three orders of magnitude more than previously demonstrated. We also proposed a near-field synchronization mechanism, which is a scalable method of realizing large arrays of synchronized autonomous radiating sources in silicon. We also demonstrate the first THz CMOS array with digitally controlled beam-scanning in 2 D space with radiated output EIRP of nearly 10 mW at 0. 28 THz. On the receiver side, we use a similar electronics and electromagnetics co-design approach to realize a 4 x 4 pixel integrated silicon <b>Terahertz</b> <b>camera</b> demonstrating to the best of our knowledge, the most sensitive silicon THz detector array without using post-processing, silicon lens or high-resistivity substrate options (NEP < 10 pW &# 8730; Hz at 0. 26 THz). We put the 16 pixel silicon THz camera together with the CMOS DAR THz power generation arrays and demonstrated, for the first time, an all silicon THz imaging system with a CMOS source. </p...|$|E
40|$|Terahertz is {{the portion}} of the {{spectrum}} that covers a frequency range between 300 GHz - 3 THz. This frequency band has proven its potential for imaging applications thanks to the good compromise between spatial resolution and penetration; however, this push towards high frequencies contains many technological difficulties in all the subsystems involved in the signal generation, transmission and detection. The power budget restrictions and high losses that sources and receivers currently suffer at these frequencies require systems {{with a high level of}} integration among all the devices and components of the systems and subsystems. Therefore, the antennas needed for these systems require to be integrated within the same fabrication processes and technologies as the sensing and power converting devices that are used at their terminals. This doctoral thesis has focused on the development of integrated antenna arrays at Terahertz frequencies for imaging applications, for both near-field and focal-plane geometries, with a special emphasis on the technologies and the fabrication capabilities that can be potentially used and are currently available. The current imaging systems require large arrays of antennas in order to achieve the high-speed image acquisition that is required in most THz applications. This fact increases considerably the difficulty and complexity to achieve highly integrated and efficient antennas. This thesis has characterized and analyzed these difficulties and provided solutions to the development of antenna arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies. The first part of this thesis has focused on the study of a planar antenna array, called retina, for a specific near-field imaging system based on the Modulated Scatterer Technique (MST) at millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequencies. This system has been selected for its capabilities to perform high-speed imaging and because it does not require a high frequency distribution line network. However, it is hindered by many technological difficulties: the selection of an antenna geometry that achieves high efficiency, the selection of the adequate active element and its integration with the antenna. In this thesis, these challenges have been addressed and studied in-depth, and a design methodology that integrates all the different aspects of the system has been developed. Because planar antennas at millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies suffer from high losses due to the surface wave modes inside substrate, these losses have been analyzed and quantified for different antennas, and an antenna geometry that reduces significantly this problem has been developed. Different switching technologies currently or potentially available at these high frequencies have been considered in order to study and analyze their capabilities and their integration possibilities: PIN diodes, Schottky diodes and RF-MEMS. These technologies have been studied through the development of three retina prototypes, which have been fabricated using high precision fabrication processes such as laser micromachining and photolithographic. Different measurement set ups were fabricated and assembled to validate the different premises presented. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of integrated Focal Plane Arrays (FPA). The development of FPA at submillimeter wave frequencies is highly on demand due to the enormous progress in designing integrated heterodyne receivers. These receivers integrate arrays of submillimeter-wave diode-based mixers and multipliers with Monolithically Integrated Circuit (MIC) amplifiers on the same wafer stack. For this stackable multi-pixel <b>terahertz</b> <b>camera</b> technology to work, a leaky wave antenna with silicon micro-lenses has been developed, which allows wafer level integration compatible with silicon micro-fabrication techniques for bulk array manufacturing and has high directivity in order to illuminate a reflector efficiently. Detailed and thorough design guidelines for this antenna are presented. Two antenna prototypes were built in order to evaluate the two fabrication possibilities: advanced laser micro-fabrication and photolithographic fabrication. A study of the aberrations of the lens has been developed in order to evaluate the performance of the lens profile fabricated. Moreover, a set of radiation pattern measurements of the fabricated prototypes was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the antenna and its possibilities to be used as a FPA.

40|$|A passive <b>terahertz</b> video <b>camera</b> {{allows for}} fast {{security}} screenings from distances of several meters. It avoids irradiation or the impressions of nakedness, which oftentimes cause embarrassment and trepidation of the concerned persons. This work describes the optimization of highly sensitive superconducting transition edge sensor bolometers (TES) {{for such a}} system. They enable frame rates of up to 25 Hz and {{have the capability to}} also detect non-metallic objects. Several challenges were addressed in this work:Based on a series of oxidation experiments, the sensor design could be optimized to achieve significant enhancements in long term parameter stability and reproducibility. Further measurements analyzing non-ideal behavior of the superconducting thermistor of the sensor were used to reduce excess noise and to minimize distorting influences on the low temperature readout electronics. This drastically improved the usability of the sensors for larger arrays. The chosen approach to optimize time constants while maintaining a high coupling efficiency was based on FEM models. They were used to simulate the optical coupling as well as time dependent thermal and electrical interactions, which allowed for more precise predictions of the sensor behavior compared to the common lumped model for TES. The simulation results were verified by several measurements on different designs. The applicability of these results was proven by the implementation of these sensors in a demonstrator system. Stable simultaneous operation of 64 sensors was shown and terahertz videos of 25 frames per second were achieved while attaining the same imaging quality as for lower frame rates...|$|R
40|$|Structured {{photonic}} {{materials are}} typically composed of periodic subwavelength elements where the unit cell geometries can impact the overall optical {{characteristics of the}} bulk material. By using micro and nanofabrication technologies {{it is possible to}} engineer the electromagnetic properties of structured photonic materials for a given application and create a variety of optical components such as band pass filters and absorbers. Two structured photonic materials that have gained substantial interest in recent years are plasmonic filters and metamaterials which are well suited for optical and terahertz imaging applications, respectively. In addition to imaging applications within individual wavebands, structured photonic materials, such as plasmonic filters and metamaterials, could be hybridised and combined with suitable sensors to create a multi-spectral imaging system capable of imaging at optical and terahertz wavebands simultaneously. These new hybrid structured photonic materials are known as synthetic multi-spectral materials, and their development will be presented in this work. To design synthetic multi-spectral materials it was necessary to optimise the plasmonic filter and metamaterial components independently. This involved electromagnetic simulation studies using finite-difference time-domain techniques, fabrication of the structured materials and characterisation using suitable techniques for the relevant spectral band. It was also necessary to ensure that all structures used the same materials and similar fabrication processing techniques as a means of simplifying hybridisation of the two structures. Plasmonic filters exhibit extraordinary optical transmission due to coupling of light with surface plasmons at a metal-dielectric interface. A 16 colour plasmonic filter set, consisting of triangular hole arrays etched into an aluminium film, was optimised for imaging applications in the visible and near infrared spectral range. Initial work on the integration of synthetic multi-spectral materials with CMOS image sensors was undertaken by developing fabrication processes to integrate plasmonic colour filters with two different CMOS chips. Preliminary results from the characterisation of the optical filters fabricated on to the chips have been presented. The resonant wavelengths of the plasmonic colour filters were then scaled up to infrared wavelengths where it was necessary to consider the role of spoof surface plasmons on the extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon. This led to the fabrication of 8 short wave infrared plasmonic filters. Metamaterial band pass filters consist of a single metal film etched with a periodic complementary electric ring resonator unit cell structure. Metamaterial absorbers consist of an electric ring resonator, separated by a metallic ground layer by a dielectric spacer. In the course of this work, two metamaterial filters and four metamaterial absorbers were designed. The metamaterial structures exhibit resonant characteristics at terahertz frequencies. Three synthetic multi-spectral materials, each consisting of hybrid plasmonic filter and terahertz metamaterial structures, have been simulated, fabricated and characterised. The first synthetic multi-spectral material combines 16 plasmonic filters with a terahertz metamaterial filter and is capable of filtering 15 optical wavelengths and a single near infrared wavelength, whilst simultaneously filtering a single terahertz frequency. The multi-spectral filter demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} engineer the optical passband characteristics of a thin metal film over several decades of wavelength using a single electron beam lithography step. The second synthetic multi-spectral material consists of 16 plasmonic filters hybridised with a terahertz metamaterial absorber and can filter 15 optical wavelengths and a single near infrared wavelength whilst simultaneously absorbing a single terahertz frequency. Plasmonic filters and metamaterial absorbers are promising components for use in the development of new optical and terahertz imaging systems, respectively, and therefore the second synthetic multi-spectral material represents a significant step forward in the development of a visible and <b>terahertz</b> multi-spectral <b>camera.</b> The third synthetic multi-spectral material combines 7 plasmonic filters with a low metal fill factor metamaterial absorber, to increase the measured transmission of the plasmonic filter components. The third synthetic multi-spectral material is capable of filtering three optical wavelengths, a single near infrared wavelength, a single short wave infrared wavelength and two mid infrared wavelengths, whilst simultaneously absorbing a single terahertz frequency. Such a synthetic multi-spectral material could aid in the development of a visible, infrared and <b>terahertz</b> multi-spectral <b>camera...</b>|$|R
