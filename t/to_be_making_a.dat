Sources {{close to the}} film's unit initially denied those reports. Samantha later tweeted that Akhil appeared for shooting his portions in the film. When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as {{he did not want}} any other artist to do it if his voice worsened. He completed those activities just before he died on 22 January 2014. Only an appearance in a song remained incomplete.|$|E
5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, he appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion {{on the day of}} his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E

25|$|Within {{twenty seconds}} of the announcement, every CBS {{affiliate}} except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E

25|$|However, ATU's {{greatest}} {{success to}} date, where it {{emerged as a}} serious opponent to the Gazette, was at the North West Regional Branch Conference, held on 2006-01-21. At that conference, almost all the candidates on the ATU slate were elected. North West England was the main power-base of MSF for Labour, {{but the vast majority}} of the ATU's recommended candidates were relatively young and unknown, with many being drawn from the former UNIFI finance union, and the older activists from the MSF days were almost all absent from the slate. Apart from indicating that ATU have had some success within the finance sector, it could suggest that ATU want to be seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> clean start, and to avoid being associated with the political machinations of the MSF era.|$|E
25|$|In 1623, Abbas {{decided to}} take back Mesopotamia, which had been lost by his {{grandfather}} Tahmasp through the Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555). Profiting from the confusion surrounding the accession of the new Ottoman sultan Murad IV, he pretended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to the Shi'ite shrines of Kerbala and Najaf, but used his army to seize Baghdad. However, Abbas was then distracted by a rebellion in Georgia in 1624 led by Giorgi Saakadze thus allowing an Ottoman force to besiege Baghdad, but the Shah came to its relief {{the next year and}} crushed the Turkish army decisively. In 1638, however, after Abbas' death, the Ottomans retook Baghdad and the Iranian–Ottoman border was finalised to be roughly the same as the current Iran - Turkey and Iran - Iraq borders.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, Halladay gave up nine earned runs in just 2 innings. The next day, Halladay {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list with a right shoulder injury. On May 8, it was announced that he would have surgery on his shoulder to have a bone spur removed. The surgery was also to address fraying of his labrum, and rotator cuff. Though he was initially supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin' Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.|$|E

In May 2011, {{it was announced}} that Rademacher had been fired from the series following a noticeable decline in Jasper's airtime on the series. Rademacher last aired in July 2011, before returning in August in what he stated <b>was</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first of many guest appearances on the series.|$|R
500|$|The Soviets {{attributed}} the invasion to the [...] "Brezhnev Doctrine" [...] which {{stated that the}} U.S.S.R. {{had the right to}} intervene whenever a country in the Eastern Bloc appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> shift towards capitalism. There is still some uncertainty, however, as to what provocation, if any, occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade.

500|$|Also {{during this}} period, Gilbert wrote his most {{successful}} comic play, Engaged (1877), which inspired Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. Engaged is {{a parody of}} romantic drama written in the [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the Savoy Operas, with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language possible, to every single woman in the play; the [...] "innocent" [...] Scottish rustics being revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> living through throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services, and, in general, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. Engaged continues to be performed today by both professional and amateur companies.|$|E
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{recording}} of the album, Cunningham said, [...] "At the time we did the first record—which I really like and think is good—you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, {{and we were just}} so happy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better". Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded [...] "really fast" [...] and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone. AllMusic's review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's [...] "surprisingly sophisticated drumming". It was also noted that [...] "there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit".|$|E

[...] According to George Halas, Turner was [...] "perhaps the smartest player" [...] he had in 40 years as the Bears' coach, a player who [...] "knew every assignment for every player on every player."

2500|$|Traditionally Calgary's {{roads were}} {{built on a}} grid system. [...] Originally, the streets and avenues were named, but after 1904, they were {{numbered}}. [...] Today, numbered Streets (running north-south) and Avenues (running east-west) dominate the city, although names appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> comeback. [...] The city is divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest, and all street names and addresses end with suffixes corresponding to the quadrant {{of the city in}} which they lie (NW, NE, SE or SW). The central point of the quadrant system is the Centre Street Bridge, with Centre Street and Centre Avenue forming the boundaries (although the points vary; most of the south end has Macleod Trail as a boundary, except near Chinook Centre where Macleod Trail bends westward; in the west end, the Bow River forms the boundary for the most part). Roads in predominantly suburban residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result (although some suburban streets are indeed numbered if they fall in place on the grid).|$|E
