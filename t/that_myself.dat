500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like <b>that,</b> <b>myself</b> included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
2500|$|With {{victory in}} the Safari Rally in 2002, McRae made the record books as the driver with most event wins in the World Rally Championship. His record has since been broken by Carlos Sainz, Sébastien Loeb and Marcus Grönholm. McRae's {{contract}} with Ford {{came to an end}} following the 2002 season, and after reportedly asking for wages of five million pounds a year, Ford decided against renewing the contract, reluctant to commit such a high amount of their budget to a driver's salary. The two parties split on amicable terms, with Ford's European director of motorsport Martin Whitaker stating [...] "On behalf of all of us at Ford Motor Company I would like to publicly thank Colin and Nicky for their efforts during the past four years with the Ford team. I wish them both well in the future." [...] McRae said of his time with Ford [...] "It's been a very successful four years, we've achieved a lot of very good results and I'm quite happy <b>that</b> <b>myself</b> and Ford have had a very successful partnership." ...|$|E

60|$|Certainly you do {{and must}} praise my number one too much. Number one (<b>that's</b> <b>myself)</b> thinks so. I do really; and the supererogatory virtue of {{kindness}} may be acknowledged out of the pale of the Romish Church.|$|R
60|$|No, I'm {{going to}} tell him <b>that</b> <b>myself.</b> [To the FOOTMAN.] Ask Captain Montgomerie to come here.|$|E
60|$|Gee! I felt {{just like}} <b>that</b> <b>myself.</b> All day {{the country had}} been tugging at me, and now it tugged worse than ever.|$|E
60|$|BANNAL. Yes, I know. Intellect without emotion. Thats right. I {{always say}} <b>that</b> <b>myself.</b> A giant brain, {{if you ask}} me; but no heart.|$|E

60|$|Joe got mad {{and used}} awful language. But that didn't help none. So I talked soft and kind to Charley. That's {{the way to}} handle feebs. If you get mad, they get worse. I know. I'm <b>that</b> way <b>myself.</b> <b>That's</b> why I was almost the death of Mrs. Bopp. She got mad.|$|R
60|$|MRS. G. No, I {{kept all}} <b>that</b> for <b>myself.</b> (Sitting down by his side.) I thought you wouldn't mind.|$|R
60|$|The whispering, {{and intense}} silence that followed, {{coupled with the}} gloom, made me feel guilty. I saw nothing, but {{tried so hard to}} do so <b>that</b> I persuaded <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> I did, and {{attempted}} to aim.|$|R

6000|$|Yes: {{except the}} Rutland one. I'll sign <b>that</b> <b>myself.</b> Let the others {{go through the}} regular channels. We take the 2:10 train for New York. Are you ready? ...|$|E

6000|$|He showed {{surprise}} and regret, but even greater decision. [...] "Then it needn't trouble you, dear--it's enough <b>that</b> I <b>myself</b> go straight." ...|$|R
