40|$|The paper {{explores the}} effect of {{protection}} lobbying by solving a firm's dynamic optimization problem where there is uncertainty about future demand, the success of lobbying and non-zero entry/exit costs. It is found that firms in declining industries tend to lobby to prevent shutting down factories during economic <b>turndowns.</b> In contrast, firms in growing industries tend to lobby to prevent other firms from entering the market. The degree of this effect depends on the ratio of exit costs to entry costs. It is shown that the higher the ratio, the stronger the effect. ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{white dress}} shirt (a {{marcella}} or pleated bib is traditional) with double (or [...] "french") cuffs and a <b>turndown</b> collar. While the <b>turndown</b> is most appropriately semi-formal, the attached wing collar has been popular with American men since the 1980s.

2500|$|Black tie {{offers more}} leeway. Shirts may be soft (not starched), {{which gives the}} options of unstarched {{marcella}} or a pleated front, {{as well as the}} white tie shirts, which may also be worn with black tie. [...] The collar is still sometimes a stiff high wing collar (common in America, though the attached variety is more popular there), or a <b>turndown</b> collar (more frequently seen in Britain). In past decades, particularly the 1970s, ruffled shirt fronts were made fashionable by Will Hunter, although they are now out of favour. Dress-studs are optional, and are onyx set in either silver or gold if used; otherwise the buttons are normally concealed under a placket. Cufflinks tend to be as simple and understated as possible, and harmonise with, if not match, the studs.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{renewable}} generation {{on the grid}} along with market deregulation {{has resulted in a}} significant increase in the cycling of coal and gas-fired power plant. This increase in cycling will result in increased wear-and-tear costs for units that were not traditionally designed for cycling. Asset owners can make operational changes to mitigate the wear-and-tear impact or alternatively retrofit existing units for improved flexibility. With retrofits, these plants can provide increased operational flexibility, or in other words cycle more, but this comes at an initial cost. On the other hand, increased flexibility in terms of faster starts, better <b>turndowns</b> and ramp rates also provides opportunity for the asset owners to recover their costs in the market. This paper evaluates the operational, as well as cost-benefit of retrofitting power plants for flexibility using a portfolio of generation resources in North America...|$|R

40|$|In many countries, loan {{guarantee}} programs are {{important elements of}} government policy with respect to {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). If {{loan guarantee}} schemes are to be effective, a majority of firms obtaining assistance through such a scheme ought {{not to be able to}} obtain financing from existing sources: a property known as incrementality or additionality. This paper describes a new approach to measuring incrementality. This work uses a two-stage process to estimate the incrementality of loans made under the terms of the Canada Small Business Financing (CSBF) program. First, a logistic regression-based model of loan outcomes (essentially a credit-scoring model) is estimated based on a large representative sample of SMEs. The resulting model was consistent with prior expectations and exhibited high levels of goodness-of-fit. The model was then employed to classify a sample of firms that had received loans under the terms of the loan guarantee scheme. Incremental loans ought to be classified as “turndowns” by the model; hence the proportion of loan guarantee recipients that the model classified as <b>turndowns</b> is a direct measure of incrementality. For the CSBF loan guarantee program incrementality was estimated (with 95 % confidence) as 74. 8 ± 9. 0 %.

2500|$|Shirts {{designed}} to be worn with black tie are called [...] "formal shirts," [...] or [...] "tuxedo shirts" [...] in American English and [...] "dress shirts" [...] in British English. [...] Traditionally, the shirt is white, has a bibbed front that is either marcella or pleated, a <b>turndown</b> collar, and double (or [...] "french") cuffs. [...] In the early-20th century, a piqué shirt with a detachable wing collar and single cuffs such as is worn with white tie was used, and in the 1960s and 1970s ruffled bibs were popular, but neither styles are often seen today. The wing collar originally disappeared in black tie after the 1920s when the appropriately semi-formal attached <b>turndown</b> collar shirt became preferred, {{but it has been}} popular with American men in a less substantial, attached form since the 1980s. However, many style authorities argue that the wing collar should remain the domain of white tie for aesthetic reasons. Etiquette maven Miss Manners is one of those who feel that while the bow tie’s uncovered band is fine in a white-on-white scheme, “gentlemen with their black ties exposed all around their necks look silly."Although some style authorities consider the wing collar to be an acceptable option for black tie shirts, they should not be worn with double cuffs or a pleated bib, and are better suited to the more formal single-breasted peak lapel jacket. They should feature a bib that is either marcella or starched and include stiff single cuffs (secured with cufflinks), made of the same fabric as the bib; this type of shirt is exactly the same as one worn with white tie attire. The collar in this case should be tall and stiff, which may be attached or detachable. When a full dress shirt is worn in this fashion, it should be accompanied by the white marcella waistcoat ordinarily associated with white tie. Wearing white tie accessories in this manner is {{considered by many to be}} an affectation. Debrett's do not endorse the wing collar as being compatible with the black tie dress code.|$|E
2500|$|White dinner jackets {{are often}} worn in warm climates. They are ivory in color rather than pure white, and have self-faced lapels (i.e., {{made of the}} same fabric as the jacket) rather than silk-faced lapels. They are {{generally}} worn with {{the same types of}} shirts and accessories as black dinner jackets, though the <b>turndown</b> collar and cummerbund preferred to the wing collar or waistcoat. Similarly, the shawl lapel is more common in white dinner jackets. In the United Kingdom, the 20th-century etiquette was that white dinner jackets are never worn, even on the hottest day of summer, but are reserved for wear abroad. Today, white dinner jackets are frequently seen at weddings, formal beach events, and high-school proms, in the United States and at some concerts (famously for instance the Last night of the proms) in the United Kingdom. [...] In tropical climates, such as in Imperial Burma, desert fawn was historically used as the less formal color. At one time, the (civilian) mess jacket was also an option in warmer climates.|$|E

40|$|US presidential {{approval}} of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding {{has been the}} subject of much research that largely has been inconclusive or contradictor as it relates to whether funds may have been distributed in a biased way through the use of presidential discretionary power. The purpose of this study was to explore if or to what degree US presidents acted in a potentially biased manner with the {{approval of}} FEMA approvals during election years in election battleground states. This study was an exploration of whether there was presidential political favoritism in approving FEMA funding from 1996 - 2012. The theoretical constructs for this study were group justification bias and social identity theory. Study data were obtained through freedom of information requests from FEMA for access to every gubernatorial request for FEMA aid from 1995 - 2012 resulting in 1137 records. Data were analyzed using chi-square as tests of association. By measuring the presidential discretionary choice of approvals or <b>turndowns</b> with other variables highlighted what, if any, associations existed. This enables a reasonable person to form their own perception on whether bias was present, or not, based on the results. A key finding illuminated an association between presidential party affiliation and public assistance (p =. 005), 1 type of FEMA aid. The study did not, however, indicate any statistical association between the award of FEMA hazard mitigation funding and presidential bias. The positive social change implication stemming from this study includes information to policy makers regarding how FEMA aid is granted, which could assist in an evaluation of the FEMA aid process and approval in the future...|$|R
