5000|$|The M1890M1 mortar {{was most}} often {{installed}} on an M1896 carriage (as shown {{here in the}} images at top left and right). The mortar and its carriage weighed a total of 78.5 tons. The carriage was geared to enable it to be turned (in azimuth) {{by means of a}} traversing crank with two handles, located {{on the right side of}} the piece. A ring marked in degrees of azimuth ran around the mortar, just outside the inner steel circle or [...] "racer" [...] that carried the carriage, and a soldier read a pointer on the racer to aim the mortar in direction. The tube was raised or lowered (in elevation) by <b>twin</b> <b>geared</b> <b>wheels</b> with long spokes (resembling ship's wheels) that were located on either side of the carriage. The breech could be rapidly depressed to an almost level position for loading and then be quickly elevated for firing. Other carriages included the M1891 and M1908.|$|R

A gear element (3, 4) of the planetary <b>wheel</b> <b>gear</b> is connected to the eccentric body which supports at least one coupling element (6) for driving the press ram. The eccentric disc is connected to the planetary wheel support (4) or an annular wheel (3) of the planetary <b>wheel</b> <b>gear</b> which has an extra drive (11, 12) for varying the speed of the press ram.
