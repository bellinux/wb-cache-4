2500|$|U2 {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of their 1983 War album and War Tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The success of the 1983 Under a Blood Red Sky live album and the [...] video, however, had given them artistic—and for the first time—financial room to move. Following a show at Dublin's Phoenix Park Racecourse in August 1983, one of the final dates of the War Tour, lead vocalist Bono spoke in metaphors about the band breaking up and reforming with a different direction. In the 10th issue of U2 magazine, issued in February 1984, Bono hinted at radical changes on the next album saying that he couldn't [...] "sleep at night with <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all" [...] and that they were [...] "undertaking a real departure". As bassist Adam Clayton recalls, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee {{credited}} {{divine intervention}} for his rising poll numbers. [...] "There's only {{one explanation for}} it," [...] Huckabee said, [...] "and it's not a human one. It's the same power that helped {{a little boy with}} two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of 5,000 people." [...] When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas ads and videos — allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting — Huckabee chose one acknowledging that viewers were tired of political messages in the holiday season and that what [...] "really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ," [...] avoiding other candidates' [...] "Happy holidays" [...] formulation. The ad generated considerable media discussion about whether a white bookshelf in the background was a subliminal Christian cross; [...] Huckabee mocked the suggestion and said it was just a bookshelf. [...] When asked about the ad and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being a cross, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul stated that he had not seen the ad, but replied with the assumption that it was a cross, quoting Sinclair Lewis' warning that [...] "when fascism comes to this country, it will be wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. Is {{there such a thing as}} an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.

60|$|In {{this state}} of life however I {{remained}} some time, uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead.
