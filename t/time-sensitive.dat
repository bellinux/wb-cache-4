5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with <b>time-sensitive</b> elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol conducts {{humanitarian}} service missions, {{usually in}} support of the Red Cross. CAP aircrews transport <b>time-sensitive</b> medical materials, including blood and human tissue, when other means of transportation (such as ambulances) are not practical or possible. Following the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City when all general aviation was grounded, one of the first planes to fly over the World Trade Center site was a CAP aircraft taking photographs.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable and somewhat <b>time-sensitive</b> cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy {{enough to make}} the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.|$|E
5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with <b>time-sensitive</b> illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so {{that they will be able}} to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in <b>time-sensitive</b> applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on <b>time-sensitive</b> reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1925, Warfield {{constructed}} the Gross-Callahan Cutoff, which allowed <b>time-sensitive</b> trains to bypass chaotic Jacksonville, {{and built the}} Valrico Cutoff, which provided a direct route from Tampa to West Palm Beach. Warfield also leased the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, which ran from central Florida to Boca Grande, {{as well as the}} East and West Coast Railway between Arcadia and Manatee County.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{regarding}} viral diagnoses {{and treatments}} change frequently and limit quality care. Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low. Provider knowledge of antiviral therapies can improve patient care, especially in geriatric medicine. Furthermore, in {{local health departments}} (LHDs) with access to antivirals, guidelines may be unclear, causing delays in treatment. With <b>time-sensitive</b> therapies, delays could lead to lack of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Likened to a Bayesian network, an HTM {{comprises}} {{a collection}} of nodes that are arranged in a tree-shaped hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy discovers an array of causes in the input patterns and temporal sequences it receives. A Bayesian belief revision algorithm is used to propagate feed-forward and feedback beliefs from child to parent nodes and vice versa. However, the analogy to Bayesian networks is limited, because HTMs can be self-trained (such that each node has an unambiguous family relationship), cope with <b>time-sensitive</b> data, and grant mechanisms for covert attention.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{department}} (ED) waiting {{times have}} a serious impact on patient mortality, morbidity with readmission in less than 30 days, length of stay, and patient satisfaction. A {{review of the literature}} bears out the logical premise that since the outcome of treatment for all diseases and injuries is <b>time-sensitive,</b> the sooner treatment is rendered, the better the outcome. Various studies reported significant associations between waiting times and higher mortality and morbidity among those who survived. It is clear from the literature that untimely hospital deaths and morbidity can be reduced by reductions in ED waiting times.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{information}} {{collected by the}} MIDAS satellites was extraordinarily <b>time-sensitive,</b> the designers of the system could not use the film-canister dropping system that had been pioneered by the Discoverer/Corona/Samos series of reconnaissance satellites. In that system, the cameras aboard the satellites used photographic film capsules that physically re-entered the atmosphere before being retrieved mid-air by a military airplane. The MIDAS satellites would instead have to transmit their warning signals earthward via radio waves. Actual infrared images would not be transmitted due to the limited RF channel capacity that was available then. Instead, the satellite would simply send radio messages that it had detected a suspected missile launch {{as well as the}} time and location of the launch.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as softening agents that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to pure iron is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as hydrogen embrittlement. Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are <b>time-sensitive.</b> One alloying element intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, the 60th-year {{anniversary of}} the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works {{revealed}} they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, {{referred to as the}} UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the Air Force several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. The Air Force has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. Having the option of an onboard pilot is considered a deterrent because it can be used in peacetime situations where unmanned aircraft would more likely be engaged, since there is no possibility of killing a person. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled. Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for <b>time-sensitive</b> targets.|$|E
25|$|During the Geonic period (650–1250 CE), the Babylonian {{schools were}} the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim, {{the heads of}} these schools, were {{recognized}} as the highest authorities in Jewish law. Despite difficulties that hampered the irregular communications of the period, Jews who lived even in most distant countries sent their inquiries concerning religion and law to these officials in Babylonia. It was common for Jews outside of Babylon to ask to be sent {{a section of the}} Talmud along with “its explanation” or to ask the scholars in Babylon to settle Jewish arguments for which they could not find any precedent. The length of responsa from this period can span from less than a sentence to a large book. Many of the responsa are still being studied today in the Cairo Genizah. In the yeshiva during this time period, students and scholars would discuss these halakhic questions during kallah and then the head of the yeshiva would announce his decision and the leaders in the yeshiva would sign it. Another type of responsa were those that were more <b>time-sensitive,</b> so the gaon usually responded to them right away and with many different sections in order to answer multiple questions that were posed. Later Geonim also referred to the responsa and commentaries of earlier Geonim when writing responsa. In the latter centuries of the geonic period, {{from the middle of the}} tenth to the middle of the eleventh, their supremacy suffered, as the study of the Talmud received care in other lands. The inhabitants of these regions gradually began to submit their questions to the heads of the schools of their own countries. Eventually they virtually ceased sending their questions to Babylonian Geonim, so that during this period responsa of eminent rabbis of other lands appeared side by side with geonic rulings.|$|E
500|$|Although {{aphasiology}} is {{the historical}} core of neurolinguistics, {{in recent years}} the field has broadened considerably, {{thanks in part to the}} emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as PET and fMRI) and <b>time-sensitive</b> electrophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks; electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the N400, a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension. [...] The N400 was the first language-relevant brain response to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.|$|E
500|$|The Capitol Limited {{was inaugurated}} on May 12, 1923, as an all-Pullman {{sleeping}} car train running from Pennsylvania Station in New York City to Chicago, via Washington, D.C. Once {{west of the}} Pennsy's Newark station in New Jersey, the train used the Lehigh Valley and Reading Railroad as far as Philadelphia, where it reached B's own rails to Chicago. It was designed to compete against the luxury trains of the rival Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad. [...] Although the B's longer route put it at a competitive disadvantage in New York for <b>time-sensitive</b> travelers, [...] the B offered such luxuries in the 1920s as onboard secretaries, barbers, manicures, and valets. The Capitol's [...] "Martha Washington"-series dining cars were particularly noted for their Chesapeake Bay cuisine, served in ornate cars with leaded glass windows, glass chandeliers, and colonial-style furnishings. The Capitol Limited derived much of its passenger traffic from businessmen and government officials traveling between Washington and the midwest.|$|E
500|$|One {{year after}} the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Peggy Carter, {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve, is stuck {{compiling}} data instead of working field cases. One night while alone in the office, the case line rings, informing Carter of the location of the mysterious Zodiac. She goes to the location, and is able to retrieve the serum single-handedly. The next day, her boss, Agent John Flynn, reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission. Carter explains that the mission was <b>time-sensitive,</b> but Flynn is unmoved, dismissing the indignant Carter as an [...] "old flame" [...] of Captain America's who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. The case line rings again, this time with Howard Stark on the other end, who tells Flynn to inform Carter that she will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credit scene, Dum Dum Dugan is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created bikinis.|$|E

For Sylvia Patterson of the NME, {{the song is}} an [...] "obscenely catchy Motown swinger", she added that it is [...] "the proper pop genius destined to be number one until Japan falls into the sea". Rolling Stone magazine's David Wild called it [...] "a retro, Supremes-lite confection that's as undeniable as it is unoriginal." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as a [...] "delicious re-creation of Motown-era bop packed with skipping-down-the-street good vibrations". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine said that it has [...] "a bouncy, Supremes-like retro vibe", and called its hook [...] "irresistible". Flick also praised the David Morales remix of the song, calling it [...] "a vibrant, <b>time-sensitive</b> disco ditty", while Howard Scripps from The Press of Atlantic City called it [...] "an obvious girl-group ditty", and added that it [...] "is another potential hit". Conversely, {{in a review of}} Spiceworld, Andy Gill of The Independent, called the album a [...] "perky but charmless parade of pop pastiches", and described [...] "Stop" [...] as a [...] "pseudo-Motown stomp".|$|E

2500|$|Amongst the {{graphical}} enhancements in The Settlers II {{are more}} on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, with four aesthetically distinct races. Gameplay improvements include a more strategic battle system, which allows players {{to send out}} scouts, and utilise a stationary offensive weapon in the catapult. Additionally, there is a story-driven single-player campaign, replacing the narratively-unconnected missions from the first game, which simply got harder as the player progressed, without any kind of connective plot. Initially, the team took {{the concept of a}} single-player storyline too far, designing maps which placed tight limits on what the player could and couldn't do, and featured <b>time-sensitive</b> scripted incidents.

2500|$|The US {{district}} court judge for the District of Columbia, Richard Leon, declared [...] on December 16, 2013 that the mass collection of metadata of Americans’ telephone records by the National Security Agency probably violates the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. “Given the limited record before me {{at this point in}} the litigation – most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics – I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting <b>time-sensitive</b> investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.” “Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that their privacy interests outweigh the government’s interest in collecting and analysing bulk telephony metadata and therefore the NSA’s bulk collection program is indeed an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment,” he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1960s to {{the early}} 1980s, WTTV was known in Central Indiana for its local programming, {{including}} children's shows Janie (previously titled Popeye and Janie) and Cowboy Bob's Corral (previously titled Chuckwagon Theatre, both starring Bob Glaze {{in the role of}} Cowboy Bob). Late night horror movies during this timeframe were presented by Sammy Terry, a ghoulish vampire character portrayed by Bob Carter. The station frequently ran local advertising including from Dave Mason Buick, featuring the catchphrase [...] "Old Dave needs the money"; Mason was often shown in the stands during coverage of the Marion County fair. In the late 1980s, the station produced a film noir-styled mystery show titled Hide & Sneak, which was related to a scratch-off game distributed at local supermarkets. Solving the mystery presented in one of the skits led to prizes. Each episode aired only once, however, because of its <b>time-sensitive</b> nature.|$|E
2500|$|The Canada Health Act of 1984 [...] "does not {{directly}} bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," [...] but provides financial disincentives for doing so. [...] "Although {{there are laws}} prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed," [...] {{according to a report}} in the New England Journal of Medicine. Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. [...] Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for <b>time-sensitive</b> surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the Canadian Supreme Court in its 2005 ruling in Chaoulli v. Quebec, waiting list delays [...] "increase the patient’s risk of mortality or the risk that his or her injuries will become irreparable."
