60|$|I had no {{intention}} of quoting any part of the controversy on finance, but, on reflection, it may serve a good purpose to give one or two extracts from the letter of Mr. Harris. In order that this may be done fairly, both as it respects the point at issue and the parties concerned, {{it will be necessary to}} make a brief preliminary explanation. M. Sauliner, the principal writer of the other side, had made it a charge against our system, that nearly all the public money was derived from the customs, which he assumed was a bad mode of obtaining revenue. Let this be as it might, my answer, was, that, as between France and America, there was no essential variance of system, the only difference lying in the fact that the one got all the revenue it could in this manner, and that the other got all it wanted. I added, a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> excepted, that all the usual means of raising revenue known to other nations were available, at need, to the government of the United-States. To this latter opinion Mr. Harris took exceptions, saying, in effect, that the administration of Mr. Adams, the father, had been broken down by resorting to excises, stamp-acts, and direct taxation; and that since his unfortunate experiment, no administration in America had dreamed, even in time of war, of resorting to a mode of obtaining revenue which was so offensive as to produce the revolution of 1776! Of course Mr. Harris was reminded, that the stamp-act, of which the colonists complained, was repealed many years before the epoch of 1776; that the revolution proceeded from a denial of the right in parliament to tax the colonies at all, and not from any particular imposition; and that excises and a stamp-act had all been resorted to, in the war of 1812, without overturning the administration of Mr. Madison, or weakening that of his successor. But of what avail was a statement of this kind, in opposition to the allegations of one who appeared before Europe in the character of an American diplomate? Mr. Harris enjoyed the double advantage of giving his testimony as one in the confidence of both the French and the American governments--an advantage that a quotation from the statute-books themselves could not overcome.|$|E

50|$|Before 1776, the American Colonies {{were subject}} to {{taxation}} by the United Kingdom, and also imposed local taxes. Property taxes were imposed in the Colonies as early as 1634.

50|$|The {{discussion}} of Pardo's proposals produced two options for increasing revenue.

An ad hoc senate committee advocated an export tax or, alternatively, a nationalization of the nitrate fields, which would stop competition between the two fertilizers and bring the nitrate profit directly into the government treasury.|$|E

50|$|The March 11, 2008, the Argentine Economy Minister Martin Lousteau, {{announced}} {{the enactment of}} Resolution 125 / In the month of March 2008 was passed Resolution 125/2008, establishing {{a new system of}} export duties on exports, holding its increase or decrease to international price developments. This caused a conflict with the large estate owners from the agricultural sector, who protested against the government's decision to change the tax system of exports. During the protest, the landowners and main producers declared a series of measures such as roadblocks for national disruption of basic food supply and of long distance transportation and agricultural exports, making partial lockouts (lock out) of roadblocks and other ports and direct action measures. President Cristina Fernandez suspended the resolution and sent Congress a bill on the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of grains and compensation for small and medium producers, so it was the legislature that ultimately resolved the situation. The project received preliminary approval in Congress, but the vote in the Senate was not successful, scoring the equalizer in the vote, and was {{the vice president of the}} Nation Julio Cleto Cobos (President of the Senate), who had negative tie by voting against the project.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{magazine}} Choice of January 1987 the Australian Consumers' Association advised {{consumers to}} Buy Australian {{by all means}} when the quality was equal and the price comparable to imported products. Nevertheless, it is notable given that Choice is well regarded as an impartial source of information for Australian consumers, the Australian Consumers' Association refused {{to make a commitment}} to favour an Australian product over a better product from overseas. This could be classified as a typical means of moral suasion, which can be seen as benevolent compulsion, or making others conform without enforcing rules directly. It is also termed simply suasion (in Japan it is known as window guidance), it has been used to persuade consumers and institutions to keep to official guidelines. The moral aspect stems from pressing on the targets of the suasion their moral responsibility to operate {{in a way that is}} consistent with furthering the national good. In the United States it is known as jawboning - it means exercising the persuasive power of talk rather than legislation. In countries experiencing economic decline, especially those with a high unemployment level and trade deficit, consumers are urged to buy products made in their own country to help create jobs, assist in defeating unemployment and to avoid import penetration. Sometimes it is a so-called war against unemployment where policy makers like to raise an appeal to patriotic behaviour, shifting the responsibility of employment and the level of high import penetration towards consumers. Ultimately a successful moral suasion campaign which reduces import penetration significantly can be seen as a tax on imports with the potential to increase unemployment in the import sector as a result of decreasing demand for imports. The lower supply of the Australian dollar may cause it to be of higher value in the foreign exchange markets, which obviously leads to a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports,</b> or consequently employment of Australians by Australian manufacturers producing goods for overseas markets will reduce. Furthermore, given that consumers are shifting their demand for consumer goods to domestic products, it still remains a dilemma whether the retailers and manufacturers of domestic products invest in Australian business operations. Or in other words, which authority controls that the profits remain in Australia? ...|$|E

In this last case, <b>Tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>Exports</b> is also taken into account. Conclusions lead to recommend changes to the usual estimation of sector tax burden, which is considered wrong or at least incomplete in its treatment.

3000|$|The {{government}} intervenes in {{the economy}} by taxing trade. Without loss of generality, {{we assume that the}} government introduces an ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> at rate τ. We confine our attention to taxes on exports of the primary good. Since the equilibrium depends on relative prices, the effect of any tax on imports can be replicated by a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> (Lerner symmetry result). Because we are interested in Argentina, which is a country with comparative advantages in the primary sector, we will not fully develop the case in which the pattern of trade reverses. If the economy reverses its pattern of trade, we assume that export taxes (on the manufactured good) are zero. The economic agents take the export tax, τ, as given. Unless the country is in autarky, domestic prices are given by p_a^d = p_a([...] 1 - τ) and p_m^d = p_m, where the nominal exchange rate is normalized to 1. We assume that the government reinjects the tax proceeds into the economy via lump-sum transfers to agents.|$|E
