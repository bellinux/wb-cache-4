5|$|An 1869 Roper {{machine is}} now in the Smithsonian Institution, and one from 1868 is in private hands after being offered at auction in 2012. An 1894 Roper {{velocipede}} was exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum's The Art of <b>the</b> <b>Motorcycle</b> show at their Las Vegas venue, and was shown in 2011 at the Deeley Museum collection in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> basic <b>motorcycle</b> {{swingarm}} is a quadrilateral, {{with one}} short side connected to <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle's</b> frame with bearings {{so that it}} can pivot. The other short side is the rear axle around which the rear wheel turns.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>motorcycles</b> {{used during}} chase scene in film The Great Escape were 1961 Triumph TR6 Trophy models {{disguised}} as German BMW R75 <b>motorcycles.</b> <b>The</b> {{star of the}} movie, Steve McQueen, did much of the riding for the film himself, although Bud Ekins performed the famous jump scene as McQueen's stunt double. Pin-striper and artist Von Dutch converted <b>the</b> <b>motorcycles</b> for <b>the</b> movie while working at Ekins' shop.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motorcycle</b> {{technology}} of the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} {{had three}} speeds with no neutral position; a mechanism held the clutch open when <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> was at idle in first gear. First gear was positioned {{in the middle}} of the shift pattern, with second gear below and third gear above.|$|E
5|$|This {{machine was}} on exhibit in the 1960s at Bellm's Cars of Yesterday in Sarasota, Florida. An 1894 Roper {{velocipede}} was lent from the R. J. Boudeman family collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's 2001 expansion, Guggenheim Las Vegas, where The Art of <b>the</b> <b>Motorcycle</b> exhibition {{was the only}} show there until the expansion closed in 2003. It was the fourth venue for <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> design show which had first opened at the Guggenheim New York in 1998, where the Michaux-Perreaux velocipede {{had been the first}} machine viewers saw upon entering the rotunda of the museum. Later, the Boudeman Roper velocipede was on view at the 2011 Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver. An 1894 Roper was offered for auction in January 2012, with a claimed high bid of $425,000.|$|E

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle.</b> He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle.</b> <b>The</b> <b>motorcycle</b> bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided he needed to see for himself what was {{happening}} at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a motorcycle escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks out from under <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height {{of the center of}} mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. <b>The</b> <b>motorcycle</b> did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E

5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a moped, he went round a corner too quickly and skidded. He put out his leg to stop <b>the</b> <b>motorcycle</b> from falling over, and smashed his knee. <b>The</b> <b>motorcycle</b> then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his lower right leg too severely, it had to be amputated above the knee after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia. Allman was riding at a high speed in his motorcycle at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision.

The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.|$|E

5|$|Although Kuala Lumpur is {{touted as}} one of the host cities for the Formula One World Championship, the open-wheel auto racing A1 Grand Prix and <b>the</b> <b>Motorcycle</b> Grand Prix, races are held at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang in the {{neighbouring}} state of Selangor. The Formula One event contributes significantly to tourist arrivals and tourism income to Kuala Lumpur. This was evident during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Despite cities around Asia suffering declining tourist arrivals, Kuala Lumpur tourist arrivals increased from 6,210,900 in 1997 to 10,221,600 in 2000, or 64.6% increase in tourist arrivals. In 2015, the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit was constructed to host the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix motor racing event.|$|E
