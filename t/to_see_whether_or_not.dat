5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of June 1422, John {{contacted}} his old Schieringer allies <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> there would be any support for him left at all if he organised a new campaign to Friesland. There was not.|$|E
25|$|In some of {{the early}} manuscripts in which the pericope adulterae does not appear after John 7:52 (such as P66 and P75 and Codex N), the final page of the Gospel of John has not survived, making it {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the passage had been transplanted {{to the end of the}} book.|$|E

25|$|In February 2005, the Israeli police began {{a formal}} {{criminal}} investigation of Metzger regarding allegations {{of fraud and}} bribery related to benefits he received from a Jerusalem hotel. Metzger was questioned twice, and denied any wrongdoing, but suspended himself from the Rabbinical High Court in June 2005, while waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Israeli Attorney General, Menachem Mazuz, decided to indict him. No charges were brought, and Metzger and his supporters dismissed all of the accusations against him {{as part of an}} ongoing smear campaign against him.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept {{of social and cultural}} exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
500|$|A {{woman was}} {{recorded}} in 1881 as having claimed to recall that people once gathered at the lake on the first Sunday of August, waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the water would boil up as {{an indication that the}} Lady and her oxen would make an appearance. Davidson notes that [...] "here again a supernatural woman is linked both with water and ploughing land." ...|$|E

It contained—not papers {{regarding}} the conspiracy—but my lady’s wigs, washes, and rouge-pots, and Victoire said men were monsters, as the captain went on with his perquisition. He tapped the back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> no it was hollow, and as he thrust his hands into the cupboard, my lady from her bed called out with a voice that did not sound like that of a very sick woman, “Is it your commission to insult ladies as well as to arrest gentlemen, captain?” ...|$|R

500|$|He {{acknowledged}} {{that he had been}} driving MacMillan around the evening of July5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so. [...] According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> she had been able to. [...] During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them. [...] He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed.|$|E
500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this is where I have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> there's a God." ...|$|E
500|$|The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are {{the first}} known {{documents}} in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the [...] "Judenevakuierung" [...] or [...] "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination. At {{one point in the}} speech, Himmler says: [...] "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of [...] "elimination" [...] (Ausschaltung) before going on to say [...] "extermination" [...] (Ausrottung). His hesitation in the middle of saying [...] "elimination" [...] can be considered as a quick mental check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience. The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his Total War speech on February 18, 1943, begins to say [...] "Ausrottung des Judentums" [...] ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying [...] "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly. His resulting phrasing is [...] "Ausrott... schaltung des Judentums", which can be likened to [...] "exterm... elimination" [...] in English.|$|E

[...] In 2017, after Trump took office, Kaine continued to criticized the new president's [...] "authoritarian tendencies," [...] citing his attacks on media, judges, and peaceful protesters. At an event at George Mason University, Kaine said that with Trump in office, Americans [...] "are in a 'living experiment' <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Constitution still works to check executive power." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{ceremony}} {{carried out}} in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At {{the beginning and end of}} each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th century. When the result is known, the town crier announces [...] "And no more!" [...] if the mayor has not gained weight or [...] "And some more!" [...] if he has. His actual weight is not declared.|$|E
2500|$|Beckjord became {{intrigued}} {{with the idea}} of Bigfoot after seeing an article in the newspaper about alleged sightings of the creature. On an expedition <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the story was true, he claimed he saw a Bigfoot cross the road in front of him from about 200 feet away. Though he later returned with his camera and was unable to find the creature, Beckjord was then convinced of its existence. He also purportedly saw Bigfoot standing 6 feet tall and walking in a [...] "loose, limbo-dance style", and, at another time, eating apricots in an orchard around Vacaville, CA. He frequented a camp with other researchers, an alleged [...] "window site" [...] in the Bear River Reservoir area of Eldorado National Forest where he asserted that [...] "evidence of Bigfoot is almost routinely seen." [...] While he insisted that the exact location not be revealed to the public, Beckjord did agree to take skeptic Robert Sheaffer on a five-day expedition there in 1999. It was only after Sheaffer left the site, having seen nothing unusual, that Beckjord reported manifestations of Bigfoot.|$|E

2500|$|Perp walks resumed, {{with many}} {{corporate}} executives {{charged in the}} scandals of the early 2000s, such as Andrew Fastow and John Rigas, subjected to them. In 2003, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph C. Wilson evoked the perp walk, and provided another term for it, when accusing a senior Bush Administration official of leaking {{the name of his}} wife, Valerie a spy, to the media as retaliation for a New York Times op-ed in which he had cast doubt on key aspects of the administration's claims in support of the Iraq War: [...] "It's of keen interest to me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> we can get Karl Rove [...] out of the White House in handcuffs." [...] Liberal critics of the administration created images of that occurring; in 2008 a Code Pink protester in San Francisco attempted to make a citizen's arrest of Rove, who had by then left the government.

5000|$|Secondly, Cudworth {{argued that}} women {{should have access to}} {{education}} for not only their children’s spiritual welfare, but for their own as well. She argued that “Women have Souls to be sav’d as well as Men,” and that by being blessed with rational thinking, it was imperative that women understood the principles and values behind their own religious beliefs. [...] “They women are, perhaps sometimes told in regard of what Religion exacts, They must Believe and Do such and such things, because the Word of God requires it; but they are not put upon searching the Scriptures themselves, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether,</b> <b>or</b> no, these things are so." [...] She argued that a woman's duty and knowledge should not be grounded on the [...] "uncertain and variable Opinions of Men" [...] and should instead be able to nurture their minds as well as their bodies to form their own opinions about spirituality.|$|R
60|$|His {{next step}} was to search the {{neighbourhood}} for tracks, in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the wreck had been lately visited by human beings. This search resulted in discoveries which perplexed him greatly, for not only did he find numerous footprints which crossed each other in various directions, but he knew from their appearance that these had been recently made, and that they were those of white men as well as red; some of them showing the prints of shoes, while others displayed the marks of moccasins.|$|E
60|$|The next day, about noon, we {{all went}} to see the real {{governor}} of the colony. Rectus and I didn't care much about doing this, but Corny insisted on it.

We took Priscilla along with us on Corny's account. It would look respectable for her to have an attendant. This being an extra job, Priscilla earned two sixpences that day.|$|E
60|$|We {{will now}} {{consider}} {{a little more}} in detail the laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> these laws indicate that species have been specially endowed with this quality, {{in order to prevent}} their crossing and blending together in utter confusion. The following conclusions are drawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on the hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far they apply to animals, and, considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.|$|E

The sciences see the Digital Humanities as a welcome improvement over the non-quantitative and repetitive historically popular methods of the humanities and social sciences.|$|R
