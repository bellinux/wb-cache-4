25|$|Overall, {{on a first}} date, women’s {{goals are}} related more to {{establishing}} friendships and having fun.

(Note, however, {{that there are some}} errors in the mathematical calculations done in the study, and the study is statistically invalid as it uses the convenience sampling method.) Women's goals tend to be more relationship-oriented than men’s goals. Also, unlike men, women are usually more reserved {{when it comes to the}} sexual aspect and having sex.
