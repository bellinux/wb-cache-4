5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E

5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

40|$|The United States post-war {{period has}} seen a large {{increase}} in aggregate market hours worked, a decline in hours spent in home production, and a simultaneous increase in the <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> output ratio. This paper uses a model of sectoral reallocation to structurally relate these three phenomena and provide a novel explanation for {{the increase in the}} <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> output ratio. An increase in total factor productivity in the market sector relative to the home sector induces households to substitute measured market goods for unmeasured home goods when they leave the home to work in the more productive market sector. As long as the measured <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> output ratio is less than one, the flow <b>to</b> market <b>consumption</b> and production raises the measured <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> output ratio. This channel accounts for thirty percent of the increase in the measured <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> output ratio observed in the data from 1950 to 2007. JEL Nos. J 21, J 22, O 41, E 2 1...|$|R
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail tariff {{structure}} {{applies to the}} entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block {{tariff structure}}, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E

In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{criticism}} {{emerged in}} the early 2000s regarding the production orientation of the CAP {{and the need for}} decoupling due to the disjointed nature of agricultural production policy in relation <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> (and thus nutrition). The arguments were re-enforced at the 2001 European Health Forum Gastein on the CAP, which made explicit – to policy makers – the link between nutrient quality of diets and agricultural policy. The Forum also identified opportunities to align the CAP to health objectives, more specifically by encouraging changes to dietary behaviour through adjusting CAP support.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most vipers, {{members of}} this genus will strike and then hold on and chew. In one case, a machete was used to pry off the jaws. March (1929) wrote that A. mexicanus (A. nummifer) will hang on and make half a dozen {{punctures}} unless quickly and forcibly removed. However, {{the effects of the}} venom include only transient pain and mild swelling. In one part of Honduras the locals even insist that the snake (A. nummifer) is not venomous. Laboratory studies suggest that Atropoides venoms are unlikely to lead <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> coagulopathy and incoagulable blood in humans. However, other research revealed that of ten different Costa Rican pit viper venoms tested on mice, that of A. picadoi was the most hemorrhagic.|$|E
25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their secondary host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they sense when they bump into each other too often. The heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E

25|$|Cass made {{important}} contributions to pure economic theory, {{mostly in the}} field of general equilibrium theory. He made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth, the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets. He is perhaps best known for his article “Optimum Growth in an Aggregative Model of Capital Accumulation”, which was a part of his dissertation. In this paper he proves a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by Frank Ramsey. A major difference to the standard Ramsey growth model was that Cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted, thus implicitly assuming that consumers prefer consumption today <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> tomorrow. This modified version of the Ramsey growth model is also known as the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, named after Frank Ramsey, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans.|$|E
25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>consumption</b> taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Water quality. In 2015 WASREB {{reported}} that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined {{as more than}} 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with bacteriological standards (60% weight). If the number of samples taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in Kericho and Kisumu with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the taste and smell of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, {{the vast majority of}} respondents treat water prior <b>to</b> <b>consumption,</b> which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.|$|E

30|$|This {{scheme of}} {{controlling}} production according <b>to</b> expected <b>consumption</b> is questioned by {{increasing amounts of}} electricity produced by wind and solar farms according to weather conditions and not according to desired schedules. Thus, demand response (DR) approaches were developed to adapt the course of <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> that of availability. One option is providing customers with time dependent prices for the day ahead. This gives customers an incentive to shift their power <b>consumption</b> <b>to</b> times with lower prices corresponding to times of higher power availability (Vardakas et al. 2015). The approach protects the customer’s privacy by design as no central entity has knowledge about the customer’s flexibility in power consumption.
