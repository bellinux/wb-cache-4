5|$|In the 2010s, {{the novelty}} of the Pendolino has worn off and VR has even used the train in {{regional}} traffic between Oulu and Rovaniemi due to rail works in summer 2011. <b>The</b> <b>problematic</b> tilting mechanism was not used during winter 2010–2011 and the time benefit of the tilting was not {{taken into account in}} timetables of winter 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|This issue, {{which became}} a serious {{bottleneck}} when traffic on the new expressway greatly exceeded expectations, was remedied beginning in 2001 {{with the construction of}} two flyovers to replace <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> movements and the removal of the under-utilized connection from eastbound Mohawk Road to westbound Highway403. The $16 million project was completed in late 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that she needed to be towed. Despite <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E

5|$|Several {{scenes in}} the episode were filmed at a Canadian Airlines {{operations}} center in Richmond, British Columbia.

5|$|The {{article was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to give their suggestions on how to improve Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> situation for unmarried middle class women. Without a spouse a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic American nations from Mexico to Argentina {{suffered}} from coups d'état, revolts, dictatorships, political upheavals, economic instability, civil wars and secessions. Brazil, {{on the other}} hand, {{came out of the}} conflict with its system of constitutional monarchy strengthened and the cessation of internal revolts. <b>The</b> <b>problematic</b> province of Rio Grande do Sul had actively participated in the war effort. As a consequence, there was increased identification with Brazil among its populace, quelling of separatist feeling, and an easier and effective integration {{with the rest of the}} nation. Internal stability also allowed Brazil to begin assuming a respected place on the international scene, coinciding with the parallel emergence of the United States which was only now establishing its own borders. The European powers perceived in the Empire of Brazil a rare exception in a continent afflicted by civil wars and dictatorships. Brazil entered into a period of great economic, scientific and cultural prosperity, lasting from 1850 until the end of its monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Nigel and Vanessa Lawson {{divorced}} in 1980, when Nigella was 20. They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, some of the things Nigella found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to lose weight for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. Nigella has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> relationship she had with her mother.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. <b>The</b> <b>problematic</b> couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another private bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> northern section.|$|E
5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, {{in part due to}} the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The McElmo Phase was {{a period}} in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when major changes in {{ceramics}} and masonry techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon. Chacoans started using painted black-on-white pottery, and the masonry and layout of great houses built during the period, which was the last major construction era in the canyon, differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase (850 to 1140). Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from Mesa Verde, but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin. McElmo black-on-white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl, and <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> McElmo style masonry was used in several later additions to the building, including very characteristic Chaco-style kivas.|$|E

5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 2003, Benfica {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Brazilian midfielder Geovanni, on a loan deal from Barcelona {{until the end of}} the season. On 11 January, the team played Vitória Guimarães away. The 1–1 draw after 90 minutes was a consequence of the constant interruptions for a large number of fouls signalled by the referee. In the stands, <b>the</b> <b>problematic</b> behaviour of the Benfica supporters group No Name Boys caused the governing body of the Portuguese league to punish both clubs by closing their stadiums for one game each. On the following Sunday, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros for a game against Marítimo, which Benfica won 2–1 after an individual effort from Nuno Gomes in the 74th minute. It was the first win there since 1994–95. After selecting the Estádio Municipal Dr. Alves Vieira in Torres Novas to replace Estádio da Luz, Benfica hosted Beira-Mar on 26 January, winning 1–0 with a goal from Geovanni. Three days later, the team played the second friendly of the month after a 1–1 draw against Ajax a week before. During the game, intended to bring people to Da Luz, Benfica lost 0–1 to Barcelona.|$|E
