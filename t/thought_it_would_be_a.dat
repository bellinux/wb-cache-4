5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E

25|$|The name of {{the band}} was {{originally}} inspired by a racehorse called Archduke Ferdinand. After seeing the horse win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, the band began to discuss Archduke Franz Ferdinand and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good band name because of the alliteration of the name {{and the implications of}} the Archduke's death (his assassination was a significant factor in the lead-up to World War I).|$|E

25|$|For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or {{touching}} {{stories he}} gets through his email.

After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good idea to normalize unusual medical stories through humor.|$|E

By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably the Washington Post, <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> foregone conclusion that Gilmore would jump into the Senate race. Gilmore's successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner's announcement.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Go Seigen won {{a special}} Nihon Ki-in tournament {{to have the}} {{opportunity}} to play a game against Honinbo Shusai Meijin. At that juncture, Honinbo Shusai embodied the highest go authority and tradition in Japan. In addition to inheriting the hereditary title of Honinbo, he was also the holder of the prestigious position of Meijin. The game between Go Seigen and Shusai was thus highly anticipated. The newspapers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good business idea to publicize the game as a confrontation between Japan and China. As a consequence, Go Seigen became the unfortunate victim of rising Japanese nationalism. Before and during the game, he was often harassed and threatened by nationalists, and the windows of his house were smashed in.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 de Gaulle wrote Vers l'Armée de Métier (Toward a Professional Army). He {{proposed}} mechanization of the infantry, {{with stress}} on an élite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. Ironically the German panzer units, so effectively {{employed in the}} invasion of France in 1940, used similar theories, while the French dispersed and wasted their armour. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle’s mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the Treaty of Versailles, which forbade Germany from rearming. He also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that “a master has to make his appearance … whose orders cannot be challenged – a man upheld by public opinion”.|$|E

Guitarist Rory Clewlow described the cover art: [...] "Our society is often depicted as a pyramid, with the few at the top with all the wealth and the masses at the bottom with no wealth, but supporting the pyramid for the few at the top.

The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly {{halfway around the world}} to do this?' But it was terrific, because we worked really hard. We did a track a day.
