500|$|As {{the banking}} career {{was not working}} out – and as {{trainees}} were (after a period with a relaxed regime) again required to sit an exam, for which Bellman was ill equipped – he took a break in 1758, going {{to the university of}} Uppsala, where Linnaeus was professor of botany. The idea of attending lectures was no more congenial than banking, and he stayed only one term; one of his songs (FS 28) records that [...] "He contemplated Uppsala—the beer stung his mouth—love distracted his wits..." [...] However, he met young men (such as Carl Bonde) from wealthy and noble families, went drinking with them, and started to entertain them with his songs. Bellman returned to the bank job, and seems quickly to have fallen into financial difficulty: [...] "a jungle of debts, sureties and bondsmen began to proliferate around him." [...] The character of bailiff Blomberg appears in his songs (e.g. FS 14), constantly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> <b>down</b> debtors and seize all their property. The law allowed the bankrupt only one way to escape from debtors' prison: to leave Sweden. In 1763, Bellman ran away to Norway. From the safety of Halden (then called Fredrikshald) he writes to the Council applying first for a passport, and then for a safe-conduct, both of which were granted. Meanwhile, his father had first mortgaged the Lilla Daurerska house, and then sold it: the family's finances were no better than his own. Even worse, by April 1764 the Bank had become tired of the riotous behaviour of its young men: its investigations showed that Bellman had been the ringleader, leading them (the Bank wrote) into [...] "gambling, masquerades, picnics and suchlike". Bellman resigned, his safe banking career at an end.|$|E

2500|$|Former General Hospital head-writer, Ron Carlivati {{noted that}} [...] "Jason and Sam are an {{incredibly}} popular couple [...] a great couple {{who are very}} strong and very solid {{in a lot of}} ways. Former General Hospital head-writer Garin Wolf described Jason and Sam as an [...] "unconventional yet strong and unique couple." [...] Jason and Sam's similar love for danger and adrenaline have led them to be described as having a Bonnie and Clyde type of relationship. Several of their storylines have revolved around adventure with an [...] "us against the world" [...] theme present. The theme has been in place since the couple’s first meeting in the Port Charles Police Department, where they were both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos. They have been on the run from law enforcement more than once; most notably in early 2005 when Sam was framed for kidnapping and Jason {{was the only one who}} believed her innocence, in the summer of 2005 when they went on the run with Sonny's oldest son Michael Corinthos (then Dylan Cash) to protect him from murder charges and again the fall of 2006 when Sam was being framed for murder. The couple was referred to as a real live [...] "Bonnie and Clyde" [...] onscreen on July 31, 2009, when they were arrested while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> <b>down</b> runaways Michael and Kristina. The theme is further reinforced by the fact that the couple always turn to each other when dealing with high pressure situations, even during times of discord between them. They also have a similar comfort with living outside of the law and making their own rules. Former General Hospital head-writer Robert Guza, Jr. describes Sam as [...] "the last and only woman able to go toe to toe with Jason in action mode." ...|$|E

The team finally captures Anson {{with the help of}} Michael's brother Nate, but shortly after the CIA arrives, a gunshot from an unseen location kills both Anson and Nate. Fiona is released from prison and helps Michael in his search for the man who killed his brother. They eventually learn that the killer's name is Tyler Gray, and Card sanctions an off-the-books operation in Panama to take him down. However, when Michael finally captures him, Gray reveals that the operation is a sham: Card hired Gray to kill Anson and is planning a move that will kill Michael and his team. They escape, and Michael eventually confronts and kills Card, making every member of his team, as well as Maddie, targets in a CIA manhunt headed by Olivia Riley (Sonja Sohn).

But I glanced at his back and at his hands, and reassured myself. That broad, short man was not the slim figure of my Picture and of the photograph.
