In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal <b>thermal</b> <b>generation.</b> This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E

25|$|Mexico's {{installed}} electricity {{capacity in}} 2008 was 58 GW. Of the installed capacity, 75% is thermal, 19% hydro, 2% nuclear and 3% renewable other than hydro. The general trend in <b>thermal</b> <b>generation</b> is {{a decline in}} petroleum-based fuels and a growth in natural gas and coal. Since Mexico is a net importer of natural gas, higher levels of natural gas consumption (i.e. for power generation) will likely depend upon higher imports from either the United States or via liquefied natural gas (LNG).|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of <b>thermal</b> <b>generation</b> projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of heavy fuel oil and medium speed diesels.|$|E

In order to solve the problems, all options for power generation by new and renewable energies are enjoying growing attention in recent years. China has abundant solar energy resources and large wasteland areas, which makes China an ideal country for solar <b>thermal</b> power <b>generation</b> development. However, its present higher costs for China made it difficult to promote large-scale. Under this condition solar hybrid with coal <b>thermal</b> power <b>generation</b> becomes the best solution of the problem.

25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and <b>thermal</b> <b>generation</b> (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|However, {{electricity}} generation is not evenly {{divided between the}} two dominating sources. In 2006, 72% of Peru’s total {{electricity generation}} came from hydroelectric plants (total generation was 27.4 TWh), with conventional thermal plants only in operation during peak load periods or when hydroelectric output is curtailed by weather events. This “underuse” of the country’s thermal capacity {{is due to the}} high variable costs of <b>thermal</b> <b>generation.</b> In 2004, the country’s reserve margin was estimated at 45%.

Microfiche. ix, 164 leaves, bound 29 cmThis study basically {{attempts to}} determine the technological characteristics which are responsible for productivity changes in <b>thermal</b> power <b>generation</b> in Japan over the period of 1964 - 1988. Specific objectives are to estimate the magnitude of scale economies, technological change, capacity factor effect, elasticity of substitution between input factors and movements of total factor productivity in <b>thermal</b> power <b>generation</b> in Japan and derive policy implications regarding thermal power in the future generation mix. To achieve the objectives, a translog cost function incorporating variable representing technological change and capacity factor, {{in addition to the}} basic four variables, is used. Several major findings and conclusions are: (1) There exist economies of scale in <b>thermal</b> power <b>generation</b> in 1964 - 1988, although the magnitude of economies of scale is very small. (2) The rate of technological improvement clearly declined after the period 1971 - 1975. (3) The capacity factor is critical in determining movements in total factor productivity.

25|$|Lower {{positive}} impacts {{are found}} in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment, and forming methane, a greenhouse gas. According to the World Commission on Dams report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired <b>thermal</b> <b>generation</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into <b>thermal</b> <b>generation</b> systems, such as boilers.|$|E
