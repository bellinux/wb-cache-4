40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} significance {{but also the}} immense complexities of Christian discourse on confessing guilt {{within the context of}} climate change. It draws especially on South African discourse on confessing guilt in the context of apartheid. The argument of the essay is twofold: Christians with an enduring large carbon footprint may wish to confess their guilt in this regard, but typically find it difficult to live from God’s liberating forgiveness and are therefore prone to rather desperate efforts to save the world themselves. By contrast, Christians with a small carbon footprint may opt for alternative understanding of salvation, namely in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> from the looming threat of climate change.

40|$|This thesis theorises an {{approach}} to cinematic suspense derived from a set of films that challenge the teleological and redemptive principles of traditional narrative. It is argued that such a challenge is drawn from the need to account for conditions of violence and suffering without recourse to the traditional grounds <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> They set out to question the symbols that underpin a faith in its possibilities. Such films counter these grounds with a form of perpetuated suspense that continually withholds resolution, stressing and destabilising both the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and the affect of its aesthetic representations. Significantly, this thesis examines films from the years following 1989 that confront this central theme within conditions of historical hiatus and the disintegration of ideological certainties occurring {{in the wake of}} European communism. These films, by Kira Muratova, Béla Tarr, Artur Aristakisyan, Alexander Sokurov, Bruno Dumont, Roy Andersson, Ulrich Seidl and Gus Van Sant, present a world in which human beings are always already turned against themselves, placing them in the context of contemporary philosophical aporias that identify the human condition as enigmatic and resisting of itself. They suspend the symbolic structures associated with redemption in order to reconfigure contemporary film as a „realist‟ cinema at the threshold of the interpretative and reconciliatory economies implicit in the soteriological mythology of Western thought. Tracing Paul Ricoeur‟s schematic account of the symbols and myths of a „fallen‟ world, the thesis turns on Jean-Luc Nancy‟s subsequent critique of the insufficiency of myths to properly account for existence. In place of an hermeneutic recovery of the real and its meaning, Nancy‟s „realist‟ philosophy of „sense‟ and its application to the cinema offer an account that speaks less of conflicting narratives <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> than a radical stripping away <b>of</b> its <b>terms,</b> suggesting that it is redemption from the normative <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> that ultimately constitutes the proper question at the heart of these films...|$|R
40|$|Promotion via coupons {{is one of}} wide-spread {{marketing}} tools on Internet. But {{despite the}} growth of E-business printed coupons remain in use. We, therefore, compare the performance of printed and electronic coupons as measured by their redemption rates. The coupons come in different flavours. The consumer can be granted a fixed discount, a certain percentage off the purchase price, or a gift. Therefore, it is also of interest what works better in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and, {{in the case of}} discount offers, how the size of the discount influences the redemption rate. We estimate response functions based on empirical data of 185 coupon campaigns distributed over various print outlets and web sites. Preliminary results indicate that E-coupons did not perform significantly better than off-line coupons. The U-shape <b>of</b> the <b>redemption</b> curve could be confirmed for print coupons...|$|R
5000|$|Anglicans {{believe that}} the only {{effective}} Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and salvation, is God the Son, Jesus Christ. Historical Anglicanism has drawn {{a distinction between the}} intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected." [...] There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between [...] "mediator" [...] and [...] "intercessor", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. Anglican Catholics understand sainthood in a more Catholic or Orthodox way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.|$|R

[...] The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> contemplating sinfuness, <b>redemption,</b> and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity.

5000|$|Part of the British Vice Consul's duties at Mogadore {{involved}} the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> British Nationals and other Christians (usually shipwrecked sailors) from slavery under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> an Anglo/Moroccan treaty. The British Consul at Mogador {{was well known}} for paying high prices to free Christian slaves in North Africa. [...] Upon learning of a wreck involving Christian sailors, Dupuis would send a Moroccan staff member to attempt to locate the crew, who were usually enslaved shortly after reaching shore, as Christian slaves were sought after by Moors and Africans alike. This employee of the Consul would negotiate the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their <b>redemption</b> from their master, usually by paying for their freedom or trading for them. During his tenure as British Vice-Consul in Mogador, Dupuis secured the freedom of many Christian sailors from the hardships of slavery, and in many cases, death. This work was later carried out by his successor in the post.|$|R

40|$|Targeting {{customer}} segments with tailored promotional {{activities is}} {{widely recognized as}} a potential successful strategy to gain more of existing customers’ discretionary spending. Most previous research focuses on the selection of promising customers for targeting and typically ignores the decision of which specific product category to select for inclusion in such targeted promotions. We present an innovative two-stage decision-support tool that assists managers in selecting promising categories from large assortments for inclusion in targeted promotions. To empirically test {{the performance of the}} derived segment-level category promotions, we implemented and validated our decision-support tool in cooperation with a major home-delivery grocery retailer using a large-scale controlled field experiment. Results point to a very successful campaign: our redemption rates are among the highest reported in both academic and managerial literature. What is more, targeted promotions clearly outperform non-targeted ones in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> coupon <b>redemption.</b> Yet, not all targeted promotions change purchase behavior successfully. We show that customers who use a coupon where the most influential “draw" category was promoted engage in true cross-category purchases, resulting in an average extra boost in overall shopping basket size of about 10 percentage points (in €-amount and number of SKUs) vis-à-vis a control group. We therefore show that our procedure is an important decision-support tool that can help managers with making smart decisions regarding which category to promote for which customer. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Journeys <b>of</b> <b>Redemption</b> {{utilizes}} {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> {{to consider how}} the Americas are contextualized topologically and chronologically, and, as such, how these spaces are given narrative meaning. By relying upon a definition <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> that simultaneously considers spiritual deliverance with material recovery, the Americas become, at once, interpretable as contested grounds and promised destinations. Following Chapter One, the "Introduction" to this project, Chapter Two provides the methodological foundation, describing theoretical approaches towards a definition <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> that {{will serve as the}} underlying basis for my argument. The following chapters all apply <b>redemption</b> in readings <b>of</b> films that may be categorized as captivity narratives. Chapter Three considers how Bruce Beresford's 1991 film, Black Robe, utilizes redemption in its depiction of a Jesuit priest's interactions with Indigenous groups (such as the Huron and Iroquois) in seventeenth-century French Canada. Chapter Four examines redemption in the Brazilian film Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês (Nelson Pereira dos Santos, 1971). This film about a nameless Frenchman's captivity among the sixteenth-century Tupinambás, illustrates the ways in which redemption has functioned, and continues to function, as a foundational contributor to colonial and nationalist projects. Chapter Five focuses on Cabeza de Vaca (Echevarría, 1991), a Mexican film recounting Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca's historic sixteenth-century trek across much of North America. The spiritual focus of this film is studied in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> how it both challenges and corroborates the historical Cabeza de Vaca's own accounts <b>of</b> <b>redemption.</b> Chapter Six considers filmic representations of borders and border crossings, thereby examining how the Americas become shaped by distinction and congruence, how the terrain of this hemisphere becomes, at once, the ever receding Promised Land and a space in dire need <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> and exorcism. The French film Le Salaire de la peur (Clouzot, 1953) is here compared to the German film Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (Herzog, 1973) in an attempt to elucidate how both of these texts create senses of displacement through their associations of the Americas with perdition. Finally, Chapter Seven attempts to juxtapose my readings <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> in the contexts of pilgrimage, the Americas, and film...|$|R
40|$|The {{prohibition}} against 2 ̆ 2 clogging the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> 2 ̆ 2 has been {{enforced by the}} courts for centuries, yet the traditional justifications (invoking fairness or unfair bargaining power) offered for this central premise of mortgage law are rather unconvincing, particularly in the commercial context. After describing and critiquing the traditional view, this article lays out an alternative justification for the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> stressing {{the role of the}} law in fostering efficient renegotiation upon default. This view explains why the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> cannot be waived in the initial loan documents, and why it can be waived in subsequent workouts only if the court is convinced of the fairness of the waiver. Moreover, this article demonstrates that, even if the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an efficient term in most mortgages, an adverse selection dynamic may prevent parties from including it in their contracts, thus justifying the judicial insistence that the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> be a mandatory, rather than default, term...|$|R

(211) In one form, ritual may be seen as a “‘blunt tool.’” (212) Bell asserts that ritual power is interpreted as an external power tapped into by whoever holds an office. She maintains that there are three forms of empowerment for those in charge of ritualization: objectification of office, hierarchization of practices, and creating tradition. (211) Furthermore, in some ways ritual defines the self. Tambiah and Bloch in contrast to some other scholars view the formalization of ritual as furthering the divide between one’s sense of self and one’s ritual practices. (216) Bell in part looks at ritual through the lens of individual empowerment. [...] "The person who has prayed to his or her god, appropriating the social schemes of the hegemonic order in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> an individual <b>redemption,</b> may be stronger because these acts are the very definitions of power, personhood, and the ability to act.” (217-8) ...|$|R
