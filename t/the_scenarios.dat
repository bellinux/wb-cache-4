5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} four scenarios {{including the}} prologue. The actions during the prologue determine {{who will be}} the central character in the story, either Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. <b>The</b> <b>scenarios</b> and player characters that follow are determined by the player's actions. There are five different endings per heroine depending on how <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> progress. After each scenario is a save screen and an intermission mode that allows the player to explore without the threat of Scissorman. During the intermission, the player can have conversations with various characters. The next scenario will begin after the required conditions of the intermission are met.|$|E

Reports of the project, which features the likenesses of Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee, date back to August 2009, prior to the series airing.

30|$|Many <b>scenario</b> {{approaches}} use <b>the</b> {{concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> funnel. For example, this concept {{is especially important}} in <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> approach of [39]. The basic idea of <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> funnel is that the farther we gaze from today’s standpoint towards the future the more possibilities are open [29]. In Fig.  1, this idea of the funnel is {{taken into account in}} <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> paths of <b>the</b> illustration. They all start from a “now” point and the range of <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> paths increases with time. Scenario funnels are often used in a way that <b>the</b> most probable <b>scenario</b> is in <b>the</b> middle of the funnel. This idea does not work in Fig.  1 where <b>the</b> possible <b>scenarios</b> are presented in the order in which <b>the</b> most desirable <b>scenarios</b> are at <b>the</b> top.|$|R
30|$|Examining <b>the</b> {{reforestation}} <b>scenario</b> {{showed that}} <b>the</b> carbon emission reductions become greater for <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while no carbon emission reductions were realized for <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> without reforestation throughout the evaluation period of 100  years, and carbon emissions occurred instead. Reforestation {{in the forest}} after harvesting is essential despite the differences in <b>the</b> energy use <b>scenarios</b> in to achieve carbon emission reductions. Reviewing <b>the</b> energy use <b>scenario</b> revealed that <b>the</b> starting time of carbon emission reduction effects varies {{depending on whether the}} energy use is actually implemented, even though it does not have as strong an impact on the results as <b>the</b> reforestation <b>scenario.</b> Moreover, a comparison between <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> with or without reforestation and <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> with or without energy use revealed the characteristic that carbon emission reduction effects become greater for <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while a constant level of carbon emission effects can be expected in both short-term and long-term periods for <b>the</b> <b>scenario</b> with energy use.|$|R
5|$|The {{writer of}} <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> {{was most likely}} Lloyd Lonergan.

5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves - about 10kg of lithium per car. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found sufficient resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use. The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on <b>the</b> <b>scenarios</b> regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E
