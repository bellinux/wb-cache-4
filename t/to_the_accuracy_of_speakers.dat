The research was conducted in KAP Kota Pekanbaru and KAP Medan City. The samples were obtained randomly as many as 79 respondents. The data were analyzed by using Partial Least Square (PLS) techniques with SmartPLS 2. 0 M 3 versions. The results showed that auditor experience did have a significant relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> on giving opinion. Secondly, competence did have a significant relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> on giving opinion. Third, audit risk did have a significant relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> on giving opinion. Fourth, ethics did have a significant relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> on giving opinion. Fifth, adherence pressure did have a significant relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> on giving opinion. Sixth, gender did have a significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> auditors opinion. From the indirect test, the result showed that the variable of auditors professional skepticism was able <b>to</b> strengthen <b>the</b> competence relation and situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> auditors opinion.
