5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, {{at the very beginning}} of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, a major {{lesson for}} the Greeks was the {{potential}} of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious. Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the Polish–Prussian {{alliance}} was subject to a comprehensive study {{as early as the}} 1890s, when Polish historian Szymon Askenazy published his work on the subject (Przymierze polsko-pruskie, 1900) focusing on the diplomatic and international aspects. Askenazy argued that the alliance fell more due to inept Polish diplomacy than to the Prussian realpolitik agenda; this view is not supported by majority of historians, and noted by Jerzy Łojek (who admits that himself, at the same time declaring himself, in his Geneza i obalenie Konstytucji 3 maja (1986) as sharing Askenazy's minority viewpoint). The question of to what degree the alliance was realistic, and to what degree it represented a Prussian diplomatic feint which mislead Commonwealth politicians is still debated by modern historians. Similarly, as Piotr Wandycz has noted, <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> this alliance have been debated by the historians for over a century.|$|E

The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.|$|E

25|$|A Business Process Management {{system is}} quite {{different}} from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation {{on the back of a}} BPM implementation.

The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface. Auxiliary latitudes are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid.|$|E
25|$|In March 1965, Tony Benn, {{the acting}} Postmaster General, wrote to Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, proposing that studies be {{undertaken}} aimed at converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry.

After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; Post, Telecommunications, Savings, Giro and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: Post and Telecommunications. These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.|$|E

25|$|In {{choosing}} the best design for their carriers, the British {{had to consider}} <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> hangar design. There was a choice between open or closed hangar and {{the position of the}} armour. The placing of the strongest deck affected the strength of the hull. The further apart the deck and the keel, the stronger the design. If the flight deck was placed above the main deck then it had to be built to allow for movement with expansion sections. A closed hangar design was the strongest structurally and made for a lighter hull and the RN carried this concept one step further and designed the armoured flight deck to also act as the strength deck without any underlying plating, thus achieving an armoured flight deck on the lowest possible displacement.|$|E
25|$|Sun He {{heard that}} Cai Ying (蔡穎), {{a member of}} his {{personal}} staff, enjoyed playing weiqi and that many of Cai Ying's subordinates also picked up the game and {{spent a lot of time}} playing. As he saw that weiqi was an unproductive activity meant to be a hobby or pastime, he became worried that Cai Ying and the others would become complacent and neglect their duties from playing too much weiqi. He thus came up with an idea to subtly remind and motivate his subordinates. He called for a meeting and asked them to discuss <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> playing weiqi. One of them, Wei Yao (韋曜), went home, wrote an essay on this topic and presented it to Sun He, who had copies of it distributed among his personal staff.|$|E
25|$|For certain applications, {{copper alloy}} {{conductors}} are preferred instead of pure copper, especially when higher strengths or improved abrasion and corrosion resistance properties are required. However, relative to pure copper, the higher strength and corrosion resistance benefits that are offered by copper alloys are offset by their lower electrical conductivities. Design engineers weigh <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> {{the various types}} of copper and copper alloy conductors when determining which type to specify for a specific electrical application. An example of a copper alloy conductor is cadmium copper wire, which is used for railroad electrification in North America. In Britain the BPO (later Post Office Telecommunications) used cadmium copper aerial lines with 1% cadmium for extra strength; for local lines 40lb/mile (1.3mm dia) and for toll lines 70lb/mile (1.7mm dia).|$|E

25|$|In each episode, true {{historical}} dogfights of {{a certain}} battle or war are played out. Pilots from the actual fights are brought in to re-tell their accounts of the battles. Along with the battle, there are occasional scenes that describe the pilot's living conditions or events that have happened outside the battle. Each battle is told by the pilot and a special narrator. CGI effects are used, providing a realistic simulation. The show also describes the aircraft, showing diagrams on screen and taking some time to describe <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> <b>of</b> each plane. It also describes and illustrates the air maneuvers and tactics used by the pilots. Usually, the battles are told by pilots of the winning side of each war or battle. Occasionally, there are other variants brought into a battle besides the planes. For example, a pilot may recount their experience destroying ship fleets, bombing enemy air fields, or dealing with Anti Aircraft fire from the ground, but the process is interrupted by enemy planes. After each battle, the show usually features a short biography about the pilots and the conflicts they were involved in, and then the credits roll.|$|E
