25|$|A spherical contact lens bends light evenly {{in every}} {{direction}} (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. A toric contact lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, {{and as a result}} can correct for astigmatism. Some spherical rigid lenses can also correct for astigmatism. Because a <b>toric</b> <b>lens</b> must have the proper orientation to correct for a person's astigmatism, such a lens must have additional design characteristics to prevent it from rotating away from the ideal alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position. Some toric contact lenses have marks or etchings that can assist the eye doctor or the user in fitting the lens. The first disposable toric contact lenses were introduced in 2000 by Vistakon.|$|E

Case presentation A 53 -year-old woman had undergone <b>toric</b> implantable collamer <b>lens</b> implantation three years earlier. After informed consent was obtained, we performed simultaneous <b>toric</b> implantable collamer <b>lens</b> removal and phacoemulsification with <b>toric</b> intraocular <b>lens</b> implantation.

50|$|With modern {{computer-controlled}} design, grinding {{and polishing}} techniques, good vision corrections can be achieved for even wider angles of view by allowing certain deviations from the toric shape.

50|$|Astigmatism may be {{corrected}} with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. Various considerations involving eye health, refractive status, and lifestyle determine whether one option {{may be better}} than another.

5000|$|A <b>toric</b> <b>lens</b> is a lens with {{different}} optical power and focal length in two orientations perpendicular to each other.

50|$|The {{power of}} a <b>toric</b> <b>lens</b> can be {{specified}} by describing how the cylinder (the meridian that is most different from the spherical power) differs from the spherical power.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether back surface <b>toric</b> scleral <b>lenses</b> stabilized (i. e., returned to their original position after rotation) and how long the return times were. Return time was studied in relation with actual wearing time and comfort; moreover, the performance of the spherical scleral lens was compared with the <b>toric</b> scleral <b>lens</b> design. METHODS: <b>Toric</b> scleral <b>lenses</b> were rotated clockwise and counterclockwise over 60 degrees. Return times and the actual wearing time were recorded. Results were transformed into nasal and temporal return times for symmetry reasons. The present and former types of correction were compared for comfort (ranging from 0 : very poor to 10 : excellent) and regular wearing time. All the subjects attended regular follow-up visits. RESULTS: Forty-three subjects (43 lenses) entered the study. All the lenses returned to the original position within a median of 4 seconds after nasal rotation and 6 seconds after temporal rotation. A significant correlation was found between mean return times and actual wearing time (r = 0. 63). Significant increases in median comfort (from 6 - 8) and median wearing time (from 15 - 16 hours) were demonstrated when the <b>toric</b> scleral <b>lens</b> designs were compared with the former type of correction (both p < 0. 001). Median comfort and median wearing time also increased significantly after changing from spherical scleral <b>lenses</b> to the <b>toric</b> design (from 7 - 8 and from 14 - 16 hours, both p < 0. 001, n = 27 eyes).

50|$|A toric IOL {{is a type}} of <b>toric</b> <b>lens</b> used {{to correct}} preexisting corneal {{astigmatism}} at the time of cataract surgery. This astigmatism can also be treated with limbal relaxing incisions or an excimer laser procedure. About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a toric IOL. Cataract surgery with implantation of a toric IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like toric contact lenses, toric IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the toric IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} how aberration-controlling, customised soft contact lenses corrected higher-order ocular aberrations and visual performance in keratoconic patients {{compared to other}} forms of refractive correction (spectacles and rigid gas-permeable lenses). Methods: Twenty-two patients (16 rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearers and six spectacle wearers) were fitted with standard <b>toric</b> soft <b>lenses</b> and customised lenses (designed to correct 3 rd-order coma aberrations). In the rigid gas-permeable lens-wearing patients, ocular aberrations were measured without lenses, with the patient's habitual lenses and with the study lenses (Hartmann-Shack aberrometry). In the spectacle-wearing patients, ocular aberrations were measured both with and without the study lenses. LogMAR visual acuity (high-contrast and low-contrast) was evaluated with the patient wearing their habitual correction (of either spectacles or rigid gas-permeable contact lenses) and with the study lenses. Results: In the contact lens wearers, the habitual rigid gas-permeable lenses and customised lenses provided significant reductions in 3 rd-order coma root-mean-square (RMS) error, 3 rd-order RMS and higher-order RMS error (p ≤ 0. 004). In the spectacle wearers, the standard <b>toric</b> <b>lenses</b> and customised lenses significantly reduced 3 rd-order RMS and higher-order RMS errors (p ≤ 0. 005). The spectacle wearers showed no significant differences in visual performance measured between their habitual spectacles and the study lenses. However, in the contact lens wearers, the habitual rigid gas-permeable <b>lenses</b> and standard <b>toric</b> <b>lenses</b> provided significantly better high-contrast acuities compared to the customised lenses (p ≤ 0. 006). Conclusions: The customised lenses provided substantial reductions in ocular aberrations in these keratoconic patients; however, the poor visual performances achieved with these lenses {{are most likely to be}} due to small, on-eye lens decentrations...|$|R

Patients and methods: This is a randomized prospective study involving bilateral implantation of a trifocal toric or a bifocal <b>toric</b> <b>lens.</b> At 3  months postoperatively, the subject’s vision was tested both uncorrected and with his/her best distance correction at: distance (4  m), intermediate (63  cm), and near (40  cm). Binocular defocus curves were measured with no correction and with the subject’s best distance correction in place. Quality of vision was measured using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire. Results: A total of 22 patients were enrolled (eleven in each group). There was no statistically significant difference in the absolute change in measured rotation between 1  month and 3  months postoperatively between the two intraocular lens (IOL) groups (P= 0. 98). At 3  months, the postoperative refraction and distance VA by eye were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the measured LCVA between groups (P= 0. 39). The defocus curve showed that at 67  cm, the trifocal <b>toric</b> <b>lens</b> had statistically significantly better VA when compared to the bifocal <b>toric</b> <b>lens.</b> There were no statistically significant differences by group for any of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire scores (P> 0. 26 in all cases).
