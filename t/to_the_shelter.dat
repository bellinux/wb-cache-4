5|$|Because the Goathouse Refuge offers their 300 cats (number as of January 2013) medical {{treatment}} on-site, quality food, toys and comfort {{items such as}} lots of blankets, the cost of maintaining {{is higher than the}} average shelter.

Scarpa's fundraisers use themes such as Burrito Bash, Venetian Carnival, Garden Gourmands, and Mad Hatter's Tea Party.

5|$|Cimon {{then moved}} to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site {{where he wanted to}} meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able to}} retreat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E

25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the bed bug returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|E

The master sculptor also built various columns, pedestals, angels, cherubs and images (including Nossa Senhora da Piedade and São José). The artisan died in 1693, before concluding the altar for the image of Nossa Senhora da Consolação. While a resident at the convent, Father Bartolomeu de Frias Coutinho worked on improving the roads to the chapel in 1695 and decorated the sepulchre tomb, during the Paschal Triduum of Holy Week, and other small works.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dettol, a {{commercial}} cleaning product was tested for its repellent action against adults of Periplaneta americana (L.). Experimental cage was constructed {{with pieces of}} polypropylene plastic material to have a finished form measuring 30 × 30 × 60 cm. Two cardboard shelters (for each trial) were assembled each 10 cm square by size with an opening of 1. 5 × 1. 5 cm to allow for free passage. One of <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> was treated with undiluted Dettol, the other with water (control) prior <b>to</b> placement in <b>the</b> cage. Twenty five adult roaches were released in the cage also provided with water and 50 g dog biscuit at each trial. The cage was placed close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sunlight by midday over seven days observation period {{and the number of}} roaches in and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> were recorded three times by 30 minutes interval. Similar procedure was used when applying 1 : 37 and 1 : 74 dilutions of the product. A highest mean repellency (0. 00 ± 0. 00) was observed in <b>the</b> treated <b>shelter</b> (TS) with undiluted concentration while the least (13. 33 ± 1. 15) was in <b>the</b> control <b>shelter</b> (CS).

At about 14:30 it was agreed between the GOC 52nd (Lowland) Division and the GOC Yeomanry Mounted Division that the 6th Mounted Brigade should attack El Mughar ridge in combination with a renewed assault on Qatra and El Mughar by the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Half an hour later the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry, already in the Wadi Jamus, advanced in column of squadrons extended to four paces across [...] at first trotting then galloping onto {{the crest of the}} ridge.

However, the Ottoman defenders continued to hold El Mughar village until two squadrons of the Berkshire Yeomanry of the 6th Mounted Brigade fighting dismounted, with two battalions of the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade (52nd (Lowland) Division), renewed the attack. Fighting in the village continued until 17:00 when they succeeded in capturing the two crucial fortified villages of Qatra and El Mughar but at a cost of 500 casualties.
