5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a larger}} press corps in Brussels than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> in Brussels shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E

25|$|The WHCD {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized {{as an example}} of the coziness between the White House press corps and the administration. The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps.</b> <b>The</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps,</b> in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press. Increasing scrutiny by bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness.|$|E

However, its passage through the Executive Council was reportedly hastened as a result of the heightened debate on universal suffrage driven by Regina Ip and Anson Chan, undeclared candidates in the Hong Kong Island by-election, 2007.|$|E

His crew included Dave Grant as copilot, two flight engineers, Don Smith and Joe Petrali, 16 mechanics, and two other flight crew. The H-4 also carried seven invited guests from <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> and an additional seven industry representatives. Thirty-six were on board.|$|E
25|$|This {{may have}} been {{ameliorated}} by the winter of 1939, at which point a number of articles about the Norden appeared in the US popular press with reasonably accurate descriptions of its basic workings. But when these were traced back to <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> at the Army Air Corps, the Navy was apoplectic. Instead of accepting it was now in the public domain, any discussion about the Norden was immediately shut down. This drove both the Air Ministry and Royal Navy to increasingly anti-American attitudes when they considered sharing their own developments, notably newer ASDIC systems. By 1940 the situation on scientific exchange was entirely deadlocked as a result.|$|E
25|$|From 40 in 1964, <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> in South Vietnam {{had grown}} to 282 by January 1966. By August that number had jumped to 419. Of the 282 at the {{beginning}} of the year, only 110 were Americans. 67 were South Vietnamese, 26 Japanese, 24 British, 13 Korean, 11 French, and seven German. Of the Americans present, 72 were more than thirty-one years old, and 60 of them were over the age of thirty-six. The same was true of the 143 non-Americans. Correspondents with valid accreditations had to show their credentials in order to receive a card that gave them access to military transportation and facilities. All other correspondents had to present a letter from their editors stating that they represented a bona-fide news-gathering organization which would take responsibility for their conduct. Freelance correspondents were required to produce a letter from one of their clients affirming that agency's willingness to purchase their work.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, Linda Boreman (who had {{appeared}} in the pornographic film Deep Throat as [...] "Linda Lovelace") made public statements that her ex-husband Chuck Traynor had beaten and raped her, and violently coerced her into making that and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of Women Against Pornography. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of Deep Throat. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.|$|E
500|$|Some commentators, while {{noting the}} {{popularity}} of Colbert's dinner speech, were critical of the perceived snubbing he was receiving from <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps,</b> {{even though he was}} the featured entertainer for the evening. The Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin, calling it [...] "The Colbert Blackout", lambasted the traditional media for ignoring Colbert while focusing on the [...] "much safer" [...] topic of President Bush's routine with Bridges. [...] Amy Goodman of Democracy Now noted that initial coverage ignored Colbert entirely. Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin remarked, [...] "It's too hot to handle. [...] was scathing toward Bush and it was absolutely devastating. [...] know how to handle such a pointed and aggressive criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|Voorhis was {{generally}} highly regarded by his colleagues {{and others in}} Washington. Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois considered Voorhis [...] "a political saint", and said of Voorhis that [...] "riven by conscience, he had a compulsion to master every subject that came before the House, and having mastered it, he spoke his mind." [...] Voorhis would make five-minute speeches in the House of Representatives at any opportunity, on matters ranging from local concerns in his district to international monetary issues. The press nicknamed him [...] "Kid Atlas", seeming to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders. <b>The</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> also voted him the most honest congressman, and the fifth most intelligent. However, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes described Voorhis's 1943 resignation from HUAC as the representative being [...] "obbly as usual".|$|E

[...] Palin [...] "and <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> watched the sketch {{in the back of her}} plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{performance}} {{received a}} variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> was negative—both groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen found that Colbert's jokes were [...] "lame and insulting" [...] and wrote that Colbert was [...] "rude" [...] and a [...] "bully". Politician Steny Hoyer felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper The Hill that [...] " [...] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect". Conservative pundit Mary Matalin called Colbert's performance a [...] "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: [...] "I somehow doubt that Bush has never heard these criticisms before". She added, [...] "Comedy can have a political point {{but it is not}} political action".|$|E
500|$|The indignant reporters stridently {{accused the}} Diệm regime of causing the altercation, whereas the police {{claimed that the}} journalists threw the first punch.

In a heated meeting at the embassy, <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>corps</b> demanded that William Trueheart, the acting US Ambassador to South Vietnam {{in the absence of}} the vacationing Frederick Nolting, deliver a formal protest to Diệm on behalf of the American government. Trueheart angered them by refusing to do so and blaming both sides for the confrontation. In his report to Washington, Trueheart asserted that the uniformed policemen had tacitly helped their plainclothed counterparts, but he also had [...] "no doubt that [...] reporters, at least once [...] fracas had started, acted in [...] belligerent manner towards [...] police". Trueheart contended that since the journalists had a long history of bad blood with the Diem regime, their word could not be taken over that of the Vietnamese police.|$|E
