5|$|Despite the {{disparity}} with the Principate, Jones and Elton argue that 4th-century remuneration was attractive {{compared to the}} hard reality of existence at subsistence level that most recruits' peasant families had <b>to</b> <b>endure.</b> Against {{that has to be}} set the clear unpopularity of military service.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after Guest's arrival a young man arrived to {{practise}} in Bulawayo as an advocate, Robert Hudson. So began a friendship that was <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> {{for the rest of}} Hudson's life and through many vicissitudes– in the legal profession, on active service in the First World War, and during the years when they were both members of the Cabinet. Hudson, who for some years was Minister of Justice, became Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady lobbying for future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the high-radiation environment around itself and Jupiter. Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E

50|$|Widespread power {{cuts were}} also {{reported}} {{and at one}} point, 17 of the 31 provinces had <b>to</b> <b>endured</b> reduced power supplies. It was estimated that about 827 000 people were evacuated across 14 provinces. The country's civil affairs ministry estimated that the severe weather affected 67 million people and that the costs were estimated at about 7.8 billion British pounds, 15.8 billion US Dollars or 111 billion Chinese yuan.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted {{seventeen}} weeks; {{the crew had}} <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim Ali, the {{president}} of Malay rights group Perkasa labelled the Chinese in Sibu as ungrateful for not voting for the BN. He claimed that the Chinese in Sibu had not appreciated the development projects and financial allocations offered by BN while the Bumiputera had <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> and compromise with the wish of Chinese community. His statement however, was met with strong opposition from the local community, including the Bumiputera community, and he was dubbed as 'ignoramus' upon his statement.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
60|$|All {{the many}} forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the {{continued}} effects of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several sub-families and families, {{some of which}} are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some <b>to</b> have <b>endured</b> <b>to</b> the present day.|$|R

5|$|Overnight, {{a copy of}} the {{withdrawal}} plan was sent across the river for Urquhart's consideration. Despite the obviously frustrating content, Urquhart knew there was little other choice and radioed Thomas at 08:00 to agree to the plan on the condition it went ahead that night. Meanwhile, the Airborne forces would need <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> another day in their perimeter. More men were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day, but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire.|$|E
5|$|The demands made on Beatrice {{during her}} mother's reign were high. Despite {{suffering}} from rheumatism, Beatrice was forced <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> her mother's love of cold weather. Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment {{in which she}} excelled; however, this did not change her willingness to cater to her mother's needs. Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.|$|E
5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives might have <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> excruciating torture {{for hours and}} even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth. He was sickly as a young child—so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later {{attributed}} his sickness to the poverty his family had <b>to</b> <b>endure.</b> The family moved twice {{while he was still}} young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where he would eventually have his funeral service.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> in {{a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E

5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall.

5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of the}} century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E

Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary {{would be too much}} for the aging Beckham <b>to</b> <b>endure.</b> Supporters of a single primary found they did not have the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Bulge, a German counteroffensive during World War II, {{starting}} December 16, 1944, {{was marked}} by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops, but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had <b>to</b> <b>endure</b> terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.|$|E
