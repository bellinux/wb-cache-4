5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> handles rendering {{and much of}} gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio in-house saved Bungie time as motion capture data {{could be applied to}} the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E

25|$|Computer-controlled {{experiments}} are sometimes also erroneously {{referred to as}} double-blind experiments, since software may not cause the type of direct bias between researcher and subject. Development of surveys presented to subjects through computers shows that bias can easily be built into the process. Voting systems are also examples where bias can easily be constructed into an apparently simple machine based system. In analogy to the human researcher described above, the part of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> provides interaction with the human is presented to the subject as the blinded researcher, while the part of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> defines the key is the third party. An example is the ABX test, where the human subject has to identify an unknown stimulus X as being either A or B.|$|E

Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware. It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running; also, memory usage can be reduced, compared to other distributions, by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services.|$|E
25|$|Rootkit {{detection}} {{is difficult}} because a rootkit {{may be able to}} subvert <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.|$|E

Also antivirus company Avira has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise to work on <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> would protect against potential attacks. The privacy policy for Samsung's Smart TVs has been called Orwellian (a reference to George Orwell and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in 1984), and compared to Telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns.|$|E
25|$|Installing, {{updating}} {{and removing}} software in Linux is typically done {{through the use}} of package managers such as the Synaptic Package Manager, PackageKit, and Yum Extender. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.|$|E
25|$|While the {{hardware}} {{components in the}} Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.|$|E

25|$|Download Play {{allows users}} to play local {{multiplayer}} games with other Nintendo 3DS systems using only one Game Card. Players must have their systems within wireless range (up to approximately 65 feet) of {{each other for the}} guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Download Play on Nintendo 3DS systems is also backward compatible, meaning that it is also available for Nintendo DS games. Unlike Download Play on Nintendo DS, game data, once downloaded to the guest system, is stored on the system's SD card, no longer requiring a re-download for a future game session. Nintendo 3DS games can only transfer a maximum of 32MB of data to other systems while in download play. Other forms of local multiplayer modes require each player to own <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> is currently being used.|$|E
25|$|Open-source {{hardware}} (OSH) {{consists of}} physical artifacts of technology designed and {{offered by the}} open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept {{to a variety of}} components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it – coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, a {{difference}} between hardware and software did not exist. The user and programmer of a computer were one and the same. When the first commercial electronic computer was introduced by IBM in 1952, the machine was hard to maintain and expensive. Putting {{the price of the}} machine aside, it was <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> caused the problem when owning one of these computers. Then in 1952, a collaboration of all the owners of the computer got together and created a set of tools. The collaboration of people were in a group called PACT (The Project for the Advancement of Coding techniques). After passing this hurdle, in 1956, the Eisenhower administration decided to put restrictions on the types of sales AT could make. This did not stop the inventors from developing new ideas of how to bring the computer to the mass population. The next step was making the computer more affordable which slowly developed through different companies. Then they had to develop software that would host multiple users. MIT computation center developed one of the first systems, CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). This laid the foundation for many more systems, and what we now call the Open Source Movement.|$|E

25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do {{not add up to}} 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>that</b> runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory {{is that there is no}} possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E
