5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} <b>title</b> <b>that</b> can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the allegiance of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial <b>title,</b> <b>that</b> of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E
