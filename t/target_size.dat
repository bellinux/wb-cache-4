25|$|In 1964, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} this method {{violated}} the federal constitution, as {{it resulted in}} districts having wildly different populations. State lawmakers implemented a new method that continues to be used today. The Oklahoma House of Representatives must draw new district boundaries within 90 days of the latest Federal Decennial Census. Under the holding of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) districts must be apportioned within a five percent margin of the average <b>target</b> <b>size</b> district {{as determined by the}} U.S. Census population figures divided by the one hundred and one districts. This allows for certain districts to be slightly smaller or larger than others. The Oklahoma House of Representatives draws its own maps of its district lines, which are subject to the approval of both the state senate and the governor. Should the redistricting not occur in the time limits prescribed by law, the lines are determined by a panel of five statewide elected officials.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet 23rd Army {{joined the}} {{offensive}} {{by attempting to}} break through the Finnish lines between Tali and Vuoksi towards Noskua but the repeated Soviet attacks were halted by the highly efficient Finnish artillery. In the end the battle of Tali-Ihantala was a defensive strategic victory for the Finnish army. It blocked the possibility for the Soviet army to break through to the Finnish heartland and the road to Helsinki. Soviet military losses peaked at 28 June when Leningrad Front reported to have lost during that single day over 5 000 soldiers including 1 800 killed in action, over 25% more than in 14 June when they reported to have lost almost 4 000 (including little bit less than 700 killed in action). Especially Finnish artillery concentrated deadly firepower with even 250 artillery pieces sending 2,000 shells to one small <b>target</b> <b>size</b> of just 6 hectares in one minute. Red Army units saw no chances to penetrate through this fire power. The terrain favored the defenders forcing Soviet armor units to narrow death traps.Finnish radio inquiries captured lots of vital important plans of Red Army giving data for joint-fire artillery- air power counterattacks.|$|E

This result is seemingly consistent {{with the concept of}} cortical magnification, and it has beeReonfirmed by many subse-quent authors. Yet it is rarely noted that Aubert and Foerster also observed a loss of the “qual-ity of form. ” We have studied the recognition of numeric characters in foveal and eccentric vi-sion by determining the contrast required for 67 % correct identification. At each eccentricity, the lowest contrast threshold is achieved with a specific stimulus size. But the contrast thresh-olds for these optimal stimuli are not independent of retinal eccentricity as cortical magnifica-tion scaling would predict. With high-contrast targets, however, threshold <b>target</b> <b>sizes</b> were con-sistent with cortical magnification out to 6 °eccentricity. Beyond 6 °,threshold <b>target</b> <b>sizes</b> were larger than cortical magnification predicted.
