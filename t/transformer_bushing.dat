40|$|The {{approach}} {{to the maintenance of}} devices and systems has strongly changed in the last years, thanks to the availability of more and more sophisticated technologies. In particular, when the servicing involves very critical processes, a new interesting strategy is represented by the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). It is based on the continuous observation of some physical parameters which permits to infer the status of the system and thus to detect the need to service it. In this paper a novel monitoring method is proposed.

40|$|The {{evidence}} is growing world wide that EHV level transients caused by fast switching devices are breaking down insulations in power circuit breakers and transformers. The normal substation {{devices such as}} capacitor coupled voltage transformers, potential transformers, and equipment bushings {{do a good job}} at power frequency, but all have significant limitations (resonant frequencies in the ratio versus frequency) for measuring transients with higher frequency content [5]. A measurement technique is under development at the Southern Company (SoCo) to determine the magnitude and characteristic shape of high voltage transients on the 230 kV and 500 kV bus in Georgia Power’s O’Hara Substation. This is in conjunction with the continuing on-line FRA (frequency response analysis) project on the 500 / 230 kV auto-transformer at the O’Hara Substation [1, 2, 3]. The same bushing tap source for the on-line FRA is used to calculate the magnitude and wave shape of the transients at the 230 and 500 kV <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing</b> inputs. A laboratory grade wide bandwidth voltage divider is erected in close proximity to the phase one 230 kV <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing</b> to validate the transient calculations from the FRA software. The de-convolution software is not yet complete to produce corrected time domain transient data from the bushing tap information, but comparisons can be made from the raw time domain data.

The paper also shows that transients of a relatively high frequency content are available on an EHV bus and these same transients travel through the windings to allow the on-line computation of a frequency response analysis (FRA) for the perspective winding.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} on-line monitoring for condenser type bushing of power transformer in order to detect a degradation of bushing and to provide the alarm before bushing failure. For the bushing degradation analysis, the capacitance and power factor of bushing internal insulation are on-line monitored and measured by installing the sensing device at the test tap of bushing. The changing of internal insulation capacitance leads to the change of voltage across tap capacitor and the change of leakage current through bushing insulation at the test tab. Such changes result in the change of power factor or phase angle of leakage current. Thus, the leakage current is additionally detected by installing the Hall Effect sensing device to observe the trend of bushing failure. A total of eight cases of both normal and degraded insulation are investigated. The internal insulation capacitance {{as well as the}} magnitude and phase angle of three phase leakage current were measured and compared with the commissioning value or observed the increasing trend to set the alarm level.

40|$|This work investigates how HV impulses {{affect the}} {{behavior}} of partial discharge (PD) activity and the low voltage dielectric response of oil-impregnated paper insulation. It also investigates how {{the change in the}} PD activity is related to the degradation level of oil-impregnated paper insulation. In order to accomplish these objectives, the ageing were done under three different electrical stress conditions, i. e. HV impulses following an early stage 50 Hz AC PD activity, a prolonged PD activity at a 50 Hz AC stress alone, and a combination of HV impulses and a prolonged PD activity at a 50 Hz AC stress. In order to predict the level of deterioration caused by each ageing stress condition, the dielectric spectroscopy (DS) measurements in a frequency range of 1. 0 mHz to 1. 0 kHz were performed before and after subjecting a test object to each of the ageing stress conditions.      The investigations were mainly done on the test samples consisting of a cavity deliberately introduced between the layers of oil-impregnated paper. Additionally, the investigation about the effect of HV impulses alone on the DS results was done on aged oil-impregnated paper <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing.</b>      The PD experimental results presented in this thesis indicate that HV impulses below the impulse breakdown stress following an early stage AC PD activity will neither cause a significant change in phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns nor damage oil-impregnated paper insulation to a level that can be noticed with visual observations. On the other hand, a prolonged PD activity at a 50 Hz AC stress can cause the change in PRPD patterns by decreasing the total PD charge and the number of PD pulses, but cannot quickly damage the oil-impregnated paper insulation as it would do when it is combined with HV impulses. In addition to that, the results show that the combination of both, HV impulses and a prolonged PD activity at a 50 Hz AC stress can cause a high drop in the PD parameters (total PD charge and number of PD pulses).        The DS results show that HV impulses below the impulse breakdown stress following an early stage 50 Hz AC PD activity will not cause {{a significant increase in the}} real part of the complex capacitance and in the dissipation factor as they will do when they are combined with a prolonged PD activity at a 50 Hz AC stress. Further, the dielectric spectroscopy results obtained every three hours during the ageing of oil-impregnated paper insulation by a prolonged PD activity at an AC stress show that the dissipation factor will increase, but the PD parameters (total PD charge and the repetition rate) will decrease with time of PD application. For a case of the aged oil-impregnated paper <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing,</b> HV impulses of amplitudes up to 200 kV did not result in the change in the dissipation factor curve before removing insulating oil from the bushing. However, after removing about 2. 5 liters of insulating oil from the bushing, HV impulses resulted in the change in the dissipation factor curve. The magnitudes of the dissipation factor curves appeared to be much higher in the middle frequencies region, i. e. the frequencies between 10 mHz and 100 Hz. After refilling the bushing with the same insulating oil, the loss peak shifted towards the higher frequencies.      To understand how the ageing by-products initiated by PDs in the small cavity can modify the geometry of oil-impregnated paper insulation; the model of oil-impregnated paper insulation, comprising of a small cavity, was implemented in Finite Element Method (FEM) software (COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 a). The comparison between the simulation and experimental results show that PD by-products will result in two zones, i. e. aged and unaged zones, and the aged zone will grow with time of PD application; thereby increasing the dissipation factor. On the other hand, in order to interpret  the change in the dissipation factors for the dielectrics in aged oil-impregnated paper <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing</b> after had been exposed to HV impulses, a model of a part of the condenser body (oil-paper insulation) was also implemented in the FEM software (COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 a). To model a condition of low insulating oil level in the bushing, a part of oil subdomains was replaced with the air dielectric properties. A comparison between the simulation and experimental dissipation factor curves indicate that HV impulses will produce the by-products (ions), which will increase the conductivity of air when the bushing has low insulating oil level. On refilling the bushing with the same insulating oil, the insulating oil will take these ions and the reactions between the aged insulating oil by-products (such as acids) and the ions, may produce more ions, thereby increasing further the conductivity of the insulating oil.     QC 20140303 </p...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{the power}} gridtowards a more {{reliable}} and smarter system requires frequent on-line monitoring {{of the power}} components. Power transformers and their bushings are particularly important components in a power transmission system and their insulation degradation may lead to catastrophic failures. Time consuming and costly replacement of these components raise {{the importance of their}} frequent monitoring. A fault in a power <b>transformer</b> <b>bushing</b> can also involve in the failure of the transformer. Therefore, on-line diagnostics of power transformers and their bushings is of great interest. Several methods exist for diagnostics of these components. However, some of them can only be done off-line in maintenance periods, and the existing on-line methods generally provide less information, especially on the internal solid insulation parts. In this project, a new technique for on-line diagnostics of the power transformer and the bushing insulation is proposed. In this technique, natural transients happening in the power system such as lightning and switching surges can be used as stimuli for on-line dielectric response measurements. This technique can provide information on insulation close to what Dielectric Spectroscopy offers in off-line measurements. The wide-ranging frequency content of power system transients is their advantage for being usedas stimuli when measuring the Dielectric Response. The response can have particular signatures due to different types of defects in the insulation varying with frequency. Oil-impregnated paper as a major insulation component in power transformer and its bushing has been investigated in this project. Moisture content and temperature, as two important degradation factors in this type of insulation, have been studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in the diagnostics of the oil-impregnated paper. The results are verified with the dielectric response obtained through commercial instruments. The results show that the proposed technique has the ability to track the changes in dielectric response due to the moisture content and temperature. Measurements were done at both highvoltage (40 kV) and low voltage (10 V) levels, and the corresponding circuit models to achieve reasonable accuracy for the results are discussed. Moving on from the material samples, a further study was done on three service-aged 150 kV bushings to investigate the feasibility of the technique on the diagnostics of power transformer bushings. Their dielectric response measured by the transient stimuli showed good agreement with their response obtained by the commercial instruments. The effect of the transformer winding on the transient response of the bushing is a further aspect of the real conditions for on-line diagnostics. This has been investigated through the simulation of transient models for transformers and bushings, and possible solutions for distinguishing the responses are presented. The proposed new on-line diagnostics technique by utilizing natural transients can provide information about the insulation system in a certain range of frequency without interrupting the operation or requiring an external voltage source. However, the validity range of the results depends on the bandwidth of the applied transients and other measurement considerations. This approach can be valuable in frequent monitoring of dielectric properties of the power transformers and their bushings as a complement to the other available on-line techniques.
