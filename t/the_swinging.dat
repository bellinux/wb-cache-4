5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, <b>The</b> <b>Swinging</b> Stars, became famous across the island. Their music was a dance-oriented version of many kinds of Caribbean and Latin popular music, such as Cuban bolero, Brazilian samba, the merengue from the Dominican Republic, Trinidadian calypso, and American funk.|$|E
5|$|Nakamura {{created the}} music {{while he was}} {{recording}} with Dreams Come True in London, working on their fifth album <b>The</b> <b>Swinging</b> Star. As a gift to Sonic Team, Masato produced an alternate version of the ending theme with Dreams Come True, which {{was included in the}} album they were recording at the time. In 2011, the stage music from Chemical Plant and Casino Night Zone were remixed by Sega for use in Sonic Generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the art department, Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, divided their efforts so that Bell contributed mostly to the film and Wilson to the Series Two episodes. Sets {{constructed}} by Bell especially for Thunderbirds Are Go included the Glenn Field Control Tower and Press Conference Room, the interiors of <b>The</b> <b>Swinging</b> Star, and re-designed versions of various locations on Tracy Island.|$|E
5000|$|In Estonian, kiik means a swing. In a kiiking <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> {{arms are}} made of steel to enable a person to swing 360 degrees going over the [...] of <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> A person is {{fastened}} to <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> base by their feet. To <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> person begins to pump by squatting and standing up on <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> will gain momentum and will, by skillful pumping, take a person over the fulcrum.|$|R
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example is}} a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing {{a person in a}} swing in time with the natural interval of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> (its resonant frequency) makes <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because <b>the</b> energy <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> absorbs is maximized when the pushes match <b>the</b> <b>swing's</b> natural oscillations.|$|R

5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects shots for the film in six months. Their main assignments included the Zero-X launches, re-shot, widescreen launch sequences for the Thunderbird machines, the car chase between Lady Penelope and Parker in FAB1 and the Hood, scenes at <b>The</b> <b>Swinging</b> Star, the Mars shots involving the MEV and the mysterious Rock Snakes, and the ultimate destruction of Zero-X in the climax. Over 300 effects shot were completed with scale models. The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building to experiment with floor-level shots and other more creative camera angles.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{starting}} in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>Swinging</b> London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded {{to take into account}} the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of political change in Britain {{has been dominated}} by <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> is inadequate because it measures only a relationship between changes in party support and sheds no light on the processes of political change. This paper critically examines <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> concept and suggests an alternative standardised measure which eliminates a number of problems {{associated with the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>swing</b> {{installation}} {{came to an}} end in March 2006 {{when both}} <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> and <b>the</b> bar holding it up were removed and a fence installed to block the entrance to the space where <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> was installed. This may have been done to thwart any future attempts to replace <b>the</b> <b>swing,</b> as well as deter homeless people from sleeping in the space between buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Dear Sir, Only {{after the}} fetters of youth have been flung aside can golf enter. Only then can the man know {{the folly of}} his {{adolescent}} belief of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> answering to <b>the</b> man and perceive the joy and {{the truth of the}} complete man answering to <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> And, as <b>the</b> years and the eagles cascade by, the even greater joy is realized when he stands in the bright sunlight of complete fulfillment and comes to realize that <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> is <b>the</b> man.The <b>swing</b> is <b>the</b> man.

Doctor Golf is more mystical still: <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> by its very nature transcends the human form. <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> is there when you pass on... <b>The</b> <b>swing,</b> sir...is like <b>the</b> blue in the sky, immutable, eternal, indeed transcendental.|$|R
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne {{walking out of the}} mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E
50|$|From {{his study}} of cometary atmospheres, he is {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} <b>the</b> <b>Swings</b> bands and <b>the</b> <b>Swings</b> effect. Swings bands are emission lines resulting from the presence of certain atoms of carbon; <b>the</b> <b>Swings</b> effect was discovered {{with the aid of a}} slit spectrograph and is attributed to fluorescence resulting partly from solar radiation.|$|R
50|$|For a {{pendulum}} <b>swing</b> at <b>the</b> North Pole it is {{shown that the}} surface velocity vectors of the Earth underneath one side of <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing</b> are directed {{in opposition to the}} velocity vectors underneath the other side of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> (see Figure 1). The Earth's rotation can then be observed in relation to <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing.</b> At <b>the</b> North Pole the support-point of <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing</b> is located on the axis of rotation of the Earth. No matter what vertical orientation is established by the plane of <b>the</b> <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> relative velocity vectors of the Earth's surface on opposite sides and equidistant from the center point of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> will be in opposition. The Earth turns underneath the plane of <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing</b> that is established.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>swing</b> span weighed 670 LT, {{the weight}} of iron in the piers 922 LT, with 770 LT of iron in <b>the</b> girders. <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> span opening was over 100 ft in width, with a height above high water when closed of over 15 ft, <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> pier {{included}} a river jetty 200 ft long.|$|R
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E

2500|$|A {{familiar}} {{experience of}} both parametric and driven oscillation is {{playing on a}} swing. Rocking back and forth pumps <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> as a driven harmonic oscillator, but once moving, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> can also be parametrically driven by alternately standing and squatting at key points in <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> arc. This changes moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> and hence <b>the</b> resonance frequency, and children can quickly reach large amplitudes provided that they have some amplitude to start with (e.g., get a push).

40|$|The {{decisions}} of the Court are partially grounded in {{the ideology of the}} justices themselves, which is the attitudinal model of the Court. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice on the Supreme Court has a substantial effect in determining the ideological direction of the Court over time. If the attitudinal model of the Court is correct, then <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice on the Court has a disproportionate amount of influence on the direction of the Court over time. I examine the influence of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justices, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote on <b>the</b> Rehnquist Court and Justice Anthony Kennedy, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote on <b>the</b> Roberts Court. Previous literature has identified <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice, but only to determine how powerful that justice is relative to the other justices on the Court. My manuscript not only establishes <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice and the power that they wield on the Court, but also determines how that power is sustained over time. This manuscript examines 5 - 4 Supreme Court decisions since O'Connor's appointment to analyze O'Connor's roles as <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote and {{determine the extent to which}} her political ideology as defined under the attitudinal model aligns with the direction of the Supreme Court During her tenure. I also look at the 5 - 4 decisions since Justice Kennedy joined the Court to determine his role on the Court during the period that Kennedy and O'Connor served concurrently, as well as Kennedy's position as <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote since O'Connor's departure...|$|R
