25|$|After 2003, Ray {{was a hot}} commodity. NFL scouts {{were known}} to be looking at Ray, and during the {{off-season}} Ray was able <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New York Jets. The loss of the star quarterback dismayed Eskimos fans, but this was tempered with calm knowing that Maas was around to fill the void in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Doubts {{were raised}} {{throughout}} the season with serious support coming from the four teams likely to be axed, Counties Manukau, Northland, Manawatu, and Tasman, and their supporters, while the financial sustainability of the two unions who were to be promoted to the new first division was questioned. On 11 December the New Zealand Rugby Union decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 14 team Air New Zealand Cup and the 12 team Heartland Championship format through 2010.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May the {{shut down}} continued. The New Progressive Party held {{a meeting and}} decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 5.5% tax proposal, stating that there wouldn't be any type of negotiation. Another meeting between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Governor ended in dispute with the Governor leaving less than 15 minutes after the meeting started. Protests were held also {{in front of the}} main offices of Popular, Inc. in Hato Rey and the Capitol.|$|E

A minority of GNU/Linux distros are recognized as completely free, however like kFreeBSD vanilla Linux kernel contains binary blob device drivers. This is solved by Linux-libre.|$|R
25|$|That same {{afternoon}} many prelates {{and others}} from the French faction met at the Convent of the Carmelites, and discussed {{the question of how}} a new pope would be elected. Representatives of the University of Paris were eager that the entire Council should participate in the election, pointing out that many people were already saying that the College of Cardinals was full of Frenchmen, and that a French pope was sure to be elected; only if everyone participated could a convincing election be achieved. Others wanted <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decree issued by Simon de Cramand on 10 May, assigning the task to the cardinals, in accordance with Canon Law. The meeting ended, however, without a decision.|$|E
25|$|John Howard {{had been}} an MP since 1974, leader of the Liberal Party since 1995 (he was {{previously}} leader from 1985 to 1989), and Prime Minister since March 1996. He turned 65 in July 2004, and is more than 20 years older than Mark Latham. Howard {{is by far the}} most experienced politician in Australian federal politics and is considered a master of political strategy, a reputation which was enhanced during the 2004 campaign. Although most commentators agreed that he did not perform well in the debate with Latham, his dogged campaigning on interest rates, economic certainty and national security was effective in persuading voters in marginal seats <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Coalition.|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} began, however, Spielberg grew {{reluctant to}} continue with Jaws, in fear of becoming typecast as the [...] "truck and shark director". He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox's Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project, saying that [...] "after , you {{can make all the}} films you want". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5million and a shooting schedule of 55days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.|$|E
50|$|DCE/RPC {{was under}} development, but the POSIX {{committee}} had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group {{had to make}} a decision about what <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with,</b> and unfortunately <b>the</b> final POSIX threads were different from their selection.|$|R
5000|$|Commitment: Unlike {{the other}} two blocks, {{commitment}} involves a conscious decision <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> one another. <b>The</b> decision to remain committed is mainly determined by the level of satisfaction that a partner derives from the relationship.

5000|$|However, {{many would}} label the {{tailback}} above as quarterback, {{even though the}} position is clearly the deepest back! Until 1960, the formation above would have been called a double wing, and the tailback labeled a fullback, there being {{no need for the}} tailback designation when the backs assume so few intermediate depths. However, the deep back position above is usually occupied by a player who habitually plays QB, so the habitual position name tends <b>to</b> <b>stick,</b> as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "extra tight end".|$|R
500|$|In 2010, {{speculation}} arose that Richardson {{would leave}} the show, due to his participation in ITV ice skating competition Dancing on Ice. Richardson said [...] "I'm not leaving, I'm staying put". He added his participation in the reality television series was for [...] "fun", and stating: [...] "I still want to stay at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there" [...] {{because he did not}} think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects. However, he later revealed he was not sure executive producer Paul Marquess would renew his contract. In November 2010, Richardson commented on his future with the show, branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it. Richardson stated: [...] "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted to keep me on. I'm hoping <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show no matter what." ...|$|E
500|$|UT {{fans were}} unhappy with ABC's {{television}} {{coverage of the}} event. The network elected <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma vs. Texas A game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A game through the final down and then ran threefull minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14–0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying [...] "And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which has pretty much already been decided." [...] ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without coverage {{for much of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, {{and it was as}} complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for Medúlla.|$|E
50|$|After {{what was}} a break through year in 2010, Henry joined the New Zealand Breakers {{for the first three}} games of the 2010-11 NBL season as a {{replacement}} for Kirk Penney. Upon Penney's returned, Henry was asked <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> around <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Breakers as a training player and he did so for the entire season, showing his commitment and dedication. This and a solid 2011 season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Saints earned him a full contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Breakers for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 NBL seasons.|$|R

I {{was engaged in}} an aesthetic, in {{the expansion of the}} palette — what shades could be added in working with space and style," [...] he says. Leonardo Shapiro concludes that [...] "Lyubimov is probably best known for his daring theatrical adaptations of poetry and novels and his successful (and sometimes unsuccessful) run-ins with Soviet Premiers and Ministers of Culture over forbidden material." ...|$|R

As he crossed the Pacific coast of North America, the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico, informed Mercury Control in Florida that a yaw thruster was causing attitude control problems. Glenn later recalled, this problem [...] "was <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> me for <b>the</b> rest of the flight." ...|$|R
500|$|Genesis was {{announced}} in early-August 2005 on TNA's official website. It was planned for November13 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. This event caused a change in TNA's PPV schedule, as the November 2004 PPV event was titled Victory Road. This was a small change as TNA intended <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other names used for PPVs throughout 2005. A promotional poster for the event was released prior by TNA featuring Jeff Hardy. TNA created a section covering the event on their website. A thirty-minute pre-show was slatted to take place prior to the telecast featuring two wrestling matches: Shark Boy versus the debuting Nigel McGuinness, and The Diamonds in the Rough (David Young, Elix Skipper, and Simon Diamond) versus Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens). TNA promoted the debut of a newly signed wrestler to occur at Genesis, which the promotion called a [...] "major acquisition." [...] Genesis was dedicated to World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Eddie Guerrero, who died {{the day of the}} event.|$|E
500|$|Having parted with Milwaukee, Nashville {{entered into}} a {{four-year}} player development contract with the Oakland Athletics that runs from 2015 through 2018. The Sounds also adopted a new color scheme, set of logos, and uniforms before the 2015 season. The team hired sports design firm Brandiose to create their new visual identity. At one point, the firm was asked to explore new team nicknames which included [...] "Platinums", [...] "Hits", [...] "FireFlies", [...] "Picks", [...] "DrumSticks", and [...] "Roosters". Nashville chose <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sounds moniker, but elected to embrace a new color scheme that originally included Broadway Burnt Orange, Sunburst Tan, Neon Orange, and Cash Black. However, the team returned to the previous red and black color scheme, {{with the addition of}} platinum silver as an accent color, {{before the start of the}} season following mixed feedback from team fans. The new logos incorporated elements that reflect Nashville's [...] "Music City" [...] nickname, such as guitars, guitar picks, and a guitar's sound hole, as well as neon signs such as those in the city's Broadway entertainment district.|$|E
500|$|The Buccaneers {{doubled the}} size of their {{scouting}} staff from two to four, hoping to get more mileage out of the later rounds of the draft. Greg Roberts was the 1978 Outland Trophy winner, and blocked for 1978 Heisman Trophy winner Billy Sims. The Buccaneers had him rated as the best lineman in the draft, and expected him to have been selected long before the second round, where the Buccaneers had their highest selection. He is believed to have fallen to the second round due to an inability to pass-block, having played at the run-heavy University of Oklahoma. This resulted in a poor performance at the Senior Bowl. Gordon Jones, with a 4.59 time in the 40-yard dash, drew pre-draft comparisons to Lynn Swann, but dropped to the second round due to concerns over his speed. He was the third receiver selected overall. [...] Roberts and Jones both left the Buccaneers after four seasons. Jerry Eckwood and Rick Berns were selected to address injury problems at running back. Eckwood had been second in the nation in rushing (behind Ricky Bell) before being injured in 1975. Berns was at the time the leading rusher in Nebraska history. Eckwood and Berns impressed McKay enough in mini-camp that he traded Louis Carter away. Gene Sanders played for several seasons, after successfully converting to offensive tackle. Twelfth-round selection Dave Logan, the lowest-round draft selection <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team, went on {{to become one of the}} Buccaneers' best and most popular players.|$|E

50|$|Also, 'Kong Girls' are superficial. They {{evaluate}} and choose boyfriends by auditing their economic/financial statuses and family backgrounds. They may not truly love their partners but still continue <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> them, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> objective of siphoning {{some of their}} wealth. They believe that the richer their boyfriends, the more affection they can receive from them. Assets become the only factor in determining how deep their love is.|$|R
50|$|Griffin {{was widely}} {{projected}} to be the No. 2 pick of the draft, but the St. Louis Rams—the team originally holding the pick—had already selected Sam Bradford to be their long-term starting quarterback <b>with</b> <b>the</b> No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. Wanting <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> Bradford, <b>the</b> Rams decided to deal the pick prior to <b>the</b> draft, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins perceived as the most interested bidders. After a brief bidding process, the Redskins acquired the pick by giving the Rams four high-value draft picks over three years: their first-round picks in 2012 (No.6 overall), 2013 (No.22 overall), and 2014 (No.2 overall), {{as well as their}} second-round pick (No.39 overall) in 2012.|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, {{voters in}} a 24:1 margin {{approved}} a $150 million bond issue following a campaign by Mayor Ilus W. Davis {{to move the}} city's main airport to an expanded Mid-Continent.

2500|$|Paul {{moved to}} Chicago in 1934, where he {{continued}} to perform on radio stations WBBM and WLS. He met pianist Art Tatum, whose playing influenced him <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> guitar rather than original plans of taking on the piano. His first two records were released in 1936, credited to [...] "Rhubarb Red", Paul's hillbilly alter ego. He also served as an accompanist for a few other bands signed to Decca. During this time he began adding different sounds and adopted his stage name of Les Paul.|$|E

Gary, who regularly played basketball, would often take his younger sibling with him when he played. At age 7, Joey chose <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sport instead of playing soccer, his father's favorite sport. He said, [...] "In soccer, there's too many people on the field, and you don't get your time to shine." ...|$|E

50|$|Markham had {{no great}} {{conviction}} for a naval career, but accepted the constraints it placed upon him {{in return for}} the opportunities it presented to further his other interests. He followed the advice he had been given <b>to</b> join and <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> navy, although he suffered from seasickness and disliked the customary cruelty of service punishments. However, his austere upbringing had better suited him to the rigours of navy life than had his cousin's.|$|R
5000|$|The new Maidstone {{kept the}} same badge. Unlike some clubs, Maidstone have stayed away from 'logo' type badges, instead <b>sticking</b> <b>to</b> {{tradition}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same club badge being displayed for their whole existence.

2500|$|Manhunt 2 was {{released}} for PSP, PS2 and Wii in the US on 31 October, with an M rating. The very next day, 1 November, {{a method that}} removed the blurring effect on the PSP and PS2 versions {{was released}} {{by a group of}} PSP crackers. A Wii version of the blur removal soon followed. [...] Leland Yee and the Parents Television Council demanded that Manhunt 2 be re-rated AO, but after examining the situation, the ESRB concluded it was not Rockstar's fault that these hacks could be used and decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> M rating.|$|E
2500|$|Stockwell and Knightley, {{who wished}} <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} plan, opposed this. Stockwell {{was always in}} favour of rigidly following already agreed to plans, and was most reluctant to see any changes, whereas Beaufre was all for changing plans to match with changed circumstances. The differences between Stockwell and Beaufre were summarized by the American historian Derek Varble as: [...] "Stockwell favored existing plans; their methodical construction and underlying staff work reduced risks. Beaufre, by contrast an opportunist, saw plans merely {{a means to an}} end, without much inherent value. For him, altered circumstances or assumptions provided adequate justification to jettison part or all of the original plan".|$|E
2500|$|Despite earlier {{comments}} by Carruthers that [...] "Reese never wavered in {{her commitment to}} Bianca" [...] and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on [...] "turning" [...] Reese bisexual. [...] "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — {{would be kind of}} insane," [...] said Pratt. [...] "So we thought about making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> message." ...|$|E
50|$|The Democratic Party in Eastern and Midwestern cities had {{a strong}} German Catholic base that was alienated by free silver and inflationist panaceas. They showed little enthusiasm for Bryan, {{although}} many were worried that a Republican victory would bring prohibition into play. The Irish Catholics disliked Bryan's revivalistic rhetoric and worried about prohibition as well. However their leaders decided <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> Bryan, since <b>the</b> departure of so many Bourbon businessmen from the party left the Irish increasingly in control.|$|R
2500|$|Matthew Leyland of Sight & Sound {{reviewed}} the DVD released in 2006, [...] "Miyazaki's family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning <b>to</b> end... what <b>sticks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> viewer is the every-kid {{credibility of the}} girls' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings." [...] Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film, but noted that the disc lacked {{a look at the}} film's production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.|$|R
40|$|In the United States in {{the last}} few years there has {{developed}} a notion of “strategic human resource management” (HRM). As with other high-sounding phrases in the management of people, first reactions are likely to divide between “let's have some of it” to “it won't work here”, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latter possibly predominating. Where American pragmatism inclines towards trying new things to see if they work, British pragmatism tends <b>to</b> mean <b>sticking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actual and the evidently possible. Nevertheless, reviewing ideas which run ahead of practice can, on occasion, be useful in suggesting new possibilities. This article will review the implications of “strategic HRM” and ask whether it has any relevance to some of the issues which currently exercise personnel managers in the UK — notably, decentralising the personnel function and increasing workforce flexibility...|$|R
