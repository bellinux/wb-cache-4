25|$|Mark's account (which in the {{earliest}} extant manuscripts) ends abruptly and claims that the women <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> The Gospels of Matthew and Mark do not present any further involvement at the tomb. Luke describes Peter as running to the tomb to check for himself, and John adds that the Beloved Disciple did so too, the beloved disciple outrunning Peter.|$|E
25|$|After the Anschluss, {{his brother}} Paul left almost {{immediately}} for England, {{and later the}} US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter {{with whom he had}} had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for Rassenschande (racial defilement). He <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a {{returning}} warrior, told Bad Man (also {{known as}} Cranky Man) {{that he had}} left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When {{he went back to}} retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.|$|E

30|$|Productivity under evaluation: {{this might}} have {{influenced}} the experiment results since subjects tend to think they are being evaluated by experiment results.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, Addams read in a {{magazine}} about the new idea of starting a settlement house. She decided to visit the world's first, Toynbee Hall, in London. She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E
2500|$|... "The young {{brother of}} Crazy Horse (Little Hawk) {{was on a}} trip where now is Utah, {{and there he was}} killed by some white settlers. [...] They were having some trouble with the Indians there. When Crazy Horse learned that his brother was killed he took his wife with him and went away but <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> where he was going. [...] He was gone for a long time. [...] He went to the place where his brother was killed and camped in the woods where he could see the settlement. [...] He stayed there nine days. [...] Every day he would look around and when he saw someone he would shoot him. [...] He killed enough to satisfy and then he came home." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the inquest into Kopechne's death, Kennedy {{testified that}} he left the party at [...] "approximately 11:15 p.m." [...] When he {{announced}} {{that he was about to}} leave, Kopechne told him [...] "that she was desirous of leaving, if I would be kind enough to drop her back at her hotel." [...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown." [...] Kopechne <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> that she was leaving with Kennedy, and left her purse and hotel key at the party.|$|E
60|$|Being <b>told</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{had seen}} his master, {{he was about to}} leave the hut in quest of him when he was {{collared}} by several stout men, and placed forcibly in front of a Russian with a huge red beard, who appeared to be the least exhausted of the party.|$|R

"As I have also, several times, Lady, {{which may}} explain to you what Ana here thinks so wonderful, namely that I should have learned what they said {{together}} when {{he thought they were}} alone, which, as I have <b>told</b> him, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can ever be, at least in Egypt, the land of listening gods----" ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was here}} that the third Selma to Montgomery march ended on March 25, 1965, with 25,000 protesters {{at the foot of}} the capitol steps on Dexter Avenue. [...] Prominent protesters {{included}} Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, John Lewis, James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, and Joan Baez. [...] A delegation from the protestors attempted to see Governor George Wallace to give him a petition that asked for an end to racial discrimination in Alabama. [...] The governor had sent word that he would see the delegation, but they were denied entry to the capitol grounds twice and <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would be let through.

2500|$|In early December 2003, Passion of the Christ co-producer Stephen McEveety {{provided}} {{the film to}} Archbishop Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, the pope's secretary. Archbishop Dziwisz returned the film to McEveety {{and said he had}} watched it with John Paul II. On December 16, Daily Variety reported that the pope had seen the film, and on December 17, The Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan reported that John Paul II had said: [...] "It is as it was," [...] sourcing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz. National Catholic Reporter journalist John Allen published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official. The following day, Reuters and the Associated Press each independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources. On December 24, an anonymous Vatican official told Catholic News Service, [...] "There was no declaration, no judgment from the pope." [...] On January 9, John Allen defended his earlier reporting, saying that his official source was adamant about the veracity of the original story. In a January 18 column, Frank Rich interviewed the Italian translator who quoted Dziwisz as saying that the pope called the film [...] "incredible" [...] and said [...] "it is as it was." [...] Rich attacked the marketing of the film and suggested Dziwisz wielded too much influence over the pope. The next day Archbishop Dziwisz told CNS, [...] "The Holy Father <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> his opinion of this film." [...] This denial resulted in a round of commentators who accused the film producers of fabricating a papal quote to market their movie.|$|E

5000|$|We were {{threatened}} with arrests, {{assault and battery}} of our spouses, loved ones and friends. We {{were threatened}} with INDEFINITE detention without trial.

6000|$|... "By the way," [...] Jethro said, [...] "we {{have not}} heard yet how it was that you were together. We heard of your being carried off, but old Lyptis <b>told</b> me that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had seen aught of you." ...|$|R
60|$|Not without {{hopes of}} the first, though, as James <b>told</b> him, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would have nourished them save himself, Louis set forth for Little Northwold, {{with the same}} valour which had made him the {{champion}} of the Marksedge poacher. He found the old gentleman good-natured and sympathizing, for he liked the warm friendship of 'the two boys,' and had not the most remote idea of their disputing his verdict.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there were}} {{shuffling}} steps outside and voices. The door was opened by Mrs. O'Brien. Old Clymer crossed the threshold. He was sober, haggard, grieved. He had been <b>told.</b> <b>No</b> <b>one</b> spoke {{as he approached}} Rose's bedside.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Now I swear I {{told you}} things I <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else. You lured {{me into a}} compact by which we were to have no secrets from one another. We were to tell one another everything, I didn't notice that {{you never told me}} anything.|$|E
60|$|I have <b>told</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> about it, should perhaps make few believe, But I {{think it}} over now that life looms dull and years bereave, How blank we stood at our bright wits' end, two frail barks in distress, How self-regard in her was slain by her large tenderness.|$|E

But this year they've been really strict for some reason. I can only presume the show hasn't got as big a budget as they had last year.

5000|$|On Thursday, March 3, Barrett {{returned}} to the Peoples Grocery with a police officer and were met by Calvin McDowell.
