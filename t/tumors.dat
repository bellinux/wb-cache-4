5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary <b>tumors</b> were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary <b>tumors</b> eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary <b>tumors,</b> apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in <b>tumors</b> larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and <b>tumors</b> that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of <b>tumors,</b> including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for <b>tumors</b> using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the <b>tumors</b> were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The <b>tumors</b> may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney <b>tumors</b> (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly <b>tumors</b> in other organs and tissues. These <b>tumors</b> often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney <b>tumors</b> found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 <b>tumors</b> have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney <b>tumors,</b> which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5000|$|Cryoablation of <b>tumor</b> induces {{necrosis}} of <b>tumor</b> cells. The immunotherapeutic {{effect of}} cryoablation of <b>tumor</b> {{is the result}} of the release of intracellular <b>tumor</b> antigens from within the necrotized <b>tumor</b> cells. The released <b>tumor</b> antigens help activate anti-tumor T cells, which destroy remaining malignant cells. Thus, cryoablation of <b>tumor</b> elicits a systemic anti-tumor immunologic response.|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} the study of <b>tumor</b> {{angiogenesis}} within the rabbit brain is presented. Implantation of the VX 2 carcinoma provides a reproducible <b>tumor</b> accompanied by angiogenesis. The authors report the sequential growth, histology, <b>tumor</b> neovascularization, and vascular permeability of this <b>tumor</b> following its intracerebral implantation. <b>Tumor</b> angiogenesis correlates with the rapid and logarithmic intracerebral <b>tumor</b> growth. The proliferation of blood vessels in the <b>tumor</b> and the organization of <b>tumor</b> cells around <b>tumor</b> vessels are described. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (detected by Evans blue leakage) starts {{in the early stages of}} <b>tumor</b> development and becomes prominent as the <b>tumor</b> vasculature and size increase. This model is useful for experimental studies of angiogenesis...|$|R
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain <b>tumors</b> are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain <b>tumors</b> outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain <b>tumors</b> by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Adrenal <b>tumors</b> are {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic <b>tumors</b> found during medical imaging. They {{are seen in}} around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most cases}} they are benign adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate <b>tumors.</b> This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of <b>tumors</b> express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by <b>tumors</b> have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into <b>tumors</b> called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

40|$|Most {{patients}} with rectal cancer receive neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT), causing a variable decrease in <b>tumor</b> mass. We evaluated the prognostic impact of pathologic parameters reflecting <b>tumor</b> response to RCT, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Seventy-six rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant RCT between 2006 and 2009 were included. We studied the association between disease-free survival (DFS) and the "classical" clinicopathologic features as well as <b>tumor</b> deposits, circumferential resection margin (CRM), Dworak regression grade, and <b>tumor</b> and nodal downstaging. Patients with <b>tumor</b> downstaging had a longer DFS (p = 0. 05), indicating a more favorable prognosis when regression {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in <b>tumor</b> infiltrative depth, referred to as <b>tumor</b> shrinkage. Moreover, <b>tumor</b> downstaging was significantly associated with larger CRM and nodal downstaging (p = 0. 02), suggesting that shrinkage of the primary <b>tumor</b> was associated with a decreased nodal <b>tumor</b> load. Higher Dworak grade did not correlate with <b>tumor</b> downstaging, nor with higher CRM or prolonged DFS. This implies that <b>tumor</b> mass decrease was sometimes due to fragmentation rather than shrinkage of the primary <b>tumor.</b> Lastly, the presence of <b>tumor</b> deposits was clearly associated with reduced DFS (p = 0. 01). Assessment of <b>tumor</b> shrinkage after RCT via <b>tumor</b> downstaging and CRM is a good way of predicting DFS in rectal cancer, and shrinkage of the primary <b>tumor</b> is associated with a decreased nodal <b>tumor</b> load. Assessing regression based on the amount of <b>tumor</b> in relation to stromal fibrosis does not accurately discern <b>tumor</b> fragmentation from <b>tumor</b> shrinkage, which is most likely the reason why Dworak grade had less prognostic relevance...|$|R
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous <b>tumors</b> occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney <b>tumors</b> similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{results were}} obtained by serial investigation of <b>tumor</b> vessels in a transparent chamber in rat skin: 1) Normal vessels and <b>tumor</b> vessels tended to be disturbed by the administration of bleomycin. Cyclophosphamide therapy begun {{at an early stage}} of <b>tumor</b> when the vascular supply was copious resulted in improvement of the irregular pattern and size variation of vessels. Moreover, the central <b>tumor</b> mass regressed. Chemotherapy applied at an advanced stage of <b>tumor</b> when the circulation was sluggish and scatterd <b>tumor</b> necrosis was present did not cause any <b>tumor</b> regression. Moreover, <b>tumor</b> necrosis increased. 3) Prolongation of survival in tumor-bearing rats and <b>tumor</b> regression due to cyclophosphamide were significantly enhanced by the additional use of high pressure oxygen with the drug. Microscopic observation of <b>tumor</b> vessels in vivo indicated that this combination therapy produced favorable conditions in the <b>tumor</b> microcirculatory system. These results clarify the relationship between <b>tumor</b> microcirculation and <b>tumor</b> growth, as well as the therapeutic effects of anti-cancer agents...|$|R
5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown <b>tumors.</b> In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the <b>tumors</b> has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>tumors</b> {{can include}} trichodiscomas (<b>tumors</b> {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the <b>tumors,</b> other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (buccal mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney <b>tumors</b> or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that cancer {{is not merely a}} disease of <b>tumor</b> cells, but a disease of imbalance, in which stromal cells and <b>tumor</b> microenvironment play crucial roles. Extracellular matrix (ECM) as the most abundant component in <b>tumor</b> microenvironment can regulate <b>tumor</b> cell behaviors and tissue tension homeostasis. Collagen constitutes the scaf-fold of <b>tumor</b> microenvironment and affects <b>tumor</b> microen-vironment such that it regulates ECM remodeling by collagen degradation and re-deposition, and promotes <b>tumor</b> infiltra-tion, angiogenesis, invasion and migration. While collagen was traditionally regarded as a passive barrier to resist <b>tumor</b> cells, it is now evident that collagen is also actively involved in promoting <b>tumor</b> progression. Collagen changes in <b>tumor</b> microenvironment release biomechanical signals, which are sensed by both <b>tumor</b> cells and stromal cells, trigger a cascade of biological events. In this work, we discuss how collagen can be a double-edged sword in <b>tumor</b> progression, both inhibiting and promoting <b>tumor</b> progression at different stages of cancer development...|$|R
40|$|In human breast cancers, <b>tumor</b> {{infiltration}} by <b>tumor</b> associated macrophages (TAMs) {{correlates with}} multiple markers of poor prognosis: higher <b>tumor</b> macrophage counts {{are associated with}} higher <b>tumor</b> grade, higher <b>tumor</b> vascular density, and reduced overall survival [1].

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary <b>tumors</b> are five times more likely to bleed than other <b>tumors</b> in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but <b>tumors</b> develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. <b>Tumors</b> may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger <b>tumors</b> are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tumor</b> {{angiogenesis}} {{is necessary}} for solid <b>tumor</b> progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting <b>tumor</b> blood vessels is an important strategy for cancer therapy. Especially, it would give large benefit to head and neck cancer patients if ideal anti-angiogenic drug is developed. <b>Tumor</b> blood vessels {{have been shown to}} differ from their normal counterparts, for example, by changes in morphology. An important concept in <b>tumor</b> angiogenesis is that <b>tumor</b> endothelial cells are assumed to be genetically normal, even though these endothelial cells are structurally and functionally abnormal. To date, many anti-angiogenic drugs have been developed, but it has been also reported to cause toxic side effects. To develop ideal anti-angiogenic therapies, understanding <b>tumor</b> endothelial cell abnormalities is important. We have isolated <b>tumor</b> endothelial cells from mouse <b>tumor</b> xenografts and have shown that <b>tumor</b> endothelial cells are abnormal. <b>Tumor</b> endothelial cells upregulate many genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor. <b>Tumor</b> endothelial cells are also more sensitive to EGF. Unexpectedly, <b>tumor</b> endothelial cells were cytogenetically abnormal. In marked contrast, freshly isolated normal endothelial cells were diploid.
