6000|$|This simple {{accident}} of {{falling in love}} is as beneficial as it is astonishing. It arrests the petrifying influence of years, disproves cold-blooded and cynical conclusions, and awakens dormant sensibilities. Hitherto the man had found it a good policy to disbelieve the existence of any enjoyment which {{was out of his}} reach; and thus he turned his back upon the strong sunny parts of nature, and accustomed himself to look exclusively on what was common and dull. He accepted a prose ideal, let himself go blind of many sympathies by disuse; and if he were young and witty, or beautiful, wilfully forwent these advantages. He joined himself to the following of what, in the old mythology of love, was prettily called nonchaloir; and in an odd mixture of feelings, a fling of self-respect, a preference for selfish liberty, and a great dash of that fear with which honest people regard serious interests, kept himself back from the straightforward course of life among certain selected activities. And now, all of a sudden, he is unhorsed, like St. Paul, from his infidel affectation. His heart, which has been ticking accurate seconds for the last year, gives a bound and begins to beat high and irregularly in his breast. It seems as if he had never heard or felt or seen until that moment; and by the report of his memory, he must have lived his past life between sleep and waking, or with the pre-occupied attention of a brown study. He is practically incommoded by the generosity of his feelings, smiles much when he is alone, and develops a habit of looking rather blankly upon the moon and stars. But {{it is not at all}} within the province of a prose essayist to give a picture of this hyperbolical frame of mind; and the thing has been done already, and that to admiration. In [...] "Adelaïde," [...] in Tennyson's [...] "Maud," [...] and in some of Heine's songs, you get the absolute expression of this midsummer spirit. Romeo and Juliet were very much in love; although they tell me some German critics are of a different opinion, probably the same who would have us think Mercutio a dull fellow. Poor Antony was in love, and no mistake. That lay figure, Marius, in [...] "Les Misérables," [...] is also a genuine case in his own way, and worth observation. A good many of George Sand's people are thoroughly in love; and so are a good many of George Meredith's. Altogether, there is plenty to read on the subject. If the root of the matter be in him, and if he has the requisite chords to set in vibration, a young man may occasionally enter, with the key of art, into that land of Beulah which is upon the borders of Heaven, and within sight of <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>Love.</b> There let him sit awhile to hatch delightful hopes and perilous illusions.|$|E

50|$|Paris {{occupies}} the same niche {{as one of}} the most respected fashion centers in general and street style, in particular. Just as Milan in Italy, Paris’ look can be considered through frameworks of fashion fads, designers, a chic and luxury capital, artists and a bohemian lifestyle. Secondly, Paris is a perfect example of creating the ‘city look’, a collective image - certain fashion garments, specifics and lifestyles embody definite urbanity in a city’s context. For instance, an image of ‘La Parisienne’, - the typical Parisian woman - does consist not only of clothing but also of certain manners, values and behavioural patterns associated with the country and its citizens. One of the most typical associations with Paris is that it is <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>love</b> and fashion, a romantic city full of chic and luxury. The fashion phenomenon can provide strong associations and a clear understanding of Paris as a centre of fashion, love and dreams.|$|E
