5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} <b>taster,</b> Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E

5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a <b>taster</b> and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his <b>taster,</b> Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} <b>taster,</b> {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
40|$|Taste {{perception}} {{is controlled by}} taste cells that {{are present in the}} tongue and produce and secrete various metabolic hormones. Recent studies have demonstrated that taste receptors in tongue, gut and the pancreas are associated with local hormone secretion. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether there is a link between taste sensitivity and levels of circulating metabolic hormones in human and whether taste sensitivity is potentially related to peripheral metabolic regulation. 31 subjects were recruited and separated into <b>tasters</b> and non-tasters based on their phenol thiocarbamide (PTC) bitter taste test results. Fasting plasma and saliva were collected and levels of hormones and cytokines were assayed. We observed significant differences in both hormone levels and hormone-body mass index (BMI) correlation between <b>tasters</b> and non-tasters. <b>Tasters</b> had higher plasma levels of leptin (p= 0. 05), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p= 0. 04), and Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) (p= 0. 03). There was also a trend towards increased IGF- 1 levels in the saliva of <b>tasters</b> (p= 0. 06). We found a positive correlation between plasma levels of glucose and BMI (R= 0. 4999, p= 0. 04) exclusively in non-tasters, not in <b>tasters.</b> In contrast, plasma C-peptide levels were found to be positively correlated to BMI (R= 0. 5563, p= 0. 03) in <b>tasters.</b> Saliva TNF-α levels were negatively correlated with BMI in <b>tasters</b> (R= - 0. 5908, p= 0. 03). Our findings demonstrate that there are differences in circulating levels of leptin, TNF-α and IGF- 1 between <b>tasters</b> and non-tasters. These findings indicate that in addition to regulate eating behaviours, taste perception could also affect energy metabolism by controlling hormone secretion. People with different taste sensitivity may respond differently to the nutrient stimulation. Further work investigating the link between taste perception and peripheral metabolic control could potentially lead to the development of novel therapies for obese control...|$|R

25|$|Detecting an aroma is {{only part}} of wine tasting. The next step is to {{describe}} or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of wine tasting appears. Different individuals have their own way of describing familiar scents and aromas based on their unique experiences. Furthermore, there are varying levels of sensitivity and recognition thresholds among humans of some aromatic compounds. This is why one <b>taster</b> may describe different aromas and flavors from another <b>taster</b> sampling the very same wine.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Processamento de Alimentos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThis {{work had}} the objetive of forming {{a panel of}} {{qualified}} <b>tasters</b> in order to detect and recognize existing differences between various types of coffees. It consisted of a selection phase (Phase I) and a training phase (Phase II), after the recruitment of the interested people. On Phase I three sensory tests were carried out for solutions with basic tastes: Simple Identification Test, Combined Tastes Test and Triangular Test. A minimum score of acceptance was established for the candidates to be accepted to the following phase. On Phase II two sensory tests on coffee were carried out: Identification of Tastes and Triangular Test. A minimum score (67 %) was determined for the <b>tasters</b> to be accepted in the panel of qualified <b>tasters.</b> Given the results of Phase I, out of the twenty candidates, three were eliminated, five had the maximum score and two were within the acceptance threshold.

25|$|Coates Law of Maturity is a {{principle}} used in wine tasting {{relating to the}} aging ability of wine. Developed by the British Master of Wine, Clive Coates, the principle states that a wine will remain at its peak (or optimal) drinking quality for a duration of time that {{is equal to the}} time of maturation required to reach its optimal quality. During the evolution (aging) of a wine certain flavors, aromas and textures appear and fade. Rather than developing and fading in unison, these traits each operate on a unique evolutionary path and time line. The principle allows for the subjectivity of individual tastes because it follows the logic that positive traits that appeal to one particular wine <b>taster</b> will continue to persist along the principle's guideline while for another <b>taster</b> these traits might not be positive and therefore not applicable to the guideline. Wine expert Tom Stevenson has noted that there is logic in Coates' principle and that he has yet to encounter an anomaly or wine that debunks it.|$|E

25|$|To ensure {{impartial}} {{judgment of}} a wine, {{it should be}} served blind – that is, without the <b>taster(s)</b> having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask {{the color of the}} wine. A <b>taster's</b> judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.|$|R
25|$|Without having {{tasted the}} wines, {{one does not}} know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the <b>taster</b> tries to {{determine}} {{the order in which}} the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in color and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, viscous streaks (called legs or tears) down the inside of the glass when swirled.|$|E
25|$|Sweetness is subjectively {{measured}} {{by comparing the}} threshold values, or level at which {{the presence of a}} dilute substance can be detected by a human <b>taster,</b> of different sweet substances. Substances are usually measured relative to sucrose, which is usually given an arbitrary index of 1 or 100. Fructose is about 1.4 times sweeter than sucrose; glucose, a sugar found in honey and vegetables, is about three-quarters as sweet; and lactose, a milk sugar, is one-half as sweet.|$|E
25|$|This {{blending}} may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended {{to achieve}} the desired volume.
