25|$|Finally, however, {{there came}} a point in July 1461 when the king's {{physicians}} concluded that Charles would not live past August. Ill and weary, the king became delirious, convinced that {{he was surrounded by}} traitors loyal only to his son. Under the pressure of sickness and fever, he went mad. By now another infection in his jaw had caused a tumor or abscess in his mouth. The swelling caused by this became so large <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> week of his life, Charles was unable to swallow food or water. Although he asked the Dauphin to come to his deathbed, Louis refused, instead waiting at Avesnes, in Burgundy, for his father to die. At Mehun-sur-Yèvre, attended by his younger son, Charles, and aware of his elder son's final betrayal, the King starved to death. He died on 22 July 1461, and was buried, at his request, beside his parents in Saint-Denis.|$|E

Megawati did not respond when she received the letter, although she invited Yudhoyono along to a cabinet meeting on 11 March 2004.

[...] The same year, SNK released The King of Fighters '94 in arcades, where players choose from teams of three characters to eliminate each other one by one. Eventually, Capcom released further updates to Street Fighter II, including Super Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo. These games featured more characters and new moves, {{some of which were}} a response to people who had hacked the original Street Fighter II game to add new features themselves. However, criticism of these updates grew as players demanded a true sequel. By 1995, the dominant franchises were the Mortal Kombat series in America and Virtua Fighter series in Japan, with Street Fighter Alpha unable to match the popularity of Street Fighter II. Throughout this period, the fighting game was the dominant genre in competitive video gaming, with enthusiasts popularly attending arcades in order to find human opponents.

40|$|In {{the paper}} Fabricating Heritage David Lowenthal distinguishes between history and heritage, {{and says that}} history seeks to {{convince}} by truth, and succumbs to falsehood, while heritage exaggerates and omits, candidly invents and frankly forgets, and thrives on ignorance and error. As Lowenthal states, heritage uses historical traces and tells historical tales, but these tales and traces are stitched into fables closed to critical scrutiny, {{because it is not}} erudition but catechism - not checkable fact but credulous allegiance. Hence the Lowenthal's conclusion: Heritage is not a testable or even plausible version of our past; it is a declaration of faith in that past. Starting from these positions, this paper will examine the relationship between the scientific approach to the problem of heritage and heritage processes independent of institutionalized protection system ('heritage catechism'). What we want to preserve is a specific quality, the quality of testimonial nature. It is the quality of the aforesaid forms and contents that have overcome past in order to testify, hence to fully inform us of the reality from which they originated and while testifying about that reality, they synchronously testify about those who care about them nowadays. Although seemingly paradoxical, like a lightning rod in the church, this paper defends <b>the</b> thesis <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasting</b> care <b>for</b> heritage, and thus for a comprehensive understanding of the meaning of the past, synergy of scientific and 'catechistic' approach to heritage is necessary...|$|R
