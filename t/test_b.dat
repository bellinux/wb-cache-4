50|$|In some {{versions}} of the Schilling <b>test,</b> <b>B</b> can be given both with and without intrinsic factor at the same time, using different cobalt radioisotopes 57Co and 58Co, which have different radiation signatures, in order to differentiate the two forms of B. This is performed with the 'Dicopac' kitset. This allows for only a single radioactive urine collection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Test</b> <b>B</b> (Test Baker) was {{performed}} on July 24th 1946. The YO-160 sank immediately after the blast primarily due to the hole that was punched into it before the test. The sinking was documented by tower camera pictures. The only significant damage recorded based on the pictures was that the barge was fractured by the blast near the previous damage and the fracturing caused the barge to sink.|$|E

The test caused cracking and derangement of interior furnishing within the ARDC-13 at eight-hundred and forty yards away from the blast. However, the dock retained its structural shape. There was charring of the port side fenders and the outboard face of the port wall was lightly charred as well. All walkways and other timber on the dock was heavily charred or destroyed. The dock was cleared radio-logically on July 4th 1946 and repaired to prepare for <b>test</b> <b>B.</b> The dock was re-positioned on July 13th 1946 using four twenty-four thousand pound anchors and readied for Test Baker.|$|E

The venom is supposedly slightly less toxic than those of B. arietans and B. gabonica. The maximum wet venom yield is 200 mg. One study reported this venom has the highest intramuscular LD50 value—8.6 mg/kg—of five different viperid venoms <b>tested</b> (<b>B.</b> arietans, B. gabonica, B. nasicornis, Daboia russelii and Vipera aspis).

30|$|When {{the boards}} were used under mild {{conditions}} such as high humidity and cyclic humidity, their MOR and IB did not reduce, except for the PF board and aspen board. Long-time outdoor exposure (3 and 5  years) caused large reduction in the MOR and IB of the PF board, MDI board, aspen board, and pine board, showing that outdoor exposure was more detrimental for these boards than high humidity and cyclic humidity. The F-MDI board retained high MOR and IB for 5 -year outdoor exposure and JIS <b>Test</b> <b>B.</b> Although the IB of the F-MUF board reduced after the JIS <b>Test</b> <b>B,</b> the IB retention was as high as 87.8  % for 5 -year outdoor exposure.|$|E

40|$|During {{the design}} and {{development}} of truck cabins, {{the safety of the}} driver and the front seat passenger in an accident is an important task and should be considered. The cab must be designed {{in such a way that}} in an accident a sufficient survival space is guaranteed. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of Iran Khodro (IKCO) 2624 truck subjected to a complex crash test according to regulation ECE-R 29. This regulation is a comprehensive European regulation consisting of three tests: 1 -Front impact test (Test A), 2 -Roof strength test (<b>Test</b> <b>B),</b> 3 -Rear wall strength test (Test C). These tests do not consider the safety of the occupant directly; however, a III- 50 th % dummy was used to assess the cab’s deformations relative to the driver survival space. A 3 D finite element model of the cab and chassis was developed and subjected to tests by using LS-DYNA software. The results indicate that the cab complied with Test A and C successfully while it passed <b>Test</b> <b>B</b> marginally. Finally, two solutions are suggested and implemented to improve the cab’s response for <b>Test</b> <b>B...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} balanced incomplete block designs in quality improvement research, and their capacity to control for the Hawthorne effect. Methods: General practitioners teams were randomized into three arms and received an intervention on test ordering, relating to tests for two groups of clinical problems (A <b>tests</b> and <b>B</b> <b>tests).</b> In the two trials within the block design, we tried to control for the Hawthorne effect by comparing the complete intervention in both arms on either the A (arm I) or <b>B</b> <b>tests</b> (arm II); the arms acted as blind controls for each other. In the classical trial, the complete intervention on <b>B</b> <b>tests</b> (arm II) was compared with a control arm without any intervention on <b>B</b> <b>tests</b> (arm III). Results: The trials with the block design yielded statistically {{significant changes in the}} numbers of A tests ordered (P =. 013), but not in the numbers of <b>B</b> <b>tests</b> ordered (P =. 29). In the classical design, the complete intervention reached a marginally significant change in the <b>B</b> <b>tests</b> (P =. 068). The Hawthorne effect was the same for both arms of the block design. In the classical design, the effect could to some extent be attributed to the Hawthorne effect. Conclusion: Our block design allowed us to control for the Hawthorne effect. Suitable use of block designs may further our knowledge of nonspecific effects in quality improvement research.
