40|$|International audienceThe South Middle Atlas front {{constitutes}} a northeast-trending shear zone, located {{north of the}} Neogene Missour basin adn east of the Taza Guercif basin. This paper analyses the Southern Middle Atlas Fault Zone (SMAFZ) deformation since the Pliocene. The set of structures observed suggests that reverse and thrust faulting along {{the central part of}} the SMARZ are combined with left-lateral slip along N-S striking faults of its south-western termination and right-lateral faulting along E-NE striking faults of the east-northeast <b>termination.</b> <b>Thrust</b> and oblique trust-related anticlines of the two lateral ramps partly accommodate north-west directed motion of the Afican plate. The Thrusts probably resulted from rejuvenation of Jurassic normal fault; they were active durin the Upper Miocene-Pliocene and the Pleistocene. The géometries of positive inversion structures and buttressing effects are clearly dependent on the geometry and sedimentology of the original basin-controlling fault system and on the presence of a décollement level. Field mapping is integrated with Landsat imagery and a digital elevation model to investigate the morphotectonic evolution of the south-eastern range front of the Middle Atlas. Geomorphological features provide significant information on the processes that govern lateral propagation of active anticlines. Both suggest the deformation front may have been active since Pliocene...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe NW {{trending}} Zagros fold-and-thrust belt {{is affected}} by two major dextral faults: (1) the NW trending Main Recent Fault that accommodates partitioning of oblique convergence {{at the rear of}} the western Zagros and (2) the north trending Kazerun Fault located in the central Zagros. Combined structural and fault kinematics studies and SPOT images analysis have shown a Pliocene kinematic change accompanied by a fault pattern reorganization, which has led to a modification in the accommodation of oblique convergence. Since the late Pliocene, the distributed transpressional deformation operating {{at the rear of the}} belt has become partitioned along the newly formed Main Recent Fault. This fault cuts through early Pliocene nappes and transpressional structures by right-laterally reactivating high-angle <b>thrusts.</b> The southeastern <b>termination</b> of the Main Recent Fault connects to the northern termination of Kazerun Fault that consists of three fault zones that end in bent, orogen-parallel splay thrust faults. The Kazerun Fault, together with a series of north to NNW trending inherited basement strike-slip faults, define an orogen-scale fan-shaped fault pattern pointing toward the Main Recent Fault-Kazerun Fault junction. This structural pattern allows slip from along the Main Recent Fault to become distributed by transfer to the longitudinal thrust faults and folds of the Zagros belt, with the fan-shaped fault pattern acting as a horse-tail termination of the Main Recent Fault...|$|R
40|$|The Mesoproterozoic Bushmanland Subprovince {{of northwestern}} South Africa forms the western {{continuation}} of the transcontinental Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province, a crustal domain affected by the 1020 - 1220 Ma Namaquan Orogeny. Cross-cut by several large faults, the Bushmanland Subprovince can be subdivided into a southern Garies Terrain and northern Aggeneys Terrain. The supracrustal rocks of the Aggeneys Terrain (i. e. Bushmanland Group), comprise a thin (250 °C), metalliferous hydrothermal fluids infiltrated and altered these hydrogenous Fe-Mnrich metasedimentary rocks, resulting in the deposition of base-metal sulfides, formation of magnetite-amphibolite-rich Fe-Mn-rich rocks, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the siliciclastic wall rocks to form coticules. The spatial restriction of epigenetic Fe-Mn-rich rocks to shear zones, high Fe 2 O 3 T (ca. 65 wt %), low ΣREE (ca. 13 ppm), presence of recrystallized quartz crystals, elevated concentration of Cu in some occurrences and general similarities with some hydrothermal iron/iron-oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits, suggests that the epigenetic Fe-Mn-rich rocks may have formed during prograde metamorphism. Low concentrations of SrO (0. 5 ± 0. 2 wt %), highly radiogenic Sr/ Sr ratios (0. 7164 ± 0. 0028), elevated δ S (27. 3 ± 4. 9 ‰) and δ O (7. 7 ± 3. 1 ‰) values in the barites, as compared to contemporaneous Mesoproterozoic seawater, suggests precipitation of stratiform and stratabound barite layers in the Bushmanland Group occurred through mixing of an evolved continental crustal source and contemporaneous seawater sulfate, 87 86 34 18 modified by bacterial sulfate reduction. Most importantly, δ O values suggest possible minimum temperatures of formation ranging from 18 250 °C for occurrences in the Aggeneys area. These obvious differences in temperature of formation are in good agreement with the Cu-rich, Ba-poor nature of the sulfide mineralization characteristic of the Aggeneys deposits versus the Cu-poor, Ba-rich character of the Gamsberg deposit. In conjunction with this, the isotopic and petrographic arguments favor a sub-seafloor replacement model for the stratabound barite occurrences of the Aggeneys deposits, while at Gamsberg, deposition at the sediment-water interface as a true sedimentary exhalite appears more acceptable. Data obtained in the present study, combined {{with the results of}} previous investigations can be used to develop a comprehensive model for the geological evolution of the Aggeneys Terrain and Namaqua Metamorphic Province. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Aggeneys Terrain and Namaqua Metamorphic Province is marked by two important tectonic events separated by an episode of tectonic quiescence. Extrusion and deposition of the metavolcano-sedimentary rocks of the Orange River Group at 1908 Ma marks the start of the Orange River Orogeny. vii Prior to emplacement of the Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite, the Orange River Group appears to have undergone a period of folding and low-grade metamorphism [D 1 /M 1] that was subsequently followed by emplacement of the Main Phase Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite roughly dated at 1890 Ma. Rapidly following emplacement of these intrusions, the lower crustal rocks of the Richtersveld Subprovince underwent a second, higher, amphibolite-facies metamorphic event [M 1 B] from 1870 - 1840 Ma. This event may have resulted in lower crustal melting and emplacement of the Gladkop Suite into an unknown package of metasediments or metasedimentary rocks south of the present day Orange River at roughly 1820 Ma. The Gladkop Suite was subsequently subjected to high-grade metamorphism at 1800 Ma. The Orange River Orogeny was terminated by emplacement of the Late Phase Vioolsdrift Intrusive Suite at approximately 1765 Ma and later northward-directed <b>thrusting.</b> Following <b>termination</b> of the Orange River Orogeny, deposition of the Bushmanland Group began in a tectonically stable environment marked by punctuated periods of tectonic activity that lasted until emplacement of the Little Namaqualand Suite at 1190 Ma. The detrital zircon populations of the Pella Quartzite Fm. and Koeris Fm. support (a) regional correlation of these stratigraphic units throughout the study area, (b) confirms sediment derivation from various local source terrains and (c) suggests a maximum depositional age of 1650 Ma. Furthermore, new age constraints reveal initiation of the O’okiepian Episode (Namaquan Orogeny), characterized by regional-scale mid- to high-grade contact metamorphism, was synchronous with emplacement of the Little Namaqualand Suite and deposition of the upper Kouboom Subgroup. Furthermore, the detrital zircon populations for the Driekop Fm. (upper Kouboom Subgroup) contain a large population of 1190 Ma (i. e. O’okiepian-age) detrital cores, suggesting a renewed period of tectonic uplift. Analogously, age constraints for the Koeris Fm. indicate a maximum depositional age of 1130 Ma, as well as derivation from a number of local and exotic source terrains indicating that deposition of the Koeris Fm. must have occurred in response to continental collision between the Rehoboth Inlier-Kaapvaal Craton and the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. Furthermore, these new age constraints also constrain the timing of D 2 -D 3 deformation to between 1130 - 1080 Ma and regional peak metamorphism to 1020 - 1040 Ma. Prof. N. J. Beukes Prof. J.

50|$|Unacceptable wind {{conditions}} had forced a 24-hour postponement of the launch, but the vehicle was successfully launched on May 13, 1964, at 12:59:59.7 UTC (05:59 am MST). A ground commanded abort signal terminated {{thrust of the}} launch vehicle (by rupturing the Algol motor casing), ignited the launch escape and pitch control motors, and separated the command module from the service module.

50|$|Approximately 325 seconds into flight, a {{malfunction}} {{was detected}} in the RD-0110 engine powering the Blok I third stage of the Soyuz-U rocket, which caused the onboard computer to terminate the flight through <b>thrust</b> <b>termination.</b> As a result, the vehicle failed to achieve orbit, reentering over the Altai Republic region of Russia. It was the first failure of a Progress spacecraft since launches began in 1978, and the third consecutive orbital launch failure worldwide, following the failures of Ekspress-AM4 and Shijian XI-04 {{less than a week}} prior. On 9 September, the FKA announced that the loss was caused by a blocked fuel duct, which caused the engines to shut down prematurely. The failure was not expected to have any immediate effect on the crew of the International Space Station, as the outpost was stocked with reserves of food, water and oxygen. The spacecraft was insured for three billion rubles (US$103 million). As a precaution, the launch of a GLONASS satellite on a Soyuz-2-1b/Fregat, which had been scheduled for 26 August, was delayed until the engines could be inspected.|$|E
5000|$|Ball disk integrators {{were used}} in the analog {{guidance}} computers of ballistic missile weapon systems as late as the mid 1970’s. The Pershing 1 missile system, utilized the Bendix ST-120 inertial guidance platform, combined with a mechanical analog computer, to achieve accurate guidance. The ST-120 provided accelerometer information for all three axes. The accelerometer for forward movement transmitted its position to the ball position radial arm, causing the ball fixture {{to move away from the}} disk center as acceleration increased. The disk itself represents time and rotates at a constant rate. As the ball fixture moves further out from the center of the disk, the ball spins faster. The ball speed represents the missile speed, the number of ball rotations represent distance traveled. These mechanical positions were used to determine staging events, <b>thrust</b> <b>termination,</b> and warhead separation, as well as [...] "good guidance" [...] signals used to complete the arming chain for the warhead. The first known use of this general concept was in the V-2 missile developed by the Von Braun group at Peenemunde. See PIGA Accelerometer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a {{multidisciplinary}} design optimization (MDO) approach {{of a solid}} propellant kick rocket motor is considered. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been used. The optimized kick solid rocket motor (KSRM) is capable of delivering a small satellite of 200 kg to a circular low earth orbit (LEO) of 600 km altitude. The KSRM should accelerate from the initial apogee velocity of 5000 m/s up to the orbital insertion velocity of 7560 m/s. The KSRM design variables and the orbital insertion trajectory profile variables were optimized simultaneously, whereas the mass characteristics of the payload deployment module were assigned. A depleted shutdown condition was considered, to avoid {{the necessity of a}} <b>thrust</b> <b>termination</b> device, resulting in a reduced total mass of the KSRM.
