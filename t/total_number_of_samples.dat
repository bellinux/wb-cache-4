Due to the Geographical difficulty and inaccessibility to this district, containing Cholera outbreak is becoming difficult. The lack of planning for the outbreak investigation, coordination at regional and district level, lack of management knowledge are the main factors for spreading outbreak from government side, whereas lack of awareness, open field defecation, eating stale food and drinking unsafe water are leading factors from the public part.A team from Nepal Health Research council (Dr. Gajananda Prakash Bhandari, Epidemiologist; Dr. Sameer Dixit, Biotechnologist) headed towards the affected Jajarkot and stayed there and visited interiors of the district, collected data and stool samples.

50|$|After {{the sample}} has been processed, the extract can be {{analysed}} {{using a variety}} of data analysis techniques. The chemical analysis and analytical instrumentation used depends on the goal of the study. Many analyses require multiple samples, although in some cases a single POCIS sample can be used for multiple analyses. It is vital to use quality control (QC) procedures when using passive samplers. It is common practice for 10% to 50% of the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> to be used for QC purposes. The number of QC samples depends on the study objectives. The QC samples are used to address issues such as sample contamination and analyte recovery.

30|$|Woody {{cover in}} the KNP {{has been shown to}} vary {{depending}} on topographic position, with the valleys having more woody cover (Gertenbach 1983). The topographic location <b>of</b> the field <b>sample</b> plots was, therefore, purposefully varied in order to represent woody cover in valley, crest and mid-slope positions. Therefore, purposive sampling was employed in the field, with the goal of representing these topographic positions in the sample data. The overall layout <b>of</b> the <b>sample</b> plots at each of the study sites approximated linear transects. Logistics and the time-consuming nature of the field work limited the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> plots and necessitated separate fieldwork excursions to the study sites during 2013 and 2014.

50|$|Because {{of these}} difficulties, {{researchers}} have developed some other approaches for identifying P. ramorum. The {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} test can {{be the first step}} in nonculture methods of identifying P. ramorum, but it can only be a first step, because it detects the presence of proteins that are produced by all Phytophthora species. In other words, it can identify to the genus level, but not to the species level. ELISA tests can process large numbers of samples at once, so researchers often use it to screen out likely positive samples from those that are not when the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> is very large. Some manufacturers produce small-scale ELISA “field kits” that the homeowner can use to determine if plant tissue is infected by Phytophthora.|$|E
5000|$|The geochemical {{properties}} of urban soils {{from more than}} 300 cities in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and America were evaluated. [...] In each settlement samples were collected uniformly throughout the territory, covering residential, industrial, recreational and other urban areas. The sampling was carried out directly from the soil surface and specifically traversed pits, ditches and wells from the upper soil horizon. The number of samples in each locality ranged from 30 to 1000. The published data and the materials kindly provided {{by a number of}} geochemists were also incorporated into the research. Considering the great importance of the defined contents, quantitative and quantitative emission spectral, gravimetric, X-ray fluorescence, and partly neutron activation analyses were carried out in parallel approximately in the samples. In a volume of 3-5% of the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> sampling and analyses of the inner and external controls were conducted. Calculation of random errors and systematic errors allowed to consider the sampling and analytical laboratory work as good.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collections}} of botany represent numerically the greatest {{heritage of the}} Muséum d'Angers, {{with more than half}} of the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> all field together. The herbaria contain more than [...] samples, mainly dating from the nineteenth century. They are organized around three important collections : the general herbarium, that of Alexandre Boreau and that of James Lloyd, the three herbaria making up about 80% of the total samples. The general herbarium contains several type-specimens, including types of the island of Reunion, {{collections of}} Commerson (journey of Bougainville), La Billardière (expedition of Entrecasteaux), Poiteau (Santo Domingo) and even some rare samples from the seventeenth century). The Boreau herbarium contains probably more than [...] samples, material used for the writing of the flora of the center of France, the most famous regional flora of its time. The Lloyd herbarium (100,000 collections) contains [...] species, the basis of the flora of western France; it is accompanied by an imposing library. There are also herbaria of mosses (Bouvet, Bruneau), lichens (Decuillé, Thuillier), mushrooms (Gaillard, Guépin, Rabenhorst) and algae (Lloyd, Bory, Corillion). Specialized botany is preserved in Angers, where one of the most important bathology collections (herbaria of the genus Rubus) in Europe is housed. A seed library is made up of, on the one hand, pedagogical samples (about [...] French and 200 tropical species) and, on the other hand, a Vilmorin collection of early 20th century tree seeds, with additions from the National Museum and Roland Bonaparte (approximately 1,100 samples). The xylotheque, also made up of two parts, gwthers harvested trees from the Jardin des Plantes d'Angers and the Gaston-Allard Arboretum, as well as a collection of 69 samples of French Guyanese precious woods collected in 1802.|$|E
