Somatogravic illusion, in aviation, {{is a type of}} optical illusion which can cause the crew to think that they are pitching up, while in reality, they are not. This could happen during night-time flying (causing the crew to lose their visual reference, as it was dark) accompanied by the lack of monitoring of the flight's indicator. Somatogravic illusion was responsible for the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072 in Bahrain. However, the BEA also suspected the specific features of the speed indication on the PFD, especially speed limitations for the Airbus A320 configuration that are shown as the red bars {{at the top of the}} speed indication strip. One of the crew members might have adopted the reflex acquired in training, for example, in response to a <b>TCAS</b> <b>warning</b> when the pilot is anxious to avoid the displayed red part of the instrument scale, which may result in the instinctive forward movement of the side stick, especially when the pilot is in a state of psycho-emotional strain. This version is substantiated by the fact that the pilot was monitoring the flight speed and its limitations (VFE) that depended on the Airbus A320 configuration and retracted the flaps and slats in a timely manner, and the control inputs on the side stick coincided with the moments when the current speed was getting close to the limit value. However, neither of these probable causes have enough evidence.|$|E
30|$|This type of {{emergence}} describes emergence with top-down feedback, {{which is}} predictable in principle, {{but not in}} every detail. The roles of the elements and agents are flexible. Coherent global structures appear and become visible on {{a higher level of}} organization through the local interaction of several autonomous agents. The top-down feedback from the group imposes constraints on the local interactions. Examples from air transportation include a sequence of flying aircraft, which limits the possible speed adjustments of individual aircraft. The agents (e.g. flight crew) adjust their behavior and their role in the group according to the actual context and situation (e.g. following an ATC instruction, or <b>TCAS</b> <b>warning).</b> Feedback from the environment or group to the agent is possible through this form of context dependency.|$|E
