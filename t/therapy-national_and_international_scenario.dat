40|$|ABSTRACT Widely disseminated in both {{national}} <b>and</b> <b>international</b> <b>scenarios,</b> greenhouses are agribusiness solutions which {{are designed to}} allow for greater efficiency {{and control of the}} cultivation of plants. Bearing this in mind, the construction of greenhouses should take into consideration the incidence of wind, and other such aspects of comfort and safety, and ensure they are factored into the design of structural elements. In this study, we evaluated the effects of pressure coefficients established by the European standard EN 13031 - 1 (2001) and the Brazilian standard ABNT (1988), which are applicable to the structures of greenhouses with flat roofs, taking into account the following variables: roof slope, external and internal pressure coefficients and height-span ratio of the structure. Using the ANSYSTM computer program, zones of columns and roof were discretized by the Beam 44 finite element to identify the maximum and minimum stress portions connected to the aerodynamic coefficients. With this analysis, we found that, in the smallest roof slope (a equal to 20 °), the frame stress was quite similar for standards adopted. On the other hand, for the greatest inclination (a equal to 26 °), the stress was consistently lower under the Brazilian standard. In view of this, we {{came to the conclusion that}} the differences between stresses when applying both standards were more significant at the higher degrees of height-span ratio and roof slope...|$|R

However, among the papers that described some kind of evaluation, only around 20 % performed more rigorous evaluations (i. e. case studies, quasi experiments, or controlled experiments). Such percentage is low when compared to ICSE, which presented 40 % of papers with more rigorous evaluations within the same period. Nevertheless, we noticed that both venues still lack the publication of research reporting controlled experiments: only a single paper in each conference presented this type of evaluation.

There are many scenario sets {{that have been developed}} at the global and regional level, but to a lesser extent at the national and local levels. Yet fewer studies have explicitly linked imagined futures at different social–ecological scales.

These futures were then analysed against published regional (Amazonian) <b>and</b> <b>international</b> <b>scenarios</b> using a qualitative coding approach and supported by quantitative factorial analysis. This allowed us to develop a matrix of multi-scalar scenarios, showing how scenarios at all scales interact. From this, we were able to identify virtuous and vicious cycles amongst the different scales where developments produced feedbacks to make situations worse, better or counteract change at other levels. Our results show that there is considerable mismatch between the different scales of analysis, with the national scale playing a key role as mediator.

5000|$|When {{reviewing}} Huracán, Márquez {{notes that}} the book was published and received awards in Ponce, then {{the epicenter of the}} autonomist and independentist movements. The novel was also published in a time when the conflicts that eventually led to the Hispano-American War were at its height, and the author believes that its narrative was directed towards those that saw an ally in the United States, noting that in essence they were after the same imperial goals as Spain. Márquez states that the pirate's motives are portrayed in two different fronts, the local <b>and</b> <b>international</b> <b>scenarios,</b> with a hint of mystification labeling him as the first Puerto Rican rebel. Like Reid, the author soon notices the contrast between this etic representation of the pirate and the cutthroat stereotypes of contemporary literature. Ultimately, this version of Cofresí portrays a [...] "champion of the Puerto Rican cause" [...] that faces off against the Imperial powers of the era, with the virtue of valor being represented as fundamental beyond social classes, a symbol of Del Toro's desire to promote a collective alliance. As was the case with Tapia's Cofresí, here the death of the pirate serves to create this multisectorial union. Márquez concludes that both authors used their books to argue for a solution to Puerto Rico's status as a colony of Spain, but that Tapia's work inclined towards negotiating while Del Toro emphasized the need for resistance.|$|R

To accomplish that, construction industries are characterised by having mobile assets and even mobile work force relative to many other industries' activities. In many situations, organising construction industry activities may be based on sound judgement and common sense. This implies imprecise and vague decisions.

40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract This paper {{addresses}} the social effects of macroeconomic volatility in Brazil, {{as well as}} the burdens and challenges it has been imposing on social policies. Volatility is analyzed both in terms of its internal causes and those related to the world economy, as well as in its social effects and on policies aimed at counterbalancing them. The period covered by the analysis extends from 1995 to 2002, and coincides with President Cardoso's two terms. It is marked by increasing economic volatility, as he moved from the first to the second term. To understand this increased volatility the paper looks at its origins and at the macroeconomic policies adopted to counteract it. Volatility is also examined {{in the context of a}} new national <b>and</b> <b>international</b> <b>scenario</b> in which three main processes can be identified: economic and financial globalization, the privatization of state companies and foreign trade liberalization. The analysis shows that Cardoso's government made major advances in terms of price stability. It has failed, however, in its attempt to lead the country towards sustained growth, as it relied on misguided macroeconomic policies, particularly its exchange and fiscal policies during the first term which increased the economy's external and domestic vulnerability. After analyzing macroeconomic volatility, the paper moves to its primary focus, the social effects of economic problems and policies, and what has been done to mitigate them. Following this approach, it examines the performance of social indicators of the period. In this respect, the analysis reveals that the government accomplished major advances in education, health and income transfers to the poorest groups, following a sharp increase of the tax burden, which it was able to introduce even in conditions of sluggish growth, in a counter cyclical fashion. In a new <b>international</b> <b>scenario</b> that has overemphasized the role of markets in solving economic and social problems, it was not a surprise that Brazil had to rely on income transfers in order to alleviate the plight of the poorest groups. Poverty conditions found in the country are so severe that it would be naïve to expect that they could be significantly reduced by the interplay of market forces, even in the medium term. The paper also {{addresses the}} perspectives for the next government. In the short run, the serious economic scenario inherited by President Lula makes it difficult to implement new and major advances in expanding social expenditures, as the tax burden is coming close to a saturation point and faces increasing opposition. Thus, the situation is such that it requires a renewed attention to the quality of macroeconomic management, in order to improve growth rates and open room for sustainable social policies based on increased tax revenues coming from an expanded tax basis. Given this picture, a thin path has been identified to lead the country in this direction and out the current difficulties, which have recently become less dramatic because of the adjustment presented by the foreign sector accounts, and by the stand adopted by the elected president in announcing policies that have dissipated most fears of their mismanagement. This path involves continuing fiscal discipline by maintaining and even enlarging the primary fiscal surplus, with an eye to bargaining this movement for the market's willingness to accept lower interest rates on the public debt. In the foreign front, an emphasis on export promotion and a new round of import substitution, this time coming with enhanced competitiveness on the part of local producers. In essence, what is sought is to reduce vulnerability and volatility, both from domestic and external sources. Looking at the medium and long term, and taking into account a new national <b>and</b> <b>international</b> <b>scenario</b> created by economic and financial globalization, privatization and trade liberalization, other lessons from the Cardoso period are clear. In particular, they point to less dependence on external finance, more caution with globalization in general, a different course for privatization -including constraints on the use of its resources by the government, a screening of the pricing policies of the privatized sectors and a move towards public offers that democratize ownership of capital property- and an external trade and financial policy explicitly guided by national interests, with selective attention to some Trojan horses offered by globalization -as was the initially easy access to financial globalization- all this consistently sustained by other policies, in particular a realistic exchange rate...|$|R
