5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> organisms {{detect and}} {{interact}} with each other and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} enzyme {{kinetics}} {{is important for}} two basic reasons. Firstly, it helps explain how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, KM and Vmax, are critical to attempts <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> enzymes work together to control metabolism.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt sought <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> the English {{political system}} had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with {{the concerns of the}} chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|International Baccalaureate (IB) is a rigorous, internationally {{accepted}} {{academic program}} required of all 21st century Baltimore City College students. The IB Middle Years Program {{is intended to}} teach freshman and sophomore students <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> core subjects are interrelated, how to master critical thinking processes, and to increase intercultural awareness. As juniors and seniors, students engage in the rigorous two-year IB Diploma curriculum that requires a comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the major}} {{distributed}} computing projects involved in protein research, Folding@home {{is the only one}} not using the BOINC platform. Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computing protein design and predicting protein structure and docking.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E
5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research {{has led to}} an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
