She had been a school teacher at St Andrew's School before the war. The couple helped the Changi prisoners-of-war (POW) by passing on cash and parcels containing such things as fresh clothing, medicine and letters during their deliveries. An informant told the Kempeitai that the Choys were involved in smuggling money into Changi Prison, and Khun Heng was arrested. After several days, Elizabeth went to <b>the</b> <b>YMCA</b> on Stamford Road, used by the Kempeitai as their headquarters, known as the Kempeitai East District Branch, to inquire about her husband. The Japanese denied all knowledge of him, but three weeks later they lured her back to <b>the</b> <b>YMCA</b> and confined her with other Chinese and Changi prisoners.

5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in <b>the</b> <b>YMCA</b> for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people {{she said she had}} helped.

People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E
