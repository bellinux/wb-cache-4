40|$|Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) is a {{low-cost}} {{process for the}} production of composite parts with thermosetting resins. However, the economic convenience is lost in the case of large components, such as aeronautical panels, because of the high tooling cost. Step milling of a resin master for the electro-deposition of a nickel shell is proposed in this study as a valid alternative for the fabrication of a resin <b>transfer</b> <b>mould.</b> This solution allows overcoming the limitations regarding part size and cutting down tooling costs, but the expected dimensional accuracy needs to be assessed.

It was {{published}} in the journal Transactions of the Institute of Metal Finishing [Maney Publishing / © Institute of Metal Finishing] and is available at: [URL] of RTM moulds – the problem! The removal of loosely bound or weakly adsorbed contamination from surfaces can usually be achieved using conventional cleaning methods such as solvents or proprietory aqueous-based cleaning solutions. However, the removal of fully crosslinked material which might be strongly adsorbed or chemisorbed onto surfaces, such as paints or adhesives, presents a much greater challenge. Similarly, residual epoxide resins remaining on the inside surfaces of resin <b>transfer</b> <b>mould</b> (RTM) tooling post curing are strongly adhered to the mould surface and need to be removed so that the mould can be reused. The mould materials are typically steel or nickel but may be compositebased. Conventional methods cannot fully remove residual epoxide material without the use of hazardous chemicals and mechanical removal can easily result in damage to the underlying mould which may compromise its reuse. Therefore, a number of novel cleaning solutions have been investigated to address the challenging problem of how to remove fully crosslinked epoxide resins from RTM mould surfaces...|$|E

40|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{processes}} to perform microchip encapsulation for electronic packages. Existing analytical models, such as generalised Hele-Shaw model, seem to be inadequate to model the process accurately in real world environment due to the complex inter-relationships among the encapsulant properties, process conditions, mould design parameters and overall moulding performance and the inherent fuzziness of the moulding systems. It is quite often that the observed values from the <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> for microchip encapsulation may not be regular. Although statistical regression method could be used to perform the modelling, high degree of fuzziness inherent in <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> systems for microchip encapsulation makes the obtained models having wide possibility range. In this paper, the fuzzy regression concept and its application in modelling <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> for microchip encapsulation are described. Fuzzy regression is a well-known method to deal with the problems {{with a high degree of}} fuzziness. Thirty-two experiments were firstly conducted based on an 2 iv 8 - 2 experimental plan in this study that involved eight process parameters and three quality characteristics. The experimental settings and results of the 30 experiments were then used to develop three fuzzy linear regression models, which relate various process parameters and the three quality characteristics, respectively. With the use of these models, proper process conditions and prediction range of individual quality measures can be obtained. Two validation tests were carried out to evaluate the developed models. Results of the tests show that the actual values of all the quality measures were found within the corresponding prediction ranges.

40|$|Resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> is one {{of several}} {{processes}} available for manufacturing fibre-reinforced composites from dry fibre reinforcement. Recently, dry reinforcements made with Automated Dry Fibre Placement have been introduced into the aerospace industry. Typically, the permeability of the reinforcement is assumed to be constant throughout the dry preform geometry whereas in reality it possesses inevitable uncertainty due to variability in geometry. This uncertainty propagates to the uncertainty of the mould filling and the fill time, one of the important variables in resin injection. It makes characterisation of the permeability and its variability an important task for design of the resin <b>transfer</b> <b>moulding</b> process. In this study, variability of the geometry of a reinforcement manufactured using Automated Dry Fibre Placement is studied. Permeability of the manufactured preforms is measured experimentally and compared to stochastic simulations based on an analytical model and a stochastic geometry model.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of production monitoring on an aerospace composite component: the hinge arm of the droop nose mechanism on the Airbus A 380 wing leading edge. A sensor network composed of Fibre Bragg Gratings, capacitive sensors for cure monitoring and thermocouples was embedded in its fibre reinforced lay-up and measurements were acquired throughout its Resin <b>Transfer</b> <b>Moulding</b> production process. Two main challenges had to be overcome: first, the integration of the sensor lines in the existing Resin <b>Transfer</b> <b>Moulding</b> mould without modifying it; second, the demoulding of the component without damaging the sensor lines. The proposed embedding solution has proved successful. The wavelength shifts of the Fibre Bragg Gratings were observed from the initial production stages, over the resin injection, the complete curing of the resin and the cooling-down prior to demoulding. The sensors proved to be sensitive to detecting the resin flow front, vacuum and pressure increase into the mould and the temperature increase caused by the resin curing. Measurements were also acquired during the post-curing cycle. Residual strains during all steps of the process were derived from the sensors’ wavelength shift, showing values up to 0. 2 % in compression. Moreover, the capacitive sensors were able to follow-up the curing degree during the production process.
