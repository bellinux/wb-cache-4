40|$|The {{weakness}} of the <b>tying</b> <b>down</b> systems between the structural elements {{has been identified as}} the main cause of the failure of light roof structures due to uplifting pressure from the wind. These weaknesses have caused part of the roof structure being blown off during thunderstorms. This project report presents the results of a study carried out to evaluate the load carrying capacities of joints for zinc/asbestos sheeting to purlin, purlin to rafter and rafter to roof beam in the frame structure for light roof construction. The capacities of these joints were determined from laboratory tests on respective samples and also from previous related tests. Comparisons were made with the calculated pressures from the wind and hence the pulling out forces exerted on each type of joint on modeled buildings representing the low and high rise houses located areas similar to those which experienced failure. Details of the structural configuration and types of joints adopted were within the range found in actual construction. The result show that the number of <b>tying</b> <b>down</b> <b>points</b> between members within a specified area of roof and the depth of penetration of the nails at three points currently adopted are inadequate. They are only sufficient to sustain forces exerted by the wind speeds of up to wind speeds of up to 10 m/s and 50 m/s in low and high rises building respectively. It was also proposed that the pitches between purlin and also between rafters in the present construction be reduced in order to achieve more connection points...|$|R
60|$|By twelve o'clock {{they were}} abreast of a town; which was, {{they had no}} doubt, San Sebastian. They were now some four miles from the Spanish coast. They were {{travelling}} {{at about the same}} rate as that at which they had started, but the wind came off the high land, and sometimes in such strong puffs that they had to loosen the sheet. The fisherman had shown them how to shorten sail by <b>tying</b> <b>down</b> the reef <b>points</b> and shifting the tack and, in the afternoon, the squalls came so heavily that they thought it best to lower the sail and reef it. Towards nightfall the wind had risen so much that they made for the land, and when darkness came on threw out the little grapnel the boat carried, a hundred yards or so from the shore, at a point where no village was visible. Here they were sheltered from the wind and, spreading out the nets to form a bed, they laid themselves down {{in the bottom of the}} boat, pulling the sail partly over them.|$|R

40|$|Question: How {{does one}} <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> {{items that are}} put into the bed {{of a pickup truck}} without causing damage to the body of the truck and have the ring {{disappear}} as well as be flush with the body? Rationale: With the increase of pickup trucks on the road, {{there is a need to}} <b>tie</b> items <b>down</b> securely in the bed to keep the public safe while the vehicle is in motion, as well as when parked. In most pickup trucks there are post/pole holes built into the bed that allows the users to put in either <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> anchors or pole/post made from wood. The problem with the <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> anchors is that they either fold/slide to attach items to the truck, but they all sit on top of the body. This doesn’t allow the driver to place items on top of the trucks bed, give the driver the option to put the ring away, and have weight restrictions; thus requiring a device for these tasks. Over the past year a device has been proposed, designed, and built to do these tasks, as well as offer features that other <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> anchors do not have. The results have shown that this device is able to do the task it is required to do; thus allowing this device to compete with the current benchmarks out in the market...|$|R
