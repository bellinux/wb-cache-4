5|$|SpaceChem was ported to the iPad in October 2011, using touch {{controls}} {{instead of}} mouse and keyboard {{to manipulate the}} visual program. An Android port was released in July 2012. Both mobile platforms include most of the full game excluding the defense puzzles. <b>The</b> <b>sandbox</b> mode was added {{at the request of}} a player who was trying to explore SpaceChem computational abilities. Alongside <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> mode, Zactronics offered a contest for the most interesting sandbox creation. This same user was able to demonstrate a brainfuck interpreter within SpaceChem, claiming that the visual programming language was Turing complete. Barth has mentioned the possibility of a sequel in an interview with IndieGamer.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Live & Reloaded, Rare began work on another game in the Conker {{universe}} titled Conker: Gettin' Medieval. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled. Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> game Project Spark. The campaign, titled Conker's Big Reunion, is set {{ten years after the}} events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. Conker's Bad Fur Day is also included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about <b>the</b> <b>sandbox,</b> such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Class MB {{on which}} <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> {{were placed on}} top of the boiler in {{accordance}} with American practice, <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> of <b>the</b> Class MC were arranged on a different system, the advantages of which were questionable. <b>The</b> <b>sandboxes</b> for <b>the</b> hind engine unit were secured to the running board just {{to the rear of the}} high-pressure cylinders, while those for the front engine unit were placed on the upper sides of the boiler just to the rear of the smokebox.|$|R
25|$|As built, <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> were {{mounted on}} the front of the water tank and rear of the coal bunker, one on either side of each headlight. On some {{locomotives}} <b>the</b> front <b>sandboxes</b> were later relocated to the top of the tank.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{are nearly}} always fitted with sandboxes from which sand {{can be delivered}} to the rails to improve traction and braking in wet or icy weather. On American locomotives <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes,</b> or sand domes, are usually mounted {{on top of the}} boiler. In Britain, the limited loading gauge precludes this, so <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> are mounted just above, or just below, the running plate.|$|R
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E

25|$|On the {{multiplayer}} side, it {{was revealed}} {{that there would be a}} new map called Fathom and that there would be changes to Empire, a map playable in the beta. A new mode that would combine all of <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> (later revealed as Warzone at E3 2015) was hinted at, and {{it was revealed}} that the game would feature 20 maps at launch and that 15 downloadable maps would be added later for free.|$|E
25|$|The leaked data {{revealed}} a zero-day cross-platform Flash exploit (CVE number: CVE-2015-5119). The dump included a demo of this exploit by opening Calculator from a test webpage. Adobe patched the hole on July 8, 2015. Another vulnerability involving Adobe was {{revealed in the}} dumps, which took advantage of a buffer overflow attack on an Adobe Open Type Manager DLL included with Microsoft Windows. The DLL is run in kernel mode, so the attack could perform privilege escalation to bypass <b>the</b> <b>sandbox.</b>|$|E
25|$|JavaScript and the DOM {{provide the}} {{potential}} for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox {{in which they can}} only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site {{do not have access to}} information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or <b>the</b> <b>sandbox.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 2150 {{class were}} an {{evolution}} of the 2130 class. They differed by having a modular control system and <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> relocated from <b>the</b> nose to the bogies. All were transferred to QR National in 2004, which became Aurizon in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sandboxes,</b> {{which were}} {{mounted on the}} bogie frames, were {{ineffective}} and required much too complicated gearing {{due to the fact}} that the engine units pivoted. It was suggested that sandboxes mounted on top of the smokeboxes would require much simpler gearing.|$|R
50|$|The last sixteen Falcon-built {{locomotives}} {{were all}} delivered in 1897, numbered {{in the range}} from BR20 to BR35. All these Falcon-built F2 and F4 locomotives bore their engine numbers on <b>the</b> <b>sandboxes</b> on their running boards, in the form of individual brass letters and numbers.|$|R
25|$|A large {{selection}} of vehicles are present, {{most of which}} are usable by the player. Available ground vehicles range from pickup trucks to tanks, while naval vessels range from motorboats to light military hovercraft. A larger patrol boat is available in custom-made multiplayer maps using <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> editor. All vehicles, including Humvees, pickup trucks, even tanks, have a turbo mode that can be activated via the Shift key (by default). The aircraft selection is limited to the North Korean attack helicopter and a fictional American VTOL (each of which can transport six passengers and two crew). Crytek also included an amphibious APC, a wheeled version of the APC that can travel on water and land, although this vehicle was only available for those who pre-ordered the game.|$|E
25|$|Pac-Man {{has also}} {{influenced}} many other games, ranging from <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police {{in a similar}} manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level. Pac-Man also influenced the use of power-ups in later games such as Arkanoid, and the game's artificial intelligence inspired programmers who later worked for companies such as Bethesda.|$|E
25|$|The {{first game}} of the series Crackdown was {{developed}} by Realtime Worlds and released on February 20, 2007, and a sequel called Crackdown 2 was released on July 6, 2010, this time developed by Ruffian Games. Both games were developed and released exclusively for the Xbox 360. An upcoming third installment Crackdown 3 is currently in development by Reagent Games and is set to be released on 2018 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Although Crackdown was originally released with access codes for the Halo 3 multiplayer beta to boost its sales, the game itself has been met with positive critical reception and won several video game awards. Critics praised <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> style third-person shooter for allowing the ability to cause massive destruction in a non-linear gameplay, while also criticizing the series for lacking an actual story. The series has garnered positive reception and commercial success.|$|E
50|$|A second Double Fairlie {{from the}} same builders, also with Walschaerts valve gear, was landed at East London in 1878 and {{incorporated}} all these suggested improvements except the water capacity, which remained the same.

500|$|Square Enix {{wanted to}} be one of the first {{companies}} to make games for the WiiWare service to attract more attention to their game as it was very different from other Final Fantasy games. One of the developers of , Kenichiro Yuji, was chosen as the games director. Several gameplay ideas were considered for the project, including making it an action role-playing game or a sandbox video game, but the developers were not fans of <b>the</b> <b>sandbox</b> genre and settled on making an action role-playing game. The game originated from the concept that the player should control a king, rather than the hero, what they called an [...] "inverted game" [...] from the usual format. The battle system went through four revisions, much of which was discarded before the final design was agreed upon. At first it was thought that players would spend most of their time observing the action, but eventually features were added to encourage player engagement through various activities. Battle reports thus became one of the toughest challenges for the team, and went through several iterations to get right. The development team also found it difficult to write dialogue that would keep the game exciting without the player actually participating in or even witnessing the battles.|$|E
