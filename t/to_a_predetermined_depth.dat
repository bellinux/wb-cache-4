50|$|Surface {{contamination}} of wells in the United States is typically {{controlled by the}} use of a surface seal. A large hole is drilled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>predetermined</b> <b>depth</b> or to a confining formation (clay or bedrock, for example), and then a smaller hole for the well is completed from that point forward. The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next confining layer that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer. In addition, wells are typically capped with either an engineered well cap or seal that vents air through a screen into the well, but keeps insects, small animals, and unauthorized persons from accessing the well.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} {{based on the}} {{adaptation}} of the Pulse Transient Hot Strip technique to slab sample geometry has been developed for studying thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of anisotropic thin film materials (< 50 mu m) with thermal conductivity in the 0. 01 - 100 W/mK range, deposited on thin substrates (i. e., wafers). Strength of this technique is that it provides a well-controlled thermal probing depth, making it possible <b>to</b> probe <b>a</b> <b>predetermined</b> <b>depth</b> of the sample layer and thereby avoiding the influence from material(s) deeper down in the sample. To verify the technique a series of measurements were conducted on a y-cut single crystal quartz wafer. A Hot Strip sensor (32 -mu m wide, 3. 2 -mm long) was deposited along two orthogonal crystallographic (x- and z-) directions and two independent pulse transients were recorded. Thereafter, the data was fitted to our theoretical model, and the anisotropic thermal transport properties were determined. Using a thermal probing depth of only 30 mu m, we obtained a thermal conductivity along the perpendicular (parallel) direction to the z-, i. e., optic axis of 6. 48 (11. 4) W/mK, and a thermal diffusivity of 3. 62 (6. 52) mm(2) /s. This yields a volumetric specific heat of 1. 79 MJ/mK. These values agree well with tabulated data on bulk crystalline quartz supporting {{the accuracy of the}} technique, and the obtained standard deviation of less than 2. 7 % demonstrates the precision of this new measurement technique.

40|$|Damage {{tolerance}} testing {{development was}} required <b>to</b> help qualify <b>a</b> new spin forming dome fabrication {{process for the}} Ares 1 program at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). One challenge of the testing {{was due to the}} compound curvature of the dome. The testing was developed on a sub-scale dome with a diameter of approximately 40 inches. The simulated service testing performed was based on the EQTP 1102 Rev L 2195 Aluminum Lot Acceptance Simulated Service Test and Analysis Procedure generated by Lockheed Martin for the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank. This testing is performed on a specimen with an induced flaw of elliptical shape generated by Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) and subsequent fatigue cycling for crack propagation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>predetermined</b> length and <b>depth.</b> The specimen is then loaded in tension at a constant rate of displacement at room temperature until fracture occurs while recording load and strain. An identical specimen with a similar flaw is then proof tested at room temperature to imminent failure based on the critical offset strain achieved by the previous fracture test. If the specimen survives the proof, it is then subjected to cryogenic cycling with loads that are a percentage of the proof load performed at room temperature. If all cryogenic cycles are successful, the specimen is loaded in tension to failure {{at the end of the}} test. This standard was generated for flat plate, so a method of translating this <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specimen of compound curvature was required. This was accomplished by fabricating a fixture that maintained the curvature of the specimen rigidly with the exception of approximately one-half inch in the center of the specimen containing the induced flaw. This in conjunction with placing the center of the specimen in the center of the load train allowed for successful testing with a minimal amount of bending introduced into the system. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests were performed using the typical double beam assembly and with 4 -point loaded specimens under alternate immersion conditions in a 3. 5 % NaCl environment for 90 days. In addition, experiments were conducted to determine the threshold stress intensity factor for SCC (K 1 SCC) of Al-Li 2195 which to our knowledge has not been determined previously. The successful simulated service and stress corrosion testing helped to provide confidence to continue to Ares 1 scale dome fabrication...|$|R

30|$|The CRIP method {{relies on}} a {{combination}} of conventional drilling and directional drilling to access the coal seam and physically form a link between the injection and production wells, without the use of linking technologies utilized in LVW methods [38]. A vertical section of injection well is drilled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>predetermined</b> <b>depth,</b> after which directional drilling is used to expand the hole and drill along the bottom of the coal seam creating a horizontal injection well [40]. At the end of the injection well, a gasification cavity is initiated in a horizontal section of the coal seam, creating a localized reactor. The CRIP system utilizes a burner attached to retractable coiled tubing which is used to ignite the coal [39]. The burner burns through the borehole casing to ignite the coal. The ignition point can be moved to any desired location along the horizontal injection well {{for the creation of a}} new gasification cavity after a deteriorating reactor has been deserted [38]. Typically, the injection point is retracted using a gas burner, which burns a section of the liner at a desired location [39]. In this manner, accurate control of the gasification process can be obtained. This UCG method has gained popularity in Europe and the USA, but the use of the CRIP method for UCG is fairly new and currently has not become commonly employed [4].|$|E

40|$|Friction at {{contacting}} surfaces in relative motion {{is a major}} source of parasitic energy loss in machine systems and manufacturing processes. Consequently, friction reduction usually translates to efficiency gain and reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, friction at surfaces eventually leads to wear and failure of the components thereby compromising reliability and durability. In order to reduce friction and wear in tribological components, material surfaces are often hardened by a variety of methods, including conventional heat treatment, laser surface hardening, and thin-film coatings. While these surface treatments are effective when used in conjunction with lubrication to prevent failure, they are all energy intensive and could potentially add significant cost. A new concept for surface hardening of metallic materials and components is Friction Stir Processing (FSP). Compared to the current surface hardening technologies, FSP is more energy efficient has no emission or waste by products and may result in better tribological performance. FSP involves plunging a rotating tool <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>predetermined</b> <b>depth</b> (case layer thickness) and translating the FSP tool along the area to be processed. This action of the tool produces heating and severe plastic deformation of the processed area. For steel the temperature is high enough to cause phase transformation, ultimately forming hard martensitic phase. Indeed, FSP has been used for surface modification of several metals and alloys so as to homogenize the microstructure and refine the grain size, both of which led to improved fatigue and corrosion resistance. Based on the effect of FSP on near-surface layer material, it was expected to have beneficial effects on friction and wear performance of metallic materials. However, little or no knowledge existed on the impact of FSP concerning friction and wear performance the subject of the this project and final report. Specifically for steel, which is the most dominant tribological material, FSP can replace the current conventional surface hardening techniques used for friction and wear performance. Friction Stir Link Inc. (FSL) is teamed with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to develop and optimize FSP for friction and wear performance enhancement. The ultimate goal is to offer FSP and an effective alternative to some of the current energy intensive and high-cost surface hardening processes...|$|E
