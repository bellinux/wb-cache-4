25|$|Following the two fatal {{accidents}} in 2003 and 2005, the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment. There {{are a number}} of occupation crossings with local control, where the railway meets farm tracks, but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways, five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings. During the late 1970s to early 1980s, all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings (AOCLs) by installation of flashing warning lights. Between 2006 and 2016, twelve of them were upgraded to Automatic Barrier Crossing Locally Monitored (ABCL) status. This involved the decommissioning of the life expired AOCL control equipment, the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> systems, at a cost of around £90,000 per crossing.) On 22nd of March 2017 the crossing at Romney Sands was commissioned as an ABCL, this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close. During the single line crossing upgrades the Road Signal heads (Wig Wags) have either been replaced with new ones (Battery Road and Dungeness Road) or had their existing heads refurbished.|$|E

2500|$|The wreck was {{investigated}} by several agencies. [...] The truck driver, John R. Stokes, {{had been convicted}} of numerous traffic violations in the past, and his trucking company, Melco, had been cited for safety violations. [...] The NTSB's investigation placed the fault of the collision on Stokes and his failure to yield at the grade crossing, but the investigation by the Illinois State Police found that the <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> system had failed to detect the fast-moving (79 mph) Amtrak train {{at the beginning of the}} approach circuit and turn on the flashing lights and gates for the federally required 20 seconds. A witness saw the late activation and the gates coming down just as the front of the locomotive reached the crossing. That conclusion was confirmed by the chief engineer for the company that manufactured the track detection equipment, Harmon Industries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} signaling {{technology and}} subsequent enhancements {{used to control}} the trains was developed by Westinghouse. When revenue service began, [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies), trains that {{show up on the}} computer system as being in a specific place but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 volts rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for <b>train</b> <b>detection.</b> Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of [...] Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking— operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights — that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between Westinghouse, the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the state government (advised by University of California professor Dr. Bill Wattenburg), the federal government, and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service. Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system. In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary safety}} {{concerns}} with dark territory {{stems from the}} lack of any form of direct or indirect <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> along the route. <b>Train</b> <b>detection</b> systems such as track circuits not only alert other trains to the presence of a potential hazard, but can also alert dispatchers or other monitoring systems to the same. Dark territory also lacks the ability to control or lock switches onto the main track, detect misaligned switches, broken rails or runaway rail cars. In most cases these drawbacks are mitigated by the light traffic and low speed of the trains in dark territory, but a runaway train (such as the crude oil unit train in 2013's Lac-Mégantic derailment) will not respect limits on speed and is not detectable by rail traffic controllers on a line with no signals or track circuits.|$|E
