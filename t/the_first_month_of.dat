The Katyusha was inexpensive and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War in December 1941, the school's Wirraways were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia, while the base was fortified with sandbags, trenches, and gun pits. On 1January 1942, No.60 Squadron was established at Forest Hill from No.2 SFTS aircraft and personnel. Equipped with 18 Wirraways, the unit formed part of the expansion of the Australian military in response to the rapid Japanese advance in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific War. A contingent of 68 WAAAFs also began arriving at Forest Hill in January.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{finished}} the season 21–3 with a 1.77 ERA in 27 starts. He led the National League in numerous categories once again, such as ERA, ERA+, Wins, Win %, WHIP, IP/GS, SO/9, Strikeout-to-walk ratio, complete games, FIP, and Wins Above Replacement for both pitchers and all NL players. He also {{finished third in}} strikeouts despite missing most of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> the season. He was the first pitcher in history to win four consecutive ERA titles. Many experts called his 2014 season {{one of the best}} pitching seasons in recent memory.|$|E

He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E

5|$|Smith missed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> {{the season}} with a {{hamstring}} injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.|$|E

5|$|The {{passage of}} the Mayflower across the North Atlantic lasted more than two months, with 102 {{passengers}} crowded onto the cargo ship's gun deck and about 30 crew members. The seas were not severe during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> the voyage but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage.

5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E

Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After {{the end of the}} war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929.

5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), {{and the presence of}} civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E

Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{birth is}} an event {{in the life of}} people and {{therefore}} in their development process. The implications that stem from changes arising on many different levels require a variety of parental responses. This makes studying the problems of parents in the care <b>of</b> infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life a relevant issue. Objective: to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of parents with a one month old child and to identify the difficulties parents face in caring for their infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. Materials and methods: cross-sectional study, experimental, descriptive, with a non probabilistic sample of 88 parents. A questionnaire was applied in two parts, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> consisting of a socio-demographic and obstetrical configuration. The second part was applied to determine the difficulties of parents in the care <b>of</b> infants during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. Results and discussion: the study identifies and describes the difficulties experienced by parents in the care of newborns. It is essential to know the problems <b>of</b> parents during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life of their infants in order to promote better adaptation strategies for their new roles and to develop better parenting skills...|$|R
