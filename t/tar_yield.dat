Pre- and post-switch estimates of Mouth Level Exposure (MLE) to nicotine, 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK), pyrene and acrolein were obtained by chemical analysis of spent cigarette filters for nicotine content. Similarly, pre- and post-switch estimates of uptake of these smoke constituents were achieved by analysis of corresponding urinary biomarkers of exposure (BoE) : total nicotine equivalents; total 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL); total 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -OHP), and 3 -hydroxypropyl-mercapturic acid (3 -HPMA), plus the nicotine metabolite cotinine, in plasma and saliva.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Reducing <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> of {{manufactured}} cigarettes {{has been}} an important plank of government policy on tobacco, but sale weighted yields are not routinely published.  METHODS—Tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields measured by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist were combined with cigarette brand market shares from national surveys of smoking behaviour to generate sales weighted yield estimates for the period 1972 - 99.  RESULTS—Sales weighted mean <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> have declined steadily and in 1999 were 9. 6 mg per cigarette, less than half their level in 1972. Over the same period nicotine yields have come down from 1. 33 mg to 0. 79 mg per cigarette. Carbon monoxide yields have shown smaller declines. At the same time as absolute yields have declined, there have also been changes in tar to nicotine ratios. Smokers in 1999 were exposed to 22 % less tar per unit of nicotine than in 1973, and smokers of low tar brands have consistently been exposed to less tar per unit of nicotine than smokers of other brands.  CONCLUSIONS—The value of reducing cigarette <b>tar</b> and nicotine <b>yields</b> has been questioned, since the tendency of smokers to compensate for reductions in nicotine delivery undermines the policy. The favourable trends in tar to nicotine ratios suggest that, despite this, there may have been some modest public health benefit. It cannot be assumed that future reductions from present levels would necessarily result in further improvement in tar to nicotine ratios. An explicit focus on the ratio of tar to nicotine may provide a metric of greater relevance for public health than the present emphasis on absolute <b>tar</b> <b>yields.</b> ...|$|R

More than one-third of male smokers' and one-half of female smokers' current brands had <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> below 12 mg; less than 9 % of male smokers' and 4 % of female smokers' current brands had <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> of 20. 2 mg or more (nonfilters). The study population differed in many respects from the general U. S. population; the study population had, for example, a much higher average educational level. Nevertheless, distributions of smoking habits changed a few percentage points after adjustment to the educational level of the general population...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBiomass {{gasification}} in Entrained Flow Reactor (EFR) is both {{studied with}} experiments in a drop tube reactor and modelling with a 1 -D model (GASPAR). Operating conditions are chosen thanks to {{results of a}} preliminary modelling of an industrial EFR. Influence of addition of steam (0. 55 g/g db), carbon dioxide (0. 87 g/g db) and oxygen (Equivalent Ratio: 0 - 0. 61) is investigated between 800 and 1400 degrees C with beech wood particles sieved between 315 and 450 mu m as feedstock. The model takes into account pyrolysis reaction, gas phase reaction with a detailed chemical scheme (176 species, 5988 reactions), char gasification by steam and CO 2 and soot formation. H 2 O or CO 2 addition has no influence on gasification product yields at 800 and 1000 degrees C, while at 1200 and 1400 degrees C the char gasification is significantly enhanced and soot formation is certainly inhibited by OH radical which reacts with soot precursors. The modification of output gas phase composition is mostly due to WGS reaction which reaches thermodynamic equilibrium from about 1200 degrees C. As expected, O- 2 has a significant influence on gas and <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> through combustion reactions. Char and soot yields decrease as ER increases. The GASPAR model allows a good prediction of gas and char and gives relevant evolution of soot and <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> on {{the large majority of}} conditions studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{facilitate}} the production of carbon fibers from low-rank coal (LRC) tars. To this end, the effect of demineralization on the <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> and composition was investigated using high-sodium and high-calcium lignites commonly mined in North Dakota. These coals were demineralized by ion exchange with ammonium acetate and by cation dissolution with nitric acid. Two types of thermal processing were investigated for obtaining suitable precursors for pitch and fiber production. Initially, tars were produced by simple pyrolysis of the set of samples at 650 C. Since these experiments produced little usable material {{from any of the}} samples, the coals were heated at moderate temperatures (380 and 400 C) in tetralin solvent to form and extract the plastic material (metaplast) that forms at these temperatures...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{relation between}} <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> of manufactured cigarettes and mortality from smoking related diseases. DESIGN [...] Prospective epidemiological study of four cohorts of men studied between 1967 and 1982. SETTING [...] Combined data from British United Provident Association (BUPA) study (London), Whitehall study (London), Paisley-Renfrew study (Scotland), and United Kingdom heart disease prevention project (England and Wales). SUBJECTS [...] Of the 56, 255 men aged over 35 who {{were included in}} the studies, 2742 deaths occurred among 12, 400 smokers. Average follow up was 13 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Relative mortality from smoking related diseases according to tar yields of cigarettes smoked. RESULTS [...] Age adjusted mortality from smoking related diseases in smokers of filter cigarettes was 9 % lower (95 % confidence interval 1 % to 17 %) than in smokers related diseases consistently decreased with decreasing <b>tar</b> <b>yield.</b> Relative mortality in cigarette smokers for a 15 mg decrease in <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> per cigarette was 0. 75 (0. 52 to 1. 09) for lung cancer, 0. 77 (0. 61 to 0. 97) for coronary heart disease, 0. 86 (0. 50 to 1. 50) for stroke, 0. 78 (0. 40 to 1. 48) for chronic obstructive lung diseases, 0. 78 (0. 65 to 0. 93) for these smoking related diseases combined, and 0. 77 (0. 65 to 0. 90) for all smoking related diseases. CONCLUSION [...] About a quarter of deaths from lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and possibly other smoking related diseases would have been avoided by lowering <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> from 30 mg per cigarette to 15 mg. Reducing cigarette tar yields in Britain has had a modest effect in reducing smoking related mortality...|$|E
40|$|A newly {{configured}} fixed-bed reactor with internals {{has been}} proposed to enhance the coal pyrolysis performance. In this study, the effects of metallic plates on coal pyrolysis behavior were investigated in this reactor. The {{results show that the}} increased quantity of the metallic plates enhanced the heat transfer and shortened the residence time of volatiles within the coal particles. In addition, the pressure drop results suggest that the increased quantity of plates caused short circuiting of gas and raised the particle interstices, which reduced the gas diffusion resistance of pyrolysis products. Therefore, more gaseous pyrolysis products flowed into central low-temperature coal bed and escaped from the gas collection pipe, suppressing the secondary reaction of pyrolysis products and increasing the <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> and quality. At a furnace temperature of 900 degrees C, the increase in metallic plates from 0 to 8 raised the <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> and light tar fraction from 5. 20 and 69. 5 wt % to 7. 86 and 77. 0 wt %, respectively. Meanwhile, the = C- 20 hydrocarbons were lowered from 29. 95 to 19. 74 wt %. However, an excessive increase in plates raised the heating rate of coal, cracking more pyrolysis products and decreasing the <b>tar</b> <b>yield</b> and quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{logic of}} expecting people who cannot stop smoking {{to switch to}} {{cigarettes}} that have hardly any nicotine is questionable. <b>Tar</b> and nicotine <b>yields</b> of cigarettes available in Britain today correlate 0 - 93, and further reduction of tar intake {{is limited by the}} reluctance of smokers to tolerate similar reductions in nicotine. A new approach would be to aim at lowering <b>tar</b> <b>yields</b> of cigarettes from the present average of 18 mg to around 6 mg but maintaining nicotine yields at around 1 - 0 to 1 - 2 mg, which would be acceptable to most smokers. This approach requires that emphasis be placed on tar: nicotine ratios {{as well as on the}} absolute yields. These ratios for brands on sale in Britain today average 14 - 2 and range from 9 - 6 to 20 - 8. They provide an additional guide for comparing the relative harmfulness of different brands. For example, 35 % of cigarette smokers in Britain smoke either Embassy Filter or Players No 6 Filter; by changing to John Player Carlton King Size they could reduce their tar intake by more than 20 % without having to suffer any nicotine deprivation...|$|R
