5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E
5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E

25|$|The Director's Cut is {{a series}} of reinterpretations of motion picture theme songs.

In 1979, Cinefantastique noted the remarkable similarities between this atmospheric sequence and a lengthy scene in the then-new Alien. The magazine also pointed out other minor parallels between the two films. However, both Aliens director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon claimed at the time that they had never seen Planet of the Vampires.|$|E

The hall's classic lines and visually arresting elegance host cutting-edge exhibition technology and the latest scientific research on the ocean. The 29,000-square-foot (2,700 m²) Hall {{has been transformed into}} a fully immersive marine environment with high-definition video projections, interactive computer stations, hands-on models, 14 renovated classic dioramas, and eight new ocean ecosystem displays that transport visitors from the rainbow-hued profusion of life in the Indo-Pacific coral reefs to the flickering bioluminescence of fishes in <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> darkness of the deep sea. The exhibit was first created by the AMNH Exhibitions Lab in 1933, was renovated in 1969 and once again in 2003 through funding provided by Paul and Irma Milstein.|$|E

500|$|Graham {{originally}} {{suggested a}} story about a man who had the ability to drain Earth of its beauty, but Davies preferred his own idea about <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> nature of paintings or illustration. The Isolus was inspired by the villains in the 1978 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Early drafts of this episode were titled [...] "Chloe Webber Destroys the Earth", and later, [...] "You're a Bad Girl, Chloe Webber", with one such draft having the episode take place on another planet. Both of these titles were rejected by Davies as they were too long.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] {{during a}} period that marked his {{emergence}} as a prolific songwriter, coinciding with {{his return to the}} guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar. His musical inspiration for the song was [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" [...] by Bob Dylan, while the understated arrangement reflects the influence of the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink. The Beatles recorded the song in London {{towards the end of the}} troubled sessions for the White Album. Sequenced to follow the heavy rock-styled [...] "Helter Skelter", the otherwise gentle and meditative track ends with a partly improvised segment, which was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> sound of a wine bottle vibrating on a speaker in the recording studio.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, <b>the</b> <b>eerie</b> {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything {{that goes on in}} this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E
