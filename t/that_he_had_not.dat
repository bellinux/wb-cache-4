5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> died, that his funeral was staged, {{and that he}} had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her.

He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E

The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. He conceded, however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> examined any specimens.|$|E
