5|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} remarked, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have been}} reserved {{to the people of}} this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{as if he has}} been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
25|$|The supreme {{fiction is}} that {{conceptualization}} of reality {{that seems to}} resonate in its rightness, so much so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to have captured, {{if only for a}} moment, something actual and real.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} Kwang-chih Chang said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{like the}} Mongoloid race originated in South China, {{and he said}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like the Mongoloid race was differentiating itself from other races in the Late Pleistocene. Chang based these thoughts on a skull found in Sichuan and a skull found in Guangxi.|$|R

25|$|I do {{not believe}} that the present sombre {{prospect}} in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the 19th century <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> hardly possible that the earnest demand of good peoples throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered.|$|E
25|$|Soviet sources {{list the}} deaths of 474,967 of the 2,652,672 German Armed Forces taken {{prisoner}} in the War. Dr. Rüdiger Overmans believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> entirely plausible, while not provable, that an additional German military personnel listed as missing actually died in Soviet custody as POWs, putting the estimates of the actual death toll of German POW in the USSR at about 1.0 million.|$|E
25|$|Ritual: green {{obsidian}} ornaments as rich offerings {{for high}} rank individuals. Such {{is the case}} of pieces found within skull in some burials, as if these were placed in the person’s mouth; these pieces are spherical or semi-square and always of green stone. In these same conditions a small rectangular piece was found, with an edge perforation, of a dark green stone and so polished <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> mirror.|$|E

25|$|Second, Kennedy {{examined}} the statutory framework of Title VII, {{to determine whether}} Title VII's proscription of disparate treatment is afforded any lawful justifications in the disparate impact provision <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to conflict with. Looking to analogous Equal Protection cases, he reached the statutory construction that, in instances of conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, permissible justifications for disparate treatment must be grounded in the strong-basis-in-evidence standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{agreement}} during the 1990s by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Australian and EU governments, the others' GIs and the nations' traditional terms of winemaking {{were meant to}} have been protected by 1997. However, this has been proceeding slowly, and while some GIs have been protected in Australia, others are still available for use (primarily for products that have always been called <b>that).</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely it will {{have any effect on}} colloquial speech in the short term.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand, {{commonly}} referred to as the All Blacks, are the most successful team in international rugby. They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74% The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with The Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to them <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> almost impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'.|$|E
25|$|Though {{from this}} plant, {{collected}} by Endert {{on the last}} Borneo expedition, the pitchers are unknown, the other parts are so peculiar and differ from all other species in such a striking manner, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> allowed to me to base a new species on it. It was found on a steep mountain slope, covered with dense forest at 1800 m above sea level. It reminds {{one to the other}} species, discovered by Endert on the same mountain, viz. N. fusca, by its colour and its red-brown indumentum, but it differs by its quite other leaf shape and nervation, and its still denser indumentum.|$|E
25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, {{one way to}} try to avert it was to simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to have been a common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E

25|$|The {{court case}} was {{postponed}} several times, but went ahead on January 12, 2010. Apparently no observers were {{allowed in the}} court, and the defence lawyers, who have had nearly no access to the defendants for two years, also had difficulty entering the court. The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{that the government has}} already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law. Further sessions were held on February 7, 2010, April 12, 2010 and June 12, 2010. On August 11, 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners, which was later reduced to ten years. After the sentence, they were transferred to Gohardasht prison. In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years.|$|E
25|$|One of the ‘B’ {{variants}} (Hill ‘6’) has a copyist’s gloss which {{proposes a}} meaning of ‘27,000 and 70 hides’ {{to make sense}} of the “27 and 70” reference: the “belong to it” refers to the entire list enumerated, a grand total. However, none of the ‘B’ lists can give us that total as they miss out between three and five burh. Therefore, the archetype of ‘B’ must have included these, as did that of ‘A’. However, by recalculating the mistranscriptions and supplying the missing burh figures from ‘A’ then the ‘restored’ total would be 28,671. Hill then turns to the second part of the final sentence “and 30 to the West Saxons”, this too is glossed as ‘30,000’ by the copyist ‘6’ so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to refer to hides; but Hill proposes that it refers to the 30 burh; there are in fact 31 of these in the combined lists, but he then proposes that Buckingham (at 1600 hides) is in fact Mercian, that is not of “the West Saxons”, so is not included in the grand total. The adjusted total of 27,071 then concurs with the final ‘B’ sentence/statement.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
