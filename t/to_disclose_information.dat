5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>information</b> promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{framework}} of the ISA, detainees are theoretically accorded due process. For instance, detainees have a right to make representations against their detention to an advisory board.

Therefore, there is no means to compel the authorities <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>information</b> which may be pertinent for the detainee to make a proper representation to an advisory board, thus compromising due process.

Indeed, many Internet businesses have been offering consumers economic benefits (like monetary rewards) {{in exchange for their}} personal information.

This study investigates how social adjustment benefits (a type of psychological benefits based on human need for affiliation) can be used by Internet businesses to induce consumers <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> their personal <b>information.</b> Drawing on psychology literature, this study focuses on the match between consumer characteristics (extraversion) and the media (electronic and traditional) used to offer social adjustment benefits.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} set to {{investigate}} the factors that affect the intention <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> personal <b>information</b> <b>to</b> SNS providers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify factors and how these factors affect the behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> personal <b>information</b> <b>to</b> SNS from a new angle of analysis, namely through a user-to-organizational approach. By examining this phenomenon in a new context, this study seeks to provide an understanding of this phenomenon in a new setting and test if previous research can be used to explain the stated behavioral intention. With this argumentation in mind, the thesis aims to contribute to existing theory in consumer behavior, social networking sites, privacy concerns and personal information disclosure. In order to do so this paper is built on a quantitative research approach where the main research strategy is based on the results of a questionnaire. Through the questionnaire, a proposed framework was tested in order to identify factors affecting peoples’ intentions <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> personal <b>information</b> <b>to</b> SNS providers. The model was built upon the structure of privacy calculation theory, which has been proven to identify intentions <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> personal <b>information</b> in online settings. The results show that the factors that significantly affect behavioral intentions are trusting beliefs and self-presentations. They are factors leading to personal information disclosure to SNS providers. Limitations of this study is that it suffers a sampling restrictions due to its sampling of only Swedish inhabitants. This paper is the first to develop and empirically test an integrated model of personal information disclosure to SNS, taking on a user-to-organizational approach to privacy. Since SNS are financially evaluated by number of active users of their SNS it is crucial to understand the factors that affect consumers’ intention <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> their personal <b>information.</b> From the empirical findings, this study proved that trust and self-presentation determine the intentions <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> personal <b>information</b> <b>to</b> SNS providers. The results shows a discrepancy of existing literature, explaining differences between user-to-user and user-to-organizational context, and thus broadening the context of personal disclosure in the SNS realm. Practitioners can, by using the insights, tailor their strategies in order to maximize the efforts of affecting potential users’ <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> their personal <b>information,</b> which SNS providers are dependent upon. ...|$|R
