5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in <b>transitional</b> <b>provisions</b> to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the plan was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina (Part One). Part One defined Krajina as an {{autonomous}} region of Croatia, with borders {{based on the results}} of the 1991 Croatian census (which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority). Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right to levy taxes and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two of the plan, the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 (including eastern and western Slavonia) and contained <b>transitional</b> <b>provisions.</b> Part Three of the plan spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human-rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia would be the first to be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia (where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover).|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, the {{territory}} was {{placed under the}} Nagaland <b>Transitional</b> <b>Provisions</b> Regulation, 1961 which provided for an Interim body consisting of 45 members to be elected by tribes according to the customs, traditions and usage of the respective tribes. Subsequently, Nagaland attained statehood with {{the enactment of the}} state of Nagaland Act in 1962 by the Parliament. The interim body was dissolved on 30 November 1963 and the state of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963 and Kohima was declared as the state capital. After elections in January 1964, the first democratically elected Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on 11 February 1964.|$|E
25|$|Due to the <b>transitional</b> <b>provisions</b> of the constitution, Pinochet {{remained}} as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then {{sworn in as}} a senator-for-life, a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent immunity from prosecution protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the United Kingdom, on an extradition request issued by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón, allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon. The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama Pinochet in Suburbia, with Pinochet played by Derek Jacobi. Shortly before giving the power, Pinochet prohibited all forms of abortion, previously authorized in case of rape or risk {{to the life of}} the mother.|$|E

2500|$|The Constitutional Court {{comprises}} nine members. Membership of the Constitutional Court {{is open to}} any {{citizen of}} the Republic aged 35 or over.

Five members of the Constitutional Court are elected by the National Assembly upon the recommendation of the Chairman of the National Assembly. The other four members are appointed by the President of the Republic, at his/her discretion. The President of the Constitutional Court is not elected by the members of the Constitutional Court.

2500|$|There {{were two}} other main {{potential}} interpretations of section 41, {{both of which}} suggested that the section was only ever {{intended to be a}} transitional provision, to preserve the status quo until the Parliament of Australia could pass its own laws about elections and voting. The first interpretation was that section 41 only applied to people who were already entitled to vote when the Constitution of Australia came into effect, an argument first advanced by William Harrison Moore. The second argument was that it could apply to people who acquired a right after the Constitution came into effect, but only if they acquired that right {{on the basis of a}} state law which was in force before the Constitution came into effect, an argument put forward by John Quick and Robert Garran. The four people argued that neither of these interpretations should apply, because section 41 was not a transitional provision. They argued that if it were, it would have been worded like other <b>transitional</b> <b>provisions,</b> including the usual phrase [...] "until Parliament otherwise provides".|$|E

2500|$|The second main {{legislative}} body is the Council, which {{is composed of}} different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a [...] "European Council" [...] (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', {{but it does not}} itself exercise 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bind the member states in decisions. When voting takes place, where unanimity is not required, a [...] "qualified majority" [...] (defined as a majority of 55% of the Member States representing 65% {{of the population of the}} Union) can approve legislation. This replaces a previous system where votes were weighted according to member state size, (Germany, France, Italy, and UK: 29 votes each. Spain and Poland: 27. Romania: 14. Netherlands: 13. Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal: 12. Bulgaria, Austria, Sweden: 10. Denmark, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Finland: 7. Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia: 4. Malta: 3.) This was set by the 2014 Protocol No 36 on <b>Transitional</b> <b>Provisions,</b> art 3(3) amended by art 20 for Croatia Accession Treaty 2011. In total there were 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes.
