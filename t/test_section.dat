5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|Further {{testing of}} Silverplate B-29 {{aircraft}} and Thin Man and Fat Man bomb shapes {{was carried out}} at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944. Testing shifted to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, in October. Project Y controlled the scheduling and contents of the tests, which were {{carried out by the}} Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit as Project W-47. The tests were supervised by Ramsey until November, when Commander Frederick Ashworth became Parson's head of operations, and assumed responsibility for the test program. The test bombs were assembled by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Special Ordnance Detachment. Tests continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. At first only the Ordnance Division's fuse and delivery groups were involved, but as the tests became more detailed, and live explosives were incorporated into the test bombs, other groups were drawn into the test program.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 Eiffel's {{laboratory}} {{was moved}} to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a 2-metre <b>test</b> <b>section</b> is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved {{the efficiency of the}} open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow straightener and adding a diffuser between the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> and the fan located at the downstream end of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the four}} <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> (reading, listening, writing, and speaking) {{accounts}} for 25% of the exam. Per <b>tested</b> <b>section,</b> {{it is possible to}} acquire a maximum of 24 points, and, depending on the acquired points in each section, the language proficiency level of said section is decided. The DSD II is presented to the candidate if he/she reached B2-level or higher in all <b>tested</b> <b>sections.</b> Scores above B2 are presented as C1-scores on the diploma. The DSD I is presented to the candidate if he/she reached in all <b>tested</b> <b>sections</b> B1-level or higher of language proficiency in German. Below DSD I, a DSD A2 is presented to the candidate if he/she reached at least or higher A2-level of language proficiency in German in all <b>tested</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} been {{intended}} {{to find out the}} question of how the three different types of glossing, i. e. glossing in both Chinese and English, glossing in Chinese, glossing in English, exert effects on the incidental vocabulary acquisition through reading. Two <b>testing</b> <b>sections</b> are involved in this study, including the immediate retention <b>testing</b> <b>section</b> and the delayed retention <b>testing</b> <b>section.</b> Based on this finding, implications for the field of foreign language teaching and suggestions have been put forward...|$|R
25|$|Fog (usually {{from water}} particles) is created with an {{ultrasonic}} piezoelectric nebulizer. The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit and closed <b>test</b> <b>section</b> type). An electrically heated grid is inserted before the <b>test</b> <b>section,</b> which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity, thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a light sheet.|$|E
25|$|In February 1944, Baumgartner {{transferred}} to Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio {{for a temporary}} assignment to test aeromedical equipment being designed for the WASP program. While in Ohio, Baumgartner applied for an assignment in the Flight Test Division at Wright Field as an assistant operations officer. In March 1944 she was {{transferred to}} Wright Field as an assistant operations officer in the fighter <b>test</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following his repatriation, Gabreski {{returned}} to the United States and married Kay Cochran on June 11, 1945. After a 90-day recuperative leave, he became Chief of Fighter <b>Test</b> <b>Section</b> at Wright Field, Ohio, {{and at the same}} time completed test pilot training at its Engineering Flight Test School. In April 1946, he left the service, worked for Douglas Aircraft for a year, then was recalled to active duty in April 1947 to command the 55th Fighter Squadron, 20th Fighter Group, at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina.|$|E
40|$|The Minnesota Road Research (MnROAD) {{facility}} {{was constructed in}} the early 1990 ’s to include fourteen plain jointed concrete pavement <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> Nine of the <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> are interstate highway designs with design lives of 5 or 10 years. The other five <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> are low-volume road designs. With traffic loading beginning in 1994, the <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> have now experienced over 10 years of load and environmental effects. During that time, {{a tremendous amount of}} data collection and research analysis has taken place. The condition and ride performance of the concrete pavement <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> is characterized. Significant findings from selected studies are presented. The performance of the 5 -year and 10 -year design test cells shows that Mn/DOT’s current concrete pavement design method needs significant improvement. The lessons learned from the operation of the MnROAD project can be used to improve the next generation of concrete pavement design methods and test facilities...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to the U.S., Lt. Colonel Ascani was {{transferred}} to the Flight Test Division at Wright Field where he was assigned chief of the bomber <b>test</b> <b>section.</b> He attended the Flight Performance School (now the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School) and graduated with class 46. In January 1946, Ascani met his new boss, Colonel Al Boyd, who would {{have a significant impact on}} both USAF flight test and Ascani's career. Boyd and Ascani worked well together, and Ascani became Boyd’s deputy both at Wright Field and later at Edwards Air Force Base. One notable decision made by Boyd and Ascani was the pilot choice for who would first break the sound barrier. Although Ascani had initially recommended Major Ken Chilstrom, they eventually agreed that Chuck Yeager would pilot the Bell X-1, and Chilstrom would fly the performance, stability and control tests in the new XP-86. During his tour at Edwards AFB, Ascani flew a wide variety of research aircraft including the X-1, X-4, X-5, and the XF-92A. A highlight of his flying career occurred in 1951 when he flew an F-86E at the National Air Show in Detroit, Michigan, and established a new 100-kilometer closed course speed record of 635mph. In September 1951, Colonel Ascani was named vice commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB.|$|E
500|$|While the Vallejo {{section of}} SR 37 was being updated, {{another problem with}} the route would hinder its progress. The section between Sears Point and Mare Island was plagued with fatal accidents, earning its {{nickname}} of [...] "Blood Alley". Between 1966 and 1970, 27 people lost their lives to it. In a preliminary effort to reduce the fatalities, officials established both a daylight <b>test</b> <b>section,</b> requiring all cars to keep their headlights on during the day, and passing lanes. However, these efforts were ineffective.|$|E
500|$|Section 8B(1) {{returned}} the law governing judicial review to that [...] "applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971", the day Lee Mau Seng was decided. In addition, the provision stated that no decision on {{or after the}} date from any other Commonwealth country would apply in Singapore. This was intended to overturn the dicta in Chng Suan Tze that an objective test was to be preferred, and to restrict the courts to applying the subjective <b>test.</b> <b>Section</b> 8B(2) further entrenched this by limiting judicial review only to questions of [...] "compliance with any procedural requirement of [...] ".|$|E

30|$|In addition, the {{three-dimensional}} FE model {{was developed to}} analyze the mechanical behavior of the ICC and the standard mix concrete under Florida climate condition. The FE model developed was validated and calibrated using the HVS load-induced strains from the full-scale <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> The verified model was then {{used to evaluate the}} potential performance of these <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> under critical temperature-load condition in Florida.|$|R
40|$|In 1995 {{a series}} of six {{grounding}} experiments {{has been carried out}} with a 600 Tonne inland water way tanker. At the how of the vessel <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> could be fitted, which were run into an artificial rock. The design of the support structures for the <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> and for the rock required the prediction of grounding forces and ship motions. The crash behaviour of the <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> was assessed by applving explicit finite element calculations. Hydrodynamic forces were investigated by running 3 -D diffraction calculations. This paper deals with the design approach for the grounding experiments and gives some details on the calculation methods used. Predicted loods and penetrations are compared with measured values...|$|R

2500|$|The airflow {{created by}} the fans that is {{entering}} the tunnel is itself highly turbulent due to the fan blade motion (when the fan is blowing air into the <b>test</b> <b>section</b> – when it is sucking {{air out of the}} <b>test</b> <b>section</b> downstream, the fan-blade turbulence is not a factor), and so is not directly useful for accurate measurements. The air moving through the tunnel needs to be relatively turbulence-free and [...] To correct this problem, closely spaced vertical and horizontal air vanes are used to smooth out the turbulent airflow before reaching the subject of the testing.|$|E
40|$|Appendices; Figures; References; TablesThis study {{examined}} the roughness and roughness progression of 21 <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> on the LTPP SPS- 2 site in Arizona over the first 16 years of the experiment. The site included 12 <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> from the standard experiment and 9 supplemental <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> selected by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Traditional profile analyses revealed roughness caused by transverse and longitudinal cracking on some <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> and some localized roughness caused by built-in defects. However, the analyses showed that curl and warp contributed to, {{and in some cases}} dominated, the roughness on many of the <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> In addition, roughness did not increase steadily with time because of diurnal and seasonal changes in slab curl and warp. This study applied objective profile analyses to quantify the level of curl and warp on each section. These automated algorithms estimated the gross strain gradient needed to deform each slab into the shape present in the measured profile and produced a pseudo strain gradient (PSG) value. The levels of curl and warp within each profile are summarized by the average PSG value. For the jointed concrete <b>test</b> <b>sections,</b> variations in average PSG over time explained many of the changes in roughness over time. This included diurnal variations in slab curl, which often caused the overall progression in roughness to appear disorderly throughout the experiment. PSG analysis also revealed that the overall level of curl and warp increased throughout the life of the experiment, with commensurate increases in the roughness. This limited study demonstrated the potential value of applying the methods herein to other jointed portland cement concrete pavements, including other SPS- 2 sites...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for determining wind tunnel wall effects for complex models using the low-order, three dimensional panel method PMARC (Panel Method Ames Research Center) has been developed. Initial {{validation of the}} technique was performed using lift-coefficient data in the linear lift range from tests of a large-scale STOVL fighter model in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) facility. The data from these tests served as an ideal database for validating the technique because the same model was tested in two wind tunnel <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> with widely different dimensions. The lift-coefficient data obtained for the same model configuration in the two <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> were different, indicating a significant influence {{of the presence of}} the tunnel walls and mounting hardware on the lift coefficient in {{at least one of the}} two <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> The wind tunnel wall effects were computed using PMARC and then subtracted from the measured data to yield corrected lift-coefficient versus angle-of-attack curves. The corrected lift-coefficient curves from the two wind tunnel <b>test</b> <b>sections</b> matched very well. Detailed pressure distributions computed by PMARC on the wing lower surface helped identify the source of large strut interference effects in one of the wind tunnel <b>test</b> <b>sections.</b> Extension of the technique to analysis of wind tunnel wall effects on the lift coefficient in the nonlinear lift range and on drag coefficient will require the addition of boundary-layer and separated-flow models to PMARC...|$|R

This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was {{installed}} in the 1980s. The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated, {{with an emphasis on}} estimating the accuracy of computational methods. Aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions are explored. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of models or aircraft undergoing investigation.
