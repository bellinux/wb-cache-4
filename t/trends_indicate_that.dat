40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{examined the}} effect of frequent, complex and dissimilar interruptions on multitasking and prospective memory (PM) performance in a computer-based student study setting. Participants were either uninterrupted or unexpectedly interrupted three times while performing four study-related tasks, {{in addition to an}} event-based PM task. Our results show that PM, multitasking and multitasking-related behaviours, such as task-switching, were unaffected by interruptions. However, we discovered a <b>trend</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> the time spent on each individual task varied depending on whether or not participants were interrupted. This suggests that the interruptions caused participants to focus on different tasks, engaging in a different strategy to optimise performance and perform on par with uninterrupted participants. Surprisingly, we also found a <b>trend</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> uninterrupted participants were more likely to forget components of the PM task compared to interrupted participants. Thus, it appears that interruptions also had a positive effect, allowing more opportunities for participants to step back from immediate multitasking goals and rehearse previous PM intentions. Taken together, our findings show that students are generally good at dealing with short interruptions, and that interruptions can even have a beneficial effect in demanding multitasking situations...|$|R

30|$|Since the {{objective}} of our optimization problem is to maximize the weighted sum rate while guaranteeing the minimum PU rate (CPU ≥ φCPUo, 0 ≤ φ < 1), it can be expected that the sum rate is non-decreasing with λ as shown in Figures 5 and 8. However, at high value of λ (approaching 1), the achieved sum rate becomes saturated.

Singapore, though being a highly urbanised island-city-state, still manages to retain a surprisingly rich array of biodiversity by virtue of its geographical location within a biodiversity hotspot. Therefore, Singapore is well suited and equipped with relevant expertise to establish a cities' biodiversity index.|$|E

In Kuwait, researchers have concluded that current trends of activity in the region, mainly stemming from Kuwait's oil production, can cause a 1.6 °C increase in climate regionally by 2035 if no mitigation occurs.|$|E
50|$|Mastery of politeness and honorifics is {{important}} for functioning in Japanese society. Not speaking politely enough can be insulting, and speaking too politely can be distancing (and therefore also insulting) or seem sarcastic.

Recent <b>trends</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the importance of proper politeness is not as high as before, particularly in metropolitan areas.

Econometric tests <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> this common-stochastic-trend/cointegration implication is consistent with postwar U. S. data.
