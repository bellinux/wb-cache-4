50|$|Cant {{gradient}} is {{the amount}} by which cant is increased or decreased in a given length of track. The change in cant is {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no cant) to a curved track (with cant) through a transition curve. The rate of change of cant is used to determine the suitable cant gradient for a given design speed. <b>Track</b> <b>twist</b> may also be used to describe cant gradient which may be expressed in percentage of cant change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> is normally used in the context of cant gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|E

50|$|A zero-gravity roll or zero-g roll is {{a roller}} coaster {{inversion}} where the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> 360 degrees as it rises and falls in elevation, usually at {{the crest of a}} hill. The element gets its name from the weightless effect of zero g-force that a rider experiences during the inversion.|$|R
50|$|On 6 October 2000 {{an eight}} car Tangara train derailed {{at low speed}} near Kingsgrove station on the East Hills line, causing the rear three {{carriages}} to topple onto its side. The cause was a <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> {{as a result of}} very high temperatures. Ten people were hospitalised.|$|E
50|$|Twist Magic {{returned}} in the Haldon Gold Cup {{for the third}} year running, this time failing by half a length to concede 19 lbs to his stablemate Tchico Polos, who was ridden by Ruby Walsh. Plans to run in the Tingle Creek were scuppered when Sandown was lost to the weather and the race was transferred to Cheltenham, a <b>track</b> <b>Twist</b> Magic did not prefer. Instead he was rerouted to the Peterborough Chase, also rearranged due to frost and held this year at Newbury. Although initially reluctant to start, Twist Magic had taken the lead and was travelling powerfully when he fell at the second last fence and fractured a fetlock, resulting in him being put down. Jockey Sam Thomas escaped unharmed. Trainer Paul Nicholls paid tribute, calling him “such a wonderful horse” and the injury “a real tragedy”.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{tests of}} bogie {{rotation}} friction using the Centre for Railway Engineering’s heavy test lab facility {{have been completed}} for the Rail CRC Project 82 -Bogie Rotation Friction Management. These tests {{are believed to be}} the first in the world to rotate a full three piece bogie with <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> loads applied to the wagon-bogie system. The lab testing expands on the simulation studies reported at the last CORE. The objectives of the project 82 laboratory test program were to validate the behaviours of centre bowl friction force occurring during curve transitions as identified in previous simulation studies. The testing included: Centre bearing longitudinal movement in transitions due to <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> loads, or the walking motion of the centre bearing that generates rim contact and adds rim contact rotational resistance [and] Change in the effective radius of friction rotation for the centre bearing due to centre bearing tilt from <b>track</b> <b>twist,</b> and the additional change in the rotational centre when rim contact occurs. Results include the effective centre of rotation and frictional effective radius in the centre bow as altered with pitching force on the bogie. The testing results show that no sliding movement occurs at the CCSB’s until large curving rotations of the bolster occur due to the low elastic stiffness of the CCSB resilient blocks. This has implications for simulation modelling of hunting performance and future CCSB design...|$|E

50|$|A top hat, {{also known}} as top cap, is an element {{typically}} found on launched coasters. The element consists of 90-degree ascent up a hill, followed by a 90-degree descent; the train exits {{in the same direction}} from which it entered. In a standard configuration, the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> so that the train does not invert during the ride. Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point and Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure are two roller coasters that feature a top hat element.|$|R
50|$|A dive loop, {{also known}} as a diving loop, is a type of B&M and Gerstlauer roller coaster {{inversion}} whose inspiration was taken from a stunt plane maneuver. The <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> upwards and to the side and then dives toward the ground in a half-vertical loop. This element is common on many B&M roller coasters. Arrow and Vekoma use a similar version of the element known as a reverse sidewinder, as seen in Arrow's Cyclone at Dreamworld in Australia and Vekoma's Ninja at Six Flags over Georgia.|$|R
30|$|Presently, Trafikverket is {{responsible}} for gathering track condition data. Schunnesson et al. [13] described tamping, a maintenance strategy at Trafikverket, and evaluated the measurement effectiveness. Tamping aims to improve the track quality by optimising the track geometry maintenance strategy. Bergquist and Söderholm [14] proposed an approach {{to be used for}} condition assessment of tracks. This approach ensures earlier fault warnings while the traditional approach uses a control chart to assess the <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> condition. Schunnesson’s strategy relies on the real track geometry data, while the approach in Ref. [14]. relies on visual inspection of the track condition. Sadeghi and Askarinejad [15] developed a new track degradation model in two formats. This model can provide better understanding of the long-term behaviour of railway track system. Vale and Ribeiro [16] proposed a condition-based maintenance model formulated as a nonlinear program that characterised the deterioration rate of the standard deviation. They simulated the deterioration rate using Monte Carlo techniques on the real data, with the goal of optimising tamping and predicting its need in ballasted tracks.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{machines}} used for the maintenance and construction on railway lines. There are being presented the meaning, scope and methods of maintenance of the railway infrastructure, including the description and maintenance of the railway track elements. Examples of maintenance are made in accordance to the slovenian legislation on the railway substructure and superstructure. In the following thesis {{a detailed description of}} the machinery, which is, based on their functional ability, divided into construction, transport and trackside equipment is given. Also the vehicle for the different measurements (e. g. rail measurements – rail profile and rail corrugation, track geometry measurements, <b>track</b> <b>twist</b> and track cant measurements) are described. In the last part of the diploma thesis is being shown the technology of the renewal on the section of a single track railway line between the train stations Škofljica and Ljubljana Rakovnik. The renewal works are divided into six stages, which include removal of the existing track, excavation of the rails and sleepers, ballast bed and subsoil, installation of the improved subsoil and frost protective layer and laying of a new railway track. Besides the technology of the works on the open track section, with the help of MS Project software, a schedule is being designed, which shows the duration, order and delay of implementing individual works on the section of the considered track...|$|E
50|$|Siena {{hosts the}} start and finish of the Strade Bianche, a {{professional}} cycling race famous for its historic white gravel roads, called strade bianche or sterrati in Italian. More than 50 km of the race is run over dirt roads, usually country lanes and farm <b>tracks</b> <b>twisting</b> through the hills and vineyards of the Chianti region. The finish is on the Piazza del Campo, after a steep and narrow climb on the roughly-paved Via Santa Caterina leading {{into the center of}} the medieval city.|$|R

50|$|The coaster’s {{track is}} {{essentially}} a large U shape that is loaded at the base and uses a series of LIMs to accelerate the train up {{each side of the}} track. One side of the <b>track</b> is <b>twisted</b> <b>track</b> (commonly called an inline twist) that ends in a straight section angled at about 45 degrees, the other side is a perfectly vertical straight track. The train seats 28 riders in a standard overhead suspended design.|$|R
50|$|A {{butterfly}} inversion {{is sometimes}} found on Vekoma roller coasters. A butterfly begins {{like a normal}} loop, but as the track goes up it twists 45 degrees to {{one side or the}} other, and then when it is headed down the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> back. The maneuver is then repeated but in reverse. It is essentially the same in construction as a batwing / boomerang, however the coaster exits the element traveling {{in the same direction as}} it began. An example of this is found on Goudurix in Parc Astérix in Plailly, France, or Blue Hawk at Six Flags Over Georgia.|$|R

50|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, the two <b>tracks</b> of <b>Twisted</b> Twins {{were rated}} separately. Both rides peaked in their debut year at positions 41 and 37, respectively. Despite the rides having different rankings throughout their lifetime, {{they both have}} an average ranking of 107.|$|R
50|$|Dutch {{roller coaster}} {{manufacturer}} Vekoma constructed the first large-scale flying roller coaster, Stealth, for California's Great America in 2000. Nicknamed the 'Flying Dutchman' by Vekoma, Stealth featured a higher-capacity train with four-across seating. Riders load the trains in an upright sitting position, facing {{the rear of}} the train. After the train is fully loaded, a mechanism in the station lower the seats to the track, with the riders on their backs facing the ceiling. After cresting the lift hill, the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> 180 degrees to flip the riders into the flying position {{for the rest of the}} ride. Just prior to reaching the roller coaster's final brake run, the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> again, such that riders are lying on their backs facing upward. After reaching the station, the seats are raised back to loading position.The harness system for the Vekoma flying roller coaster consists of two main elements: the lap bar and the chest harness. After being seated, the operator pulls down the lap bar, which is hinged on the floor of the train. The bar locks into slots in the sides of the seat and secures the waist. Halfway up the bar is a pair of leg restraints, which hold the legs in place during the ride. The rider then fastens the buckles to close the chest harness and secure the upper body. Hand grips are placed at the ends of the arm rests of each seat.Vekoma would expand upon the 'Flying Dutchman' prototype with two other installations in 2001, Batwing for Six Flags America and X-Flight for Geauga Lake. Of the three Vekoma Flying Dutchmans, only Batwing still operates at its original location: X-Flight now operates at Kings Island as Firehawk, while Stealth was relocated to Carowinds and renamed BORG Assimilator from 2004 to 2007, and now operates as Nighthawk.|$|R
500|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the train enters the launch area. To {{the left of}} the launch area is a [...] "Christmas tree" [...] light, similar to those {{employed}} at the starting line of a drag strip. A brief message is played to the riders to: [...] "keep arms down, head back, and hold on." [...] Once the train is prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. It then launches, accelerating to a speed of [...] in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the train begins its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees clockwise before climbing over the [...] top hat. Upon descending, the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes.|$|R
50|$|After loading {{into your}} train, in an African themed station, the ride {{propelled}} you outward into a 167 degree right {{turn to the}} lift hill. The lift hill was unusual, as it spiraled in an upward, left-handed helix, rather than the typical straight section found on most roller coasters. At {{the top of the}} lift was a drop past the exit station and storage tracks, followed by another climb upward into a swooping left turn, sending you back toward the lift hill for a fly-by. A steep drop to the left sent you into the thick of the forest, as the <b>track</b> <b>twisted</b> upward again past the Worlds of Fun Railroad trestle. A short drop and hop up into the start of a large sweeping 730 degree series of spiral left turns. The ride gave you brief last breath before being plunged into a seemingly endless underground tunnel, before being hurled out, up, and onto the brakes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Foolin'" [...] was {{released}} as the album's second single. The <b>track</b> features Lil <b>Twist</b> and {{was released}} on 17 June 2011. It did well in Bulgaria, reaching 8 in the top 40.|$|R
50|$|Despite failing at the <b>track</b> twice, <b>Twist</b> Magic again {{ran in the}} Champion Chase at Cheltenham, but was unruly in {{the parade}} and {{unseated}} Sam Thomas, then fell at the fourth last fence as Master Minded recorded his second win in the race. He then bounced back to form at Sandown in the Celebration Chase, which he won by ten lengths from Arkle second Kalahari King.|$|R

The train captures video footage from the front and rear power cars, and video of the pantograph and wheel interfaces.|$|R
60|$|The sun had set when Walthew {{urged his}} {{worn-out}} mule up a narrow <b>track</b> that <b>twisted</b> along the hillside through thick timber. The evening was very dark, and thin mist drifted among the giant trees. Creepers streamed {{down from their}} interlacing boughs, damp brush projected {{from the sides of}} the trail, and Walthew growled savagely when he was buffeted by clusters of dewy leaves. His head ached, the perspiration dripped from his hot face, and he was sore in every limb, while he found the steamy atmosphere almost unbreathable.|$|R
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{begins in the}} station, which is built {{to look like a}} {{partially}} destroyed church, and climbs up a [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the <b>track</b> <b>twists</b> 180 degrees anticlockwise, so that riders are upside down, before plunging down the world's first dive drop element.

This is followed by a corkscrew, which passes through the inclined loop. Upon leaving the corkscrew, the train curves past a crashed fire engine with water and fire effects and proceeds through a keyhole: a partly destroyed church tower. The ride then flies over the station and enters into a last inline twist before a mid-course brake run. Following this, the train makes a banked left-hand turn into the final brakes. The train then goes back into the station. The ride previously featured an on-ride video camera, filming riders and allowing the purchase of a DVD afterwards; this was removed sometime in 2016.|$|R
