5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} caisson or a {{mine that}} has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> their spacesuit is lower than <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle.

40|$|Structural grids (grid metastructures) {{supporting}} discrete pressure waves {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> waves <b>in</b> continuous media are considered. The grids consist of links capable of transmitting longitudinal pressure waves and nodes providing equal <b>pressures</b> on <b>the</b> ends of outgoing links. <b>The</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nodes {{are governed by}} finite-difference equations approximating, under certain conditions, the wave equation in free space. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nodes {{are determined by the}} acoustic velocities and impedances of links rather than by the coordinates of the nodes and the link lengths. Therefore, a grid approximating <b>pressure</b> waves <b>in</b> a region of uniform homogeneous space can be replaced by an equivalent “deformed” grid with other spatial coordinates of nodes but <b>the</b> same <b>pressure</b> waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nodes. In particular, a locally “stretched” equivalent grid can be found that, theoretically, provides a sufficiently large region free from nodes and links. This property makes it possible to use these grids to construct ultrabroadband acoustic cloaks...|$|R

5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU.

The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum.

5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the chest is compressing the airways at this time.

Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the lead-up {{was further}} {{compounded}} by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200m freestyle {{would be one of}} the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as The Race of the Century. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events. Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26s in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E
