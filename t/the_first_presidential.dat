5|$|Following the {{donation}} {{of his home}} {{to the state of}} Ohio for the Spiegel Grove State Park, he was re-interred there in 1915. The following year the Hayes Commemorative Library and Museum, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> library in the United States, was opened on the site, funded by contributions from the state of Ohio and Hayes' family.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> {{term and}} the first vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by the Congress of the Confederation for the {{beginning}} of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to a delay in the counting and certification of the electoral votes, which was not done until April 6 (because although the Senate of the 1st Congress initially convened on March 4, it did not achieve a quorum until April 6, and so could not conduct business), they commenced several weeks late. Adams first presided over the Senate on April 21. Washington was inaugurated into office on April 30.|$|E
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds. When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> {{term and}} the first vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by the Congress of the Confederation for the {{beginning}} of operations of the federal government under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to the formidable difficulties of long-distance travel in 18th century America, they did not commence until several weeks later. Although the House of Representatives and the Senate convened on the prescribed date, both soon adjourned due to lack of a quorum. As a result, the presidential electoral votes could not be counted or certified. On April 1, the House convened with a quorum present for the first time, and the representatives began their work. The Senate first achieved a quorum on April 6. That is the date upon which the electoral votes were counted.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{took control}} of most major {{newspapers}} by either buying a controlling stake in them, or by forcing them to shut down. The government also harassed, intimidated, or exiled individual journalists and editors. The newspaper La Prensa, which remained independent and was frequently critical of Noriega, had its staff intimidated and its offices damaged; eventually, it too was forced to close. In May 1984, Noriega allowed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> elections in 16 years. Noriega and Díaz Herrera picked Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino to be the PRD's candidate, {{with the intention of}} keeping him under close control. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, {{on his way to a}} landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the last}} time a Republican {{candidate}} won an electoral vote in the region of New England until 2016, with Donald Trump winning the 2nd Congressional District of Maine.

Likewise, this was also <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> election that Delaware and Pennsylvania, would fail to vote for the wining candidate since 1948, and 1968, with California, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, and New Jersey all failing to do the same since 1976 respectively as well. This was also <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>presidential</b> election since Jimmy Carter's narrow victory in 1976, that a presidential candidate from either party would win a presidential election with fewer than 300 electoral votes, and the first time a Republican would win without breaking that amount since William McKinley's victory in 1900.|$|E
