40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{over the}} South China Sea (SCS) {{during the period}} of 1997 - 2006 are {{analyzed}} using the Tropical Storm and Hurricane WX products. A total of 158 <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> were formed over the SCS from 1997 to 2006, with 54 developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> which developed into tropical depressions and 104 non-developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> which never developed into tropical depressions. The development rate of <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> into <b>tropical</b> depressions was 34. 18 % in these ten years. During the period of this study, total annual numbers of <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> over the SCS had significant decreasing trends; however, the development rate of <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> had an insignificant increasing trend. © 2011 Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe development of <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> into <b>tropical</b> cyclones {{is not well}} understood. The lack of data on developing and non-developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> makes theoretical models difficult to test empirically. This thesis will investigate thermodynamic parameters and kinematic flow structures found in three <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> investigated in the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud-Systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) Experiment. Two of the <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> did not develop into tropical storms, {{and one of the}} <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> was immediately classified as a tropical storm after the first research flight was conducted on the system. The presence of significant convective available potential energy (CAPE) and low convective inhibition (CIN) has been universally found {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> studied in this thesis and other recent PREDICT studies, such as Observations of the Convective Environment in Developing and Non-Developing <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbances</b> by Roger K. Smith and Michael T. Montgomery published in 2012 by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society. The main difference between developing and non-developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> appears to lie with the kinematic flow boundary structure and thermodynamic properties hypothesized in the marsupial paradigm.

5|$|A <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> formed near Diego Garcia on April3 and {{subsequently}} moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened {{upon entering the}} Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country and quickly weakened into a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance.</b> After emerging into the Indian Ocean off {{the east coast of}} Madagascar, the system re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on April16.|$|E

30|$|The {{simulated}} {{decreases in}} cloud cover and precipitation coupled with increased aerosols over the Indian Ocean and Asian monsoon regions were symmetric {{with respect to}} the equator (Figs.  7 e, f and 10 a). The spatial pattern of this symmetrical response along 10 ° S and 10 ° N over the Indian Ocean corresponded to that of the activity of cyclone pairs that are symmetrical {{with respect to the}} equator (e.g., Kiladis and Wheeler 1995; Compo et al. 1999; Ito and Satomura 2009, Takahashi et al. 2011). The activity of cyclone pairs is dominant in this season. This correspondence suggests that modulation of the activity of the <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> may explain the decrease in cloud cover and precipitation. The decrease in precipitable water (Fig.  7 g) due to cooling of the SAT (Fig.  7 b) and anomalous descending motions (Fig.  9 a, c) can weaken the low-level convergence of water vapor and/or the activity of the <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> over the equatorial Indian Ocean. Notably, the signals were clear along the major route of the <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances.</b> These characteristics were common to both boreal summer and winter, although the frequent passage routes of <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> are different between boreal summer and winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} weak <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and depressions {{were also}} monitored by RSMC Nadi, however {{all of these}} systems were either short lived or did not develop significantly.|$|R
5|$|A <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> is MFR's {{generic term}} for a non-frontal area of low {{pressure}} that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots (50km/h, 32mph).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E
5|$|During {{the season}} at least 16 {{people were killed}} from {{tropical}} disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004USD; $ USD). The most damaging <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As {{a result of the}} impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the named storms, the MFR tracked seven <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and two <b>tropical</b> depressions throughout the year. Most were short lived, often receiving few warnings. The first two systems developed before Tropical Storm Antoinette in October.|$|R
50|$|The central Pacific used {{names and}} {{numbers from the}} west Pacific's typhoon name list. No storms formed in the region, and thus no names were used. However, <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> that later became typhoons started forming in this area.|$|R

5|$|A <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{formed in}} late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well {{southwest}} of Hawaii. Although the waters were very warm, some dry air was located {{north of the}} system. It slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day as the circulation became exposed.|$|E
5|$|A <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec became better {{organized}} on June 29 and became a tropical depression. Strengthening was very limited as the depression was approaching to land. It made landfall later that day very near of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. As it continued its west-northwest track, it dissipated inland after bringing torrential rains.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a low pressure area, it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains across those islands.|$|E
30|$|The Asian monsoon {{system is}} {{characterized}} by a seasonal cycle of convective activity and atmospheric circulations (e.g., Murakami and Matsumoto 1994). The variability of the monsoon system’s effects on weather and climate over Asia is largely achieved through local convective activities. This variability is also affected by synoptic scale <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances.</b> For example, the monsoon onset is often triggered by <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> or ISO. Recently, global climate modeling has made advances in many aspects of Asian summer monsoon simulations (Sperber et al. 2013; Ogata et al. 2014; Lee and Wang 2014). However, numerical representations of the seasonal transition of the monsoon, such as the monsoon onset, with scale interactions remain challenging. Meanwhile, NICAM has shown an advantage over conventional GCMs in simulating <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances,</b> such as TCs (Fudeyasu et al. 2008; Taniguchi et al. 2010; Nakano et al. 2015) and MJO (Miura et al. 2007 a; Miyakawa et al. 2014). Under Field 3 of SPIRE, we investigated the seasonal transition of the monsoon and anticipated a potential extension of its predictability using a large number of ensemble NICAM simulations, in contrast to previous studies that used simulations of only a single or a few members.|$|R
30|$|The {{detailed}} spatial {{patterns of}} the decrease in precipitation over the Asian monsoon region were simulated. Interestingly, a decrease in precipitation was found along the major routes of the convectively coupled <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> in both boreal summer and winter, although the routes vary seasonally.|$|R
50|$|During the 2000s, {{activity}} was generally below {{the long term}} average, with 60 tropical cyclones developing out of 160 <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and <b>tropical</b> depressions. However activity during the 2002-03, 2004-05 and 2009-10 seasons all experienced activity, near the long term average of about 8 - 9 tropical cyclones.|$|R
5|$|In November, rapidly {{weakening}} Tropical Cyclone Alison {{moved from}} the Australian basin and dissipated immediately upon entering the south-west Indian Ocean on November13. On December4, short-lived <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> A3 was classified by MFR, subsequently drifting into the Australian region. Possibly related to the previous system, Tropical Cyclone Cathy {{moved from the}} Australian basin into the basin on December28, quickly dissipating.|$|E
5|$|On February5, a {{tropical}} low {{developed in the}} Mozambique Channel. Classified as Tropical Disturbance9 by MFR, the system moved southeastward, dissipating on February6. The season ended with a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance,</b> which formed on June13 to the east-southeast of Diego Garcia. It moved to the south, and was last monitored on June15.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> formed {{within the}} Fijian Archipelago and was {{designated}} as <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> 12F. The {{next day it}} was upgraded to a tropical depression, whilst on January 27, RSMC Nadi named the depression as Cyclone Gene. Later that day Gene made landfall on Fiji, and caused 8 deaths and $51 million (2008, F$). Cyclone Gene then slowly intensified to a category three cyclone on both the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale and the Australian Cyclone Intensity Scale. Gene then took a turn to the south moving towards 25°S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility with the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. Gene then crossed 25°S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory. Cyclone Gene continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone. Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone Gene as they declared it as extratropical.|$|E
50|$|The wet {{season of}} the {{tropical}} marine climate occurs during the period when {{the conditions of the}} atmosphere are not stable. At this time, the regions (10° to 20° north or south of the equator) experience <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Around this time islands like Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada are affected by the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone). Most rain falls between July and September.|$|R
5000|$|The {{season began}} on June 1, {{which was the}} date when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{activated}} radar stations across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The season ended on November 30, which ended the conventional delimitation of the time period when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. At {{the end of the}} season, NHC director Gordon Dunn retired and was replaced by Robert Simpson. For the first time in 1967, the NHC tracked weaker, developing <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances,</b> observing that 90% of systems do not develop. Tropical cyclogenesis [...] - [...] the process in which a tropical cyclone develops [...] - [...] resulted mainly from tropical waves, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and decaying frontal systems. There were 30 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa at Dakar, Senegal, of which 14 became tropical depressions. Another 20 <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> originated offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, and 7 disturbances derived from cold-core lows.|$|R
50|$|Within this basin, <b>tropical</b> and {{subtropical}} <b>disturbances</b> are officially {{monitored by}} the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre on Réunion island, while the Mauritius and Madagascar weather services assign names to significant <b>tropical</b> and subtropical <b>disturbances.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> 08F developed {{within a}} convergence zone about 325km (200mi) {{to the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple of days, and was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical windshear, but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical windshear over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was then last noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season {{originated}} from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001. Moving southwestward, it slowly organized, with convection developing around a weak circulation. Late on October3, MFR classified {{the system as a}} zone of disturbed weather. On October5, the agency re-classified it as a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> and later as Tropical Depression 1. The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear, although it had good outflow. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600UTC on October6, estimating winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Due to the shear, the convection gradually diminished, prompting the MFR to downgrade it to a <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbance</b> on October7. The next day, the JTWC issued its last advisory, noting that the system was dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The first {{system of}} the season proper {{originated}} out of an area of convection in early September in the northeast portion of the basin. On September3, the MFR initiated advisories on <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> A1 about 1435km (890mi) east of Diego Garcia. The system tracked westward, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on September4. Failing to intensify beyond winds of 45km/h (30mph), the disturbance dissipated on September6. Later in the month, <b>Tropical</b> <b>Disturbance</b> A2 formed in a similar region within the monsoon trough, with the MFR initiating advisories on September29. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02S. That day, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status, although strong wind shear prevented intensification. The MFR quickly discontinued advisories, but the JTWC continued tracking it, again upgrading the system to tropical storm status on October1. After the shear again increased, the storm weakened, dissipating on October2.|$|E
50|$|Without a {{pronounced}} dry season, precipitation is distributed fairly well {{throughout the year}} becoming wetter {{in the last quarter}} into the early months of the first quarter, when <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> and monsoon winds especially the Northeast Monsoon (Amihan) bring in heavy rains. Other months are characterized by short periods of dryer days and fine weather, except in July and August when the dry and gusty northwest monsoon winds intensify.|$|R
5000|$|TUTTs {{sometimes}} {{brings a}} large amount of vertical wind shear over <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the deep tropics and cyclones and thus hinder their development. [...] However, there are cases that TUTTs assist the genesis and intensification of tropical cyclones by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere. [...] This is most likely near its most westward and equatorward periphery.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{physical}} processes associated with early-stage tropical cyclone develop-ment vs. non-development, composite and individual case analyses {{were made of}} US Air Force northwestern Pacific 950 mb ("' 1500 feet) aircraft "investigative " reconnaissance flights into <b>tropical</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Analysis of a 7 -year period provided about 100 cases of development vs. 100 cases of non-development. Significantly higher radial inflow was observed in the inner-core of developing cases as compared to non-developing cases. Only minimal tangential winds and sea-level pressure differences were observed between devel-oping and non-developing cases. Many formation cases had strong "packets " of radial momentum surges to inner-core radii at selective azimuthal locations. These wind surges were related to satellite-observed concentrations of deep convection near the inner-core of the developing disturbances {{and appeared to be}} environmentally induced. Another factor influencing tropical cyclone genesis was the strength of a disturbance's upper-tropospheric (250 mb) relative wind "blowthrough " or ventilation.
