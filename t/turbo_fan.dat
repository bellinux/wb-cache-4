40|$|AbstractContinuous {{increase}} in flight passengers alongside {{with a high}} demand for fuel efficiency {{has led to the}} development of Geared <b>Turbo</b> <b>Fans</b> (GTF). Being a safety-critical part, the gearbox faces strong safety requirements that also account for sophisticated manufacturing processes and monitoring systems. One major issue is tool wear and the threat of tool breakage during the hobbing process. Due to the high costs of both the raw material and the tool, wear induced tool breakage is a major cost driver. Common practice today is to use each tool for a designated time, but in-situ online wear assessment would result in a major reduction of costs. Tool wear of hobs is not spread equally across all cutting edges; hence the assignment of tool wear to each blade would enable a monitoring system to analyze the individual tool life and predict its operational capability. This research paper discusses the general feasibility of a blade-oriented monitoring system for gear hobbing processes. A correlation between tool wear and effective power is found and analyzed. It can be shown that the respective position of the tool wear changes the effective power signal significantly. These findings enable further research on an online, model based and position-oriented tool wear monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|Die effiziente Berechnung der Schallemission moderner Flugzeugtriebwerke unter realistischen Betriebsbedingungen ist erst durch die Kopplung verschiedener numerischer Verfahren möglich. Die physikalisch/mathematisch korrekte, algorithmisch effiziente und für den Anwender bequeme Umsetzung der Kopplung der verschiedenen Berechnungsmethoden ist letztendlich maßgebend für deren Einsatz im industriellen Auslegungsprozess eines Flugtriebwerks. In dieser Arbeit werden unterschiedliche Ansätze zur Kopplung der verschiedenen Berechnungsverfahren dargestellt, gegen experimentelle Ergebnisse validiert und es werden Empfehlungen zu deren Anwendung gegeben. Gegenstand des anwendungsorientierten Teils der Untersuchung sind zwei skalierte Turbofantestaufbauten und ein generischer offener gegenläufiger Rotor. Die konkrete Kopplungsstrategie orientiert sich an den strömungsmechanischen Eigenheiten der verschiedenen Anwendungsfälle. In dieser Arbeit werden drei Ansätze zur Kopplung untersucht: Die direkte Interpolation der Schwankungsgrößen aus dem CFD- in das CAA-Gebiet für die zuströmseitige Schallausbreitung beim Turbofan. Die Rekonstruktion der akustischen Schwankungen im CAA-Gebiet anhand der Ergebnisse der CFD-Simulation unter Verwendung eines analytischen Modells für die abströmseitige Schallausbreitung beim Turbofan. Die Projektion der Schwankungsgrößen aus dem CFD-Gebiet zu beliebigen Beobachterpositionen durch Anwendung eines FW-H-Ansatzes für den Fall eines offenen gegenläufigen Rotors. Es wird gezeigt, dass bei Berücksichtigung der Eigenheiten der verschiedenen Verfahren und dementsprechend sorgfältiger Auslegung der Rechengitter die absoluten Schallpegel mit einer Genauigkeit von 1 - 2 ~dB wiedergegeben werden können. Die benötigten Ressourcen, in erster Linie Bearbeitungszeit und Rechenzeit auf einem Computercluster, sind gegenüber dem Ressourcenverbrauch eines experimentellen Vorgehens erheblich reduziert. Die vorgestellten Ansätze zur Kopplung der verschiedenen numerischen Verfahren wurden in dem Programmpaket Connect 3 D umgesetzt. Dieses ist in der Programmiersprache C++ implementiert, wobei ein stark modularer Ansatz verfolgt wird. Auf diese Weise ist es möglich die Ansprüche an Robustheit, Wartbarkeit und Erweiterbarkeit, welche eine praxisnahe Anwendung mit sich bringt, langfristig zu erfüllen. The {{efficient}} {{prediction of}} the noise emission of modern aircraft engines is enabled only by the coupling of different numerical approaches. For a hybrid method to be useful in the industrial design process it is important, that first the implementation is valid from a physical and mathematical point of view, second it is efficient from a algorithmic {{point of view and}} last but not least it's application should be comfortable for the user. The scope of this thesis is to describe approaches to couple the different numerical tools. The final hybrid process chain is validated against experimental data and some advise will be given for the correct application of the hybrid method. The focus of the application oriented part of the thesis are two scaled <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> test rigs and one generic contra rotating open rotor. The particular approach to couple the different numerical tools is oriented at the flow features of the specific application. Three different coupling approaches are given in further detail: First, to compute the sound field upstream of a ducted <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> the perturbation variables are interpolated from the CFD-domain to the CAA-domain. Second, to compute the sound field downstream of a ducted <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> the acoustic perturbation variables will be reconstructed in the CAA-domain based on an analytical model which is calibrated with the source information from the CFD-domain. Third, to compute the far field pressure of a contra rotating open rotor a dedicated FW-H approach is used. It benefits from the tonal and axisymmetric nature of the problem. It is shown that the measured sound pressure levels can be reproduced with an accuracy of 1 - 2 dB if the characteristic features of each method are considered and a careful design of each computational mesh is done. The different coupling approaches are implemented in the program package Connect 3 D, which is implemented in C++ with extensive use of methods from the field of modern software engineering. Thus it is possible to cope with the different demands that come along with an application oriented software development on a long term perspective.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an engine sizing and cycle selection study of ultra high bypass ratio engines {{applied to a}} subsonic commercial aircraft in the N+ 2 (2020) timeframe. NASA has created the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project {{to serve as a}} technology transition bridge between fundamen-tal research (TRL 1 - 4) and potential users (TRL 7). Specifi-cally, ERA is focused on subsonic transport technologies that could reach TRL 6 by 2020 and are capable of integration into an advanced vehicle concept that simultaneously meets the ERA project metrics for noise, emissions, and fuel burn. An important variable in exploring the trade space is the selection of the opti-mal engine cycle for use on the advanced aircraft. In this paper, two specific ultra high bypass engine cycle options will be ex-plored: advanced direct drive and geared turbofan. The advanced direct drive turbofan is an improved version of conventional tur-bofans. In terms of both bypass ratio and overall pressure ratio, the advanced direct turbofan benefits from improvements in aero-dynamic design of its components, as well as material stress and temperature properties. By putting a gear between the fan and the low pressure turbine,a geared <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> allows both compo-nents to operate at optimal speeds,thus further improving over-all cycle efficiency relative to a conventional turbofan. In this study, sensitivity of cycle design with level of technology will be explored, in terms of both cycle parameters (such as specific thrust consumption (TSFC) and bypass ratio) and aircraft mis-sion parameters (such as fuel burn and noise). To demonstrate this sensitivity,engines will be sized for optimal performance on a 300 passenger class aircraft for a 2010 level technology tube and wing airframe, a N+ 2 level technology tube and wing air-frame,and finally on a N+ 2 level technology blended wing body airframe with and without boundary layer ingestion (BLI) en-gines...|$|E

Major part of the report covers detailed mechanical design of the drive turbine and the other rig systems. The test rig is designed and developed at Propulsion Division, NAL-CSIR to map the electrical characteristics of the AC alternator {{to be used in}} a Small <b>Turbo</b> <b>Fan</b> Engine (STFE) which is being developed by Gas Turbine Research Establishment. An air turbine drive was designed to develop 20 kW power at 53000 rpm to drive the alternator. A parabolic solid disc configuration is arrived at to keep the stress minimum. Cyclic symmetry stress analysis is carried out on the sector model (1 / 27 th) carved out from the blisk. The air turbine shaft is designed to be inserted in to the bore of the alternator hallow shaft and is to be fastened at the other end with a lock nut. The rotor-dynamic analysis is carried out for the rotor in overhang configuration with bearing support stiffness ranging from 17. 5 to 175 MN/m and critical speeds of the rotor-bearing system is predicted. A lubrication system with an in-built reservoir tank is designed to provide cooling to the stator core and to lubricate the alternator bearings.

40|$|The current {{fleet of}} large {{commercial}} aircraft has successfully achieved FAA noise certifications because of, in part, the successful application of uniform passive duct liner treatments to control engine system noise. One goal of NASA's engine system noise reduction {{program is to}} develop technologies to improve the sound absorbing properties of duct liner treatments so that they remain effective in modern <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> engines. One such technology being studied is checkerboard or periodic axially and circumferentially segmented liners. A preliminary assessment of the potential of this technology was conducted by applying uncertainties associated with manufacturing, installation, source structure, and tonal frequency to a liner developed using deterministic design methods and generating a measure of improvement {{with respect to a}} uniform liner subjected to the same uncertainties. Deterministic design and analysis of the candidate checkerboard liner showed that it obtains a 1. 5 dB per duct aspect ratio improvement in liner attenuation over a similarly designed uniform liner. When uncertainties in liner impedances, source structure, and frequency are considered, the performance of the checkerboard liner drops off dramatically. The final results of this paper show that the candidate checkerboard liner has a less than 25 percent chance of outperforming the uniform liner when moderate levels of uncertainty are considered. It {{is important to note that}} this study did not include the effects of mean flow on liner performance and, more important to note, that as a gradient based optimization process was used to design the checkerboard liner, it is almost certain that a global optimal design was not found for the candidate checkerboard liner.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} the large potential for hybrid active-passive systems for attenuating interior noise in aircraft fuselages. The main {{advantage of an}} active-passive system is, by utilizing the natural dynamics of the actuator system, the control actuator power and weight is markedly reduced and stability/robustness is enhanced. Three different active-passive approaches were studied in the past year. The first technique utilizes multiple tunable vibration absorbers (ATVA) for reducing narrow band sound radiated from panels and transmitted through fuselage structures. The focus is on reducing interior noise due to propeller or <b>turbo</b> <b>fan</b> harmonic excitation. Two types of tunable vibration absorbers were investigated; a solid state system based upon a piezoelectric mechanical exciter and an electromechanical system based upon a Motran shaker. Both of these systems utilize a mass-spring dynamic effect to maximize tile output force near resonance of the shaker system and so {{can also be used}} as vibration absorbers. The dynamic properties of the absorbers (i. e. resonance frequency) were modified using a feedback signal from an accelerometer mounted on the active mass, passed through a compensator and fed into the drive component of the shaker system (piezoelectric element or voice coil respectively). The feedback loop consisted of a two coefficient FIR filter, implemented on a DSP, where the input is acceleration of tile ATVA mass and the output is a force acting in parallel with the stiffness of the absorber. By separating the feedback signal into real and imaginary components, the effective natural frequency and damping of the ATVA can be altered independently. This approach gave control of the resonance frequencies while also allowing the simultaneous removal of damping from the ATVA, thus increasing the ease of controllability and effectiveness. In order to obtain a "tuned" vibration absorber the chosen resonant frequency was set to the excitation frequency. In order to minimize sound radiation a gradient descent algorithm was developed which globally adapted the resonance frequencies of multiple ATVA's while minimizing a cost based upon the radiated sound power or sound energy obtained from an array of microphones...|$|E
