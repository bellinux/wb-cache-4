40|$|The Border {{between the}} United States (U. S.) and Mexico spans {{approximately}} 2, 000 miles, from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. The area {{is subjected to}} a unique blend of increased industrial development (especially on the Mexico side of the border), intense pressures because of the shifting and growing population related to this development, and an arid climate that can exacerbate many air quality problems. Ozone and particulate matter are air pollutants of particular concern. Ground-level ozone is harmful to both {{human health and the}} environment (see Indicator 004). Although some industrial sources release ozone directly into the environment, most ground-level ozone forms from chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and sunlight. Ozone levels are typically highest during the afternoon hours of the summer months, when the influence of direct sunlight is the greatest (EPA, 2003). Inhalation exposure to ozone has been linked to numerous respiratory health effects, including decreases in lung function, airway inflammation, and cough and pain when <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> Ozone exposure can aggravate lung diseases such as asthma, leading to increased medication use and increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits. Though people with respiratory problems are most vulnerable to ozone, even healthy people who are active outdoors can suffer from ozone-related health effects. Elevated concentrations of ozone can also affect vegetation an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High {{levels of}} exhaled carbon {{monoxide}} (eCO) are {{a marker of}} airway or lung inflammation. We investigated whether hypo- or hyperventilation can affect measured values. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were trained to achieve sustained end-tidal CO 2 (etCO 2) concentrations of 30 (hyperventilation), 40 (normoventilation), and 50 mmHg (hypoventilation). As soon as target etCO 2 values were achieved for 120 sec, exhaled breath was analyzed for eCO with a photoacoustic spectrometer. At etCO 2 values of 30 and 40 mmHg exhaled breath was sampled both after <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inspiration and after a normal one. All measurements were performed in two different environmental conditions: A) ambient CO concentration = 0. 8 ppm and B) ambient CO concentration = 1. 7 ppm. Results During normoventilation, eCO mean (standard deviation) was 11. 5 (0. 8) ppm; it decreased to 10. 3 (0. 8) ppm during hyperventilation (p 2 changes (hyperventilation: 10 % Vs 25 % decrease; hypoventilation 3 % Vs 25 % increase). <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inspiration before <b>breath</b> sampling was associated with lower eCO values (p Conclusions eCO measurements should not be performed during marked acute hyperventilation, like that induced in this study, but the influence of less pronounced hyperventilation or of hypoventilation is probably negligible in clinical practice</p...|$|R
40|$|A {{human brain}} is capable to achieve great things, to endure heavy stress and to {{calculate}} complex problems. What happens when {{it fails to}} do so? Is there {{anything that could be}} done to prevent this from happening? Is it possible to help a pilot in command manage his or her stress during flight by measuring finger temperature, skin conductance, ECG and heart rate variations? This thesis study processes that can help pilots manage high stress with simple tools such as closing their eyes and <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> few <b>deep</b> <b>breaths.</b> To determine when the calming measures are needed and to evaluate potential effects, all the signal data stated above are used combined with scoring of every participant performance. The statistical methods used involves an ANOVA-test and mean value calculations. The results were also analyzed using CBR to get {{a better understanding of the}} results and to not only rely on statistical methods. The thesis is limited to a minor study of 10 student pilots participating in two sessions with a heavy workload departure in a simulator. The test did result in a small difference between the two sessions which pointed at the calming measures giving a slight improvement for the pilots. However, when ANOVA was applied it showed that the difference between the two sessions was not a significant one. This could be due to several reasons; the pilots were not used to the calming measures and because of this felt more stressed when trying to use the calming measures as well. There might have been a difference if calming measures were included into pilot training already from the beginning. Another reason might be because this is only a minor study and the difference was not apparent on so few participants. In future research, however, there might be a breakthrough on how to handle stress in a cockpit environment involving similar sensors...|$|R

He looked in at his own door; the furniture seemed stiffer than usual and the tick of the clock more deliberate.

6000|$|Above {{him was a}} limb that ordinarily {{he could}} have leaped for and reached with ease; but weak from his wounds and loss of blood he doubted his ability to do so now. There was even a {{question}} as to whether {{he would be able to}} ascend the tree at all. There was just one chance: the lowest branch left the bole within easy reach of a man standing on the ground close to the tree's stem, but to reach a position where the branch would be accessible he must step over the body of a lion. <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> he placed one foot between the sprawled legs of the beast and gingerly raised the other to plant it upon the opposite side of the tawny body. [...] "What," [...] he thought, [...] "if the beggar should happen to wake now?" [...] The suggestion sent a shudder through his frame but he did not hesitate or withdraw his foot. Gingerly he planted it beyond the lion, threw his weight forward upon it and cautiously brought his other foot to the side of the first. He had passed and the lion had not awakened.|$|E

Distrust of doctors did not prevent him having ten minutes every morning with the old {{practitioner}} who had treated Gyp for mumps, measles, and the other blessings of childhood. The old fellow--his name was Rivershaw--was a most peculiar survival. He smelled of mackintosh, had round purplish cheeks, a rim of hair which people said he dyed, and bulging grey eyes slightly bloodshot. He was short in body and wind, drank port wine, was suspected of taking snuff, read The Times, spoke always in a husky voice, and used a very small brougham with a very old black horse. But he had a certain low cunning, which had defeated many ailments, and his reputation for assisting people into the world stood extremely high. Every morning punctually at twelve, the crunch of his little brougham's wheels would be heard.

One they called Cordy--he shore did get offensive. He's the four-flush, loud kind. I didn't want to make any trouble for the girl Ruby--thet's her name--so I was mighty good-natured.... I dropped in Stanton's to-day. Ruby spotted me fust off, an' SHE asked me to dance. Shore I'm no dandy dancer, but I tried to learn. We was gettin' along {{powerful}} nice when in comes Cordy, hoppin' mad. He had a feller with him. An' both had been triflin' with red liquor. You oughter seen the crowd get back. Made me think Cordy an' his pard had blowed a lot round heah an' got a rep. Wal, I knowed they was bluff. Jest mean, ugly four-flushers. Shore they didn't an' couldn't know nothin' of me. I reckon I was only thet long-legged, red-headed galoot from Texas. Anyhow, I was made to understand it might get hot sudden-like if I didn't clear out. I left it to the girl. An' some of them girls is full of hell. Ruby jest stood there scornful an' sassy, with her haid leanin' to one side, her eyes half-shut, an' a little smile on her face. I'd call her more 'n hell. A nice girl gone wrong. Them kind shore is the dangerest.... Wal, she says: 'Reddy, are you goin' to let them run you out of heah? They haven't any strings on me.' So I slapped Cordy's face an' told him to shut up. He let out a roar an' got wild with his hands, like them four-flush fellers do who wants to look real bad. I says, pretty sharplike, 'Don't make any moves now!' An' the darned fool went fer his gun!... Wal, I caught his hand, twisted the gun away from him, poked him in the ribs with it, an' then shoved it back in his belt. He was crazy, but pretty pale an' surprised. Shore I acted sudden-like.
