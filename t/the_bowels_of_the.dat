5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view.

Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGut {{microbiota}} {{contains about}} 10 (14) bacterial cells classified within 4 bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{information has been}} generated through <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> nucleic acid-based methodologies (16 S rRNA) which provide a cornerstone of microbial taxonomy. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a dysregulated immune response to the gut microbiota in genetically predisposed hosts. Experimental animal models <b>of</b> colitis provide <b>the</b> best evidence that bacteria present in <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals have {{an essential role in}} <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> colitis since in most models, germ-free animals do not develop disease. Moreover, in the immunodeficient mouse model of colitis called TRUC (T-bet-/- x RAG 2 -/-), a colitogenic gut microbiota is selected and can be transmitted to mice with intact immunity and induce colitis. Current interest therefore focuses on the bacterial community as <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> antigens that fuel the chronic inflammation seen in IBD. Dysbiosis, an imbalance between harmful and protective bacteria, has been evoked and investigated in IBD. Thus, besides the classical pathogens, gut microbiota can drive pathogenicity via two mechanisms: an expansion of 'pro-inflammatory' species or a restriction in <b>the</b> protective compounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbiota. Complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbiota suggests that both mechanisms may contribute to chronic gut inflammation in IBD...|$|R

After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freighter.

500|$|Another {{established}} literary trope {{found in}} the plot of Conan the Barbarian {{is the concept of}} death, followed by a journey into the underworld, and rebirth. [...] Donald E. Palumbo, the Language and Humanities Chair at Lorain County Community College, noted that like most other sword and sorcery films, Conan used the motif of underground journeys to reinforce the themes of death and rebirth. [...] According to him, the first scene to involve all three is after Conan's liberation: his flight from wild dogs sends him tumbling into a tomb where he finds a sword that lets him cut off his chains and stand with newfound power. [...] In the later parts of the film, Conan experiences two underground journeys where death abounds: in <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tower of Serpents where he has to fight a giant snake and {{in the depths of the}} Temple of Set where the cultists feast on human flesh while Doom transforms himself into a large serpent. [...] Whereas Valeria dies and comes back from the dead (albeit briefly), Conan's ordeal from his crucifixion was symbolic. [...] Although the barbarian's crucifixion might evoke Christian imagery, associations of the film with the religion are roundly rejected. [...] Milius stated his film is full of pagan ideas, a sentiment supported by film critics such as Elley and Jack Kroll. [...] George Aichele, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at Adrian College, suggested the filmmaker's intent with the crucifixion scene was pure marketing: to tease the audience with religious connotations. [...] He, however, suggested that Conan's story can be viewed as an analogy of Christ's life and vice versa. [...] Nigel Andrews, a film critic, saw any connections to Christianity related more to the making of the film. The crucifixion is also reminiscent of Odin being nailed to Yggdrasil.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar".

He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J.
