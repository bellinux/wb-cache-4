40|$|Food futurists {{accept that}} sustainability-minded {{humanity}} will increasingly incorporate insects as alternative protein. The most studied and easily reared species {{are not necessarily}} the most sustainable, acceptable, or delicious. Here, we review the literature on the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, which is capable of efficiently converting a wide variety of organic materials, from food waste to manure, into insect biomass. They can be grown and harvested without dedicated facilities and are not pestiferous. Their larvae are 42 % crude protein and 29 % fat, although they are higher in saturated fats than most insects. They do not concentrate pesticides or mycotoxins. They are already grown and recommended for use as animal feed, but with regional legal restrictions on how this is done. For commercial use in human foods, larvae could potentially be milled and converted into a <b>textured</b> <b>protein</b> with a strong flavor. Their biggest advantage over other insects is their ability to convert waste into food, generating value and closing nutrient loops as they reduce pollution and costs. This general advantage is also their greatest disadvantage, for the social stigmas and legal prohibitions against eating organisms that eat waste are added to extant taboos facing insect consumption...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential utilization of ostrich meat trimming in hamburger preparation, as well as its physicochemical and sensory characterization. Using ostrich meat trimmings from the legs and neck, four different formulations were prepared with varied amounts of bacon and <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein.</b> Physical analysis of yield, shrinkage percentage, and water retention capacity and chemical analysis of proximate composition, cholesterol levels, and calories were performed. The formulations underwent sensory analysis by 52 potential ostrich meat consumers, who evaluated tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and purchase intent. The formulations containing <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein</b> showed the highest yield, lowest shrinkage percentage, and highest water retention capacity. Lipid content varied from 0. 58 to 4. 99 %; protein from 17. 08 to 21. 37 %; ash from 3. 00 to 3. 62 %; moisture from 73. 87 to 76. 27 %; cholesterol from 22. 54 to 32. 11 mg. 100 g- 1; and calorie from 87. 22 to 163. 42 kcal. 100 g- 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} cashew fiber in combination with <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein</b> for the preparation of vegetable burger. Two treatments were studied to reduce fiber size (mechanical pressing with or without enzymatic maceration) {{and its impact on}} physical chemical characteristics, sensory acceptance and stability of burgers stored at - 18 °C for 180 days. Both burger formulations had high moisture and carbohydrate contents and low lipid contents. Enzymatic fiber maceration resulted in harder products with lower moisture content. During storage, reduction in pH and ascorbic acid and increase in acidity values were observed, with no tendencies for color values. Throughout the storage period, burgers were within microbiological standards of the Brazilian legislation for human consumption and average sensory acceptance was within acceptance zone. It was concluded that the inclusion of enzymatic maceration in the fiber treatment process has no advantages and that burgers elaborated with cashew fiber and <b>textured</b> soybean <b>protein</b> can be consumed up to six months of frozen storage...|$|R
50|$|Extrusion enables mass {{production}} of food via a continuous, efficient system that ensures uniformity {{of the final}} product. Food products manufactured using extrusion usually have a high starch content. These include some pasta, breads (croutons, bread sticks, and flat breads), many breakfast cereals and ready-to-eat snacks, confectionery, pre-made cookie dough, some baby foods, full-fat soy, <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein,</b> some beverages, and dry and semi-moist pet foods.|$|R
50|$|Cold breakfast was {{available}} at the Brownstone. For almost two months everyone had {{to travel to the}} Ark for main meals. There were as many as 225 co-op residents coming to the Ark for dinner. Menus typically consisted of a vegetable, a salad, potatoes or pasta, a meat dish or meat substitute, and a dessert. <b>Textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> (TVP) was introduced as a cost-cutting measure.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their use in livestock feed, soybean products are widely used for human consumption. Common soybean products include soy sauce, soy milk, tofu, soy meal, soy flour, <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> (TVP), tempeh, soy lecithin and soybean oil. Soybeans may also be eaten with minimal processing, for example in the Japanese food edamame (edamame), in which immature soybeans are boiled whole in their pods and served with salt.|$|R
50|$|Other {{unconventional}} ingredients, generally {{used for}} home-made coxinhas made by aficionados, include peas, chopped button mushrooms, palmheart, carrot, cooked and seasoned cashew apples, unripe jackfruit or unripe breadfruit, {{as well as}} whole-wheat flour batter or even a vegetarian version of either <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> (soy meat) or falafel with appropriate seasonings so its taste resembles a traditional coxinha more closely.

40|$|Proteins are {{the most}} {{abundant}} macromolecules in living cells and their primary role in the diet is to supply the body with essential amino acids in adequate quantities for the synthesis and maintenance of body tissues. The determination of protein digestibility of foods {{is an important factor}} to estimate their quality and the in vitro methodology is a fast and easy way to perform it. This study aimed to determine the influence of lipids on the in vitro digestibility of animal and vegetable proteins. The following protein sources: oat, beef, chicken, fish and pork meats, red beans, milk powder, <b>textured</b> soy <b>protein</b> (TSP), quinoa and five soybean varieties were evaluated. Animal proteins presented higher in vitro values than vegetable proteins, except for the <b>textured</b> soy <b>protein,</b> which presented higher digestibility based on the thermal treatment. In this study, there was no statistic difference between lipid content and protein digestibility. Therefore, there is no need that samples be defatted prior the analysis of the in vitro digestibility, using an enzymatic system containing the enzymes trypsin and pancreatin, which facilitates even more the use of these methods for foods with high lipid levels in food industries...|$|R
50|$|Some {{vegetarian}} meat analogues {{are based}} on centuries-old recipes for seitan (wheat gluten), rice, mushrooms, legumes, tempeh, yam flour or pressed-tofu, with flavoring added to make the finished product taste like chicken, beef, lamb, ham, sausage, seafood, etc. Yuba and <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> (TVP) are other soy-based meat analogues. The first is made by layering the thin skin which forms on top of boiled soy milk. the second is a dry bulk commodity derived from soy and soy protein concentrate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Textured</b> {{vegetable}} <b>protein</b> {{was invented}} by the agricultural commodities and food processing company Archer Daniels Midland in the 1960s; the company owns the TVP name as a registered trademark. Archer Daniels Midland had developed a <b>textured</b> soy <b>protein</b> isolate made with an extruder {{in the shape of}} rods or tubes. The soy protein isolate was produced in a small pilot plant and sold to one or two customers for use in chili, but the product was not commercially successful. In September 1965, Dwayne O. Andreas and his brother Lowell took over leadership of Archer Daniels Midland. The brothers possessed extensive experience in the soybean processing industry. Dwayne Andreas was greatly impressed with TVP and its potential. Although, at the time, TVP was being produced only in the company's laboratories, Andreas could envision a host of potential uses for TVP, ranging from a meat extender to a low-cost protein source {{in a wide variety of}} foods. Under Andreas's leadership, TVP use expanded in the U.S.; by 1968, it was widely used in a variety of food products, and consumption skyrocketed after 1971, when TVP was approved for use in school lunch programs. By 1980, similar products were being produced by rival companies in America, but Archer Daniels Midland remained the leader in TVP production.|$|R
25|$|Vegetarian chili (also {{known as}} chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) {{acquired}} wide {{popularity in the}} U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s {{with the rise of}} vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> or tofu, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, mushrooms, or beets.|$|R
50|$|After the {{malnourished}} children recover {{enough to}} be able to digest complex foods, products containing higher levels of protein can be used to increase muscle growth. Plant protein foods such as <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>protein</b> have been advocated. Besides containing high amounts of protein, they also have a long shelf life and are inexpensive. Also, similar to tofu, plant protein can be manufactured in a more sustainable way than animal protein. This is an important question in areas such as Darfur, where cattle farming contributes to constant destruction of arable farmland.|$|R

40|$|Chicken nuggets are {{commonly}} made with {{varying levels of}} <b>textured</b> vegetable <b>proteins</b> such as soy and wheat, {{for their ability to}} bind water and their meat like conformation. This project compared <b>textured</b> wheat <b>proteins</b> and soy proteins at 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets. A total of 6, 048 chicken nuggets were evaluated in replications for batter breader pickup (%), par fry yield (%), cook loss (%), L*, a*, b* color value, texture profile analysis, and sensory analysis. Analysis was conducted for all four concentrations of wheat and soy treatments then compared to each other and an all-white meat chicken nugget control. All data was analyzed with a ? < 0. 05 using SAS with PROC GLM and Duncan?s MRT, except for sensory data which was analyzed as a complete randomized block design using analysis of variance with a ? < 0. 05, and was analyzed using SAS with PROC GLM. Results indicated that no notable trends were apparent in the quality testing. A trained sensory panel determined that Soy flavor was more detectable at 20 % and 30 % than wheat flavor was at similar levels. The results indicate that wheat proteins can replace soy proteins for functional properties in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets at all concentrations evaluated. It was also determined that wheat proteins could be used at levels up to 30 % without imparting a noticeable flavor...|$|R
