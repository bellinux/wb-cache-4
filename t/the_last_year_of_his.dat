5|$|Huggins had {{coached the}} young Rogers Hornsby, helping him to correct his batting stance, and Hornsby duly succeeded {{him as the}} team's {{starting}} second baseman in 1917 as Huggins ended his playing career.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

5|$|Wang Mang {{preserved}} these {{central government}} monopolies. When Eastern Han began, {{they were once}} again repealed, the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs. Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 AD) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 AD, but abolished them in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign. After Emperor Zhang, the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership.|$|E

On August 15, Goaltending coach Ron Low was named as assistant coach while Eli Wilson was named goaltending coach. Assistant coach Greg Carvel retained his duties.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period.

As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E

5|$|Yingzao Fashi is a {{technical}} treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by Li Jie, an architect and {{official at the}} Directorate of Buildings and Construction. Li completed the book in 1100, and presented it to Emperor Zhezong of Song in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign. His successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had Li's treatise officially published three years later, in 1103, {{for the benefit of}} foremen, architects, and literate craftsmen. The book was intended to provide standard regulations, to not only the engineering agencies of the central government, but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout China who could benefit from using a well-written government manual on building practices.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, {{it would be hard to}} maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, Britten {{accepted}} a life peerage – the first composer so honoured – becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices and orchestra {{based on a}} poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that {{he could no longer}} compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> administration, {{however, the}} Superior Audit Office of Mexico, the audit {{office of the}} Mexican federal government, {{discovered}} two irregularities in the city's spending and budget.

That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On November 8, 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive.|$|E

I {{can only hope that}} they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} most of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life {{in and out of}} hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E
