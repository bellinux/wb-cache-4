40|$|Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus intermedius (MRSI) {{are both}} major causes {{of skin and}} wound infections in humans and domesticated animal populations respectively. In order to investigate the colonization rates in pets, nose, mouth, or skin swabs were taken from 74 healthy pets (61 dogs and 13 cats) in south Louisiana, USA. Staphylococci were isolated by routine culture, speciated based on biochemical tests and confirmed by polymerase chain reactions. Our results show a 93 % (69 / 74) colonization rate of domesticated pets by coagulase positive Staphylococci, with 50 % (37 / 74) of animals harboring S. aureus, 43 % (32 / 74) being colonized with S. intermedius and 5. 4 % (4 / 74) of pets carrying MRSI. Two of the MRSI contained Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type III while one isolate contained a <b>type</b> <b>V</b> genetic element. The fourth MRSI isolate did not show any of the SCCmec <b>types</b> I- <b>V</b> <b>tested.</b> All of the 4 mecA positive strains were isolated from dogs.

Monospecific antibodies to <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen were detected with protein A-gold conjugates in tissue sections and epoxy-embedded sections of human amnion. <b>Type</b> <b>V</b> collagen was localized {{to the immediate}} vicinity of the basal lamina, but was distinct from laminin and type IV collagen, which localized only to the lamina lucida and lamina densa, respectively, of the basal lamina. At high magnification, 12 nm unbanded fibrils were seen to be labelled by anti-type V collagen antibody; these fibrils extended from the lamina densa of the basal lamina well into the interstitial matrix. In comparison, only the amorphous matrix of the lamina densa showed labelling with anti-type IV collagen antibodies. Anti-laminin antibodies labelled the lamina lucida. Quantitative analysis of grain distribution revealed the laminin labelling to be centered over the distal half of the lamina lucida (mean distance from the cell surface= 70 nm). In contrast, type IV collagen was centered over the lamina densa (mean= 115 nm). Both distributions were essentially Gaussian and distinct from the broad distribution of <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen. <b>Type</b> I collagen fibers with characteristic 67 nm periodicity were unlabelled with antibodies to <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen, although labelled <b>type</b> <b>V</b> fibrils were frequently enmeshed among the type I fibers. Antibodies to type I collagen labelled these fibers but not the <b>type</b> <b>V</b> fibrils. The results indicate that in human amnion, <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen is a 12 nm diameter, unbanded fibril which extends from the lamina densa of the basal lamina into the adjacent interstitial matrix.

Subsequent RNase protection assays revealed that that the <b>type</b> <b>V</b> signal is 4 – 5 times that for the type VI isozyme. In situ hybridization with high specific activity cRNA probes combined with immunocytochemistry with a chick anti-myosin antibody was used to probe the cellular origins of <b>type</b> <b>V</b> and <b>type</b> VI AC signals. These studies show that myocytes contain messages for both the <b>type</b> <b>V</b> and VI isozymes but that AC V is the major isoform.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{importance}} of <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen and its {{relationships with other}} types of collagen and with vascular and epithelial apoptosis were studied in a model of chemical carcinogenesis in the mouse lung. METHODS: Two groups of male Balb/c mice were studied: a) animals that received two intraperitoneal doses of 3 g/kg urethane carcinogen (urethane group = 24); and b) animals submitted to a sham procedure, comparable to the test group (control group = 7). Both groups were sacrificed after 120 days. In situ detection of apoptosis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and histomorphometry were used to evaluate the fraction occupied by the tumor, vascular and epithelial apoptosis, and <b>type</b> <b>V,</b> III and I collagen fibers in the lung parenchyma from both groups. RESULTS: The lung parenchyma from the urethane group showed low fractions of vascular and epithelial apoptosis as well as reduced <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen fibers when compared to the control group. A significant direct association was found between <b>type</b> <b>V</b> and III collagen fibers and epithelial apoptosis, <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen fibers and vascular apoptosis, and <b>type</b> <b>V</b> and <b>type</b> I collagen fibers. CONCLUSION: The results show that a direct link between low amounts of <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen and decreased cell apoptosis may favor cancer cell growth in the mouse lung after chemical carcinogenesis, suggesting that strategies aimed at preventing decreased <b>type</b> <b>V</b> collagen synthesis or local responses to reduced apoptosis may have a greater impact in lung cancer control.
