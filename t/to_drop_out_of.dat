5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation {{to take his}} place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics.

When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson {{to remain as}} a candidate. Johnson replied {{that it was not}} {{in the best interest of}} the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Nicky is persuaded <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{university}} {{and work for}} corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better.

Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{unsuccessful}} bids {{came from}} Seattle Public Schools, who had proposed renovating the building into {{an elementary school}} in 2014, the first downtown school in 65 years.
