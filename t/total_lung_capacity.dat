Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{respiration}} is {{a process}} that always occurs in all living things including humans. However, the process is abstract and difficult to observe by most people, including high school students. Simulation is one way to explain respiration and it {{can be used as a}} medium of learning for the students. Respiratory process consists of inspiration and expiration. The inspiration is the process of oxygen entry from the environment into the lungs (alveolus) and expiration is the process of carbon dioxide exit from the lungs (alveoli) into the environment. The respiratory mechanism includes the changes of air volume in the lungs and the frequency of human breathing. The changes of the air volume and the respiratory frequency depend on physical factors such as gender, type of activity, age, weight, and height of humans. These physical factors may be treated as input variables that affect the changes of the air volume and the breathing frequency. In this paper, a model of lung volume and breathing frequency are developed for human respiratory simulation. The model is a modified model of proposed models in the literatures. In the model of lung volume and breathing frequency, the following factors are considered, i. e. tidal volume (VT), functional residual <b>capacity</b> (FRC), <b>total</b> <b>lungs</b> <b>capacity</b> (TLC), inspiratory volume (VI) and expiratory volume (VE). The model of lungs volume is then used to visualize the process of expansion and contraction of the lungs. Meanwhile, the model of breathing frequency is used to visualize the duration of the expansion and contraction of the lungs. Breathing period (T) is a time taken for a single breathing that consists of the time for inspiration and expiration. These inspiration and expiration times may be modified and adapted to model of various physical conditions and needs of the humans...|$|R
40|$|High {{altitude}} natives have enlarged vital {{capacities and}} residual volumes (RV). Because pulmonary volumes are {{an indication of}} functionally relevant traits, such as diffusion capacity, {{the understanding of the}} factors (genetic/developmental) that influence lung volumes provides insight into the adaptive responses of highlanders. In order to test for the effect of growth and development at high altitude on lung volumes, we obtained forced vital capacities (FVC), RV, and <b>total</b> <b>lung</b> <b>capacities</b> (TLC) for a sample of 65 Peruvian females of mostly Quechua origins (18 – 34 years) who were sub‐divided into two well‐matched groups: 1) sea‐level born and raised females (BSL, n = 34) from Lima, Peru (150 m), and 2) high‐altitude born and raised females (BHA, n = 31) from Cerro de Pasco, Peru (4, 338 m). To determine Quechua origins, Native American ancestry proportion (NAAP) for each individual was assessed using a panel of 70 ancestry informative markers. NAAP was similar between groups (BSL = 91. 71 %; BHA = 89. 93 %; P = 0. 240), and the analysis confirmed predominantly Quechua origins. After adjusting for body size and NAAP, BHA females had significantly higher FVC (3. 79 ± 0. 06 l; P < 0. 001), RV (0. 98 ± 0. 03 l; P < 0. 001) and TLC (4. 80 ± 0. 07 l; P < 0. 001) compared to BSL females (FVC = 3. 33 ± 0. 05 l; RV = 0. 69 ± 0. 03 l; TLC = 4. 02 ± 0. 06 l). NAAP was not associated with FVC (P = 0. 352) or TLC (P = 0. 506). However, NAAP was positively associated with RV (P = 0. 004). In summary, results indicate that developmental exposure to high altitude in females constitutes an important factor for all lung volumes, whereas both genetic and developmental factors seem to be important for RV.

500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced <b>total</b> <b>lung</b> <b>capacity</b> and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in {{the rhythm of the}} cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E
