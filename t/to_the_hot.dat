5|$|At a VA {{hospital}} in Fort Evanston, Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans makes his third suicide attempt; {{he claims that}} a mysterious figure will not let him die. Stans attempts to drown in a tub of scalding water, but is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> water. Stans again claims that the mysterious figure will not let him die.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

5|$|The Santa Ana {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot,</b> dry interior and semi-desert basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns {{on the bottom of the}} pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E

5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Khaldun, the Arab {{sociologist}} and polymath, similarly linked {{skin color}} to environmental factors. In his Muqaddimah (1377), {{he wrote that}} black skin was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> climate of sub-Saharan Africa and not due to African lineage. He thereby challenged Hamitic theories of race that held that the sons of Ham (son of Noah) were cursed with black skin. Many writings of Ibn Khaldun were translated during the colonial era in order to advance the colonial propaganda machine.|$|E

40|$|Spin waves (or magnons) {{interact}} with magnetic domain walls (DWs) {{in a complicated}} way that a DW can propagate either along or against magnon flow. However, thermally activated magnons always drive a DW <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> region of a nanowire of magnetic insulators under a temperature gradient. We theoretically illustrate why it is surely so by showing that DW entropy is always larger {{than that of a}} domain as long as material parameters do not depend on spin textures. Equivalently, the total free energy of the wire can be lowered when <b>the</b> DW moves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> region. <b>The</b> larger DW entropy is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increase of magnon density of states at low energy originated from the gapless magnon bound states...|$|R
25|$|Following {{promotion}} to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult 2014–2015 campaign.

After a poor start to the Championship, Chris Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> seat in interim charge.|$|E
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> {{summer and}} low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is endorheic, i.e. its rivers either {{disappear}} in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in the neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of flowing toward an ocean. The only exception is the northernmost part of the region, where the Irtysh River, originating in the Altai Mountains, flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the Arctic Ocean. Even then, {{a significant part of}} this river's waters is now artificially diverted, via the Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal, to the drier areas of southern Dzungarian Basin.|$|E
25|$|A {{dehumidification}} chamber {{can be an}} unvented system (closed loop) or {{a partially}} vented system which uses a heat pump to condense moisture from the air using cold side of the refrigeration process (evaporator.) The heat thus gathered is sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> side of the refrigeration process (condenser) to re-heat the air and returns this drier and warmer air inside the kiln. Fans blow the air through the piles as in a normal kiln. These kilns traditionally operate from 100°F to 160°F and use about half the energy of a conventional kiln.|$|E
