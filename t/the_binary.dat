5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number <b>the</b> <b>binary</b> number system denotes {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>binary</b> point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers {{to the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>binary</b> point represent the fractional part.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>binary</b> GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting <b>the</b> <b>binary</b> representation used by computers.

Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. <b>The</b> <b>binary</b> algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed.

The RVs were computed using our novel iodine cell technique for double-line binary stars, which relies on tomographically disentangled spectra of the components of <b>the</b> <b>binaries.</b> <b>The</b> precision of the RVs is of the order of 1 – 10 m s− 1, and to properly model such measurements one needs to account for the light-time effect within <b>the</b> <b>binary’s</b> orbit, relativistic effects, and RV variations due to tidal distortions of the components of <b>the</b> <b>binaries.</b> With such proper modeling, our RVs combined with the archival visibility measurements from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) allow us to derive very precise spectroscopic/astrometric orbital and physical parameters of <b>the</b> <b>binaries.</b> In particular, we derive the masses, the absolute K- and H-band magnitudes, and the parallaxes.

40|$|Despite the Victorian society’s {{dismissal}} of sensation novels as low-brow literature and scholars’ {{lack of attention}} to the genre in terms of its contributions to the hidden feminist movement in the Victorian era, novels like Braddon’s Lady Audley’s Secret take the misogynistic language and tropes of the era, reshape them with their own ideals, and thus subvert the patriarchal models within literature and the society. This research expands from the groundwork on women’s literature in the Victorian era laid by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, as well as Elaine Showalter, to the less-explored genre of Victorian sensation fiction. Showalter, Gilbert, and Gubar identified binaries that appeared prevalent throughout women’s writing of the era. Specifically, this work will look at <b>the</b> Angel/Monster <b>binary</b> that Gilbert and Gubar identified, as well as <b>the</b> Sane/Insane <b>binary</b> that Showalter suggests.
