25|$|The {{subject of}} {{divergent}} series, as a domain of mathematical analysis, is {{primarily concerned with}} explicit and natural techniques such as Abel summation, Cesàro summation and Borel summation, and their relationships. The advent of Wiener's <b>tauberian</b> theorem marked an epoch in the subject, introducing unexpected connections to Banach algebra methods in Fourier analysis.|$|E
25|$|The term {{elementary}} generally denotes {{a method}} that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg. The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex <b>Tauberian</b> theorems (e.g. Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.|$|E
25|$|A summability method M is regular if it {{agrees with}} the actual limit on all {{convergent}} series. Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical Abel's theorem. More interesting, and in general more subtle, are partial converse results, called <b>tauberian</b> theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber. Here partial converse means that if M sums the series Σ, and some side-condition holds, then Σ was convergent in the first place; without any side-condition such a result would say that M only summed convergent series (making it useless as a summation method for divergent series).|$|E

Furthermore, techniques such as partial summation and <b>Tauberian</b> theorems {{can be used to}} get information about the coefficients from analytic information about the Dirichlet series. Thus a common method for estimating a multiplicative function is to express it as a Dirichlet series (or a product of simpler Dirichlet series using convolution identities), examine this series as a complex function and then convert this analytic information back into information about the original function.|$|E
2500|$|During the 20th century, the theorem of Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin {{also became}} known as the Prime Number Theorem. Several {{different}} proofs of it were found, including the [...] "elementary" [...] proofs of Atle Selberg and Paul Erdős (1949). While the original proofs of Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin are long and elaborate, later proofs introduced various simplifications through the use of <b>Tauberian</b> theorems but remained difficult to digest. A short proof was discovered in 1980 by American mathematician Donald J. Newman. Newman's proof is arguably the simplest known proof of the theorem, although it is non-elementary {{in the sense that it}} uses Cauchy's integral theorem from complex analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, we can {{conclude}} that the PNT is [...] "morally" [...] true. To rigorously complete the proof there are still serious technicalities to overcome, {{due to the fact}} that the summation over zeta zeros in the explicit formula for [...] does not converge absolutely but only conditionally and in a [...] "principal value" [...] sense. There are several ways around this problem but many of them require rather delicate complex-analytic estimates that are beyond the scope of this article. Edwards's book provides the details. Another method is to use Ikehara's <b>Tauberian</b> theorem, though this theorem is itself quite hard to prove. D. J. Newman observed that the full strength of Ikehara's theorem is not needed for the prime number theorem, and one can get away with a special case that is much easier to prove.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, some mathematicians (notably G. H. Hardy) {{believed}} that there exists a hierarchy of proof methods in mathematics depending on what sorts of numbers (integers, reals, complex) a proof requires, and that the prime number theorem (PNT) is a [...] "deep" [...] theorem by virtue of requiring complex analysis. This belief was somewhat shaken by a proof of the PNT based on Wiener's <b>tauberian</b> theorem, though this could be set aside if Wiener's theorem were deemed to have a [...] "depth" [...] equivalent to that of complex variable methods. There is no rigorous and widely accepted definition of the notion of elementary proof in number theory. One definition is [...] "a proof that can be carried out in first order Peano arithmetic." [...] There are number-theoretic statements (for example, the Paris–Harrington theorem) provable using second order but not first order methods, but such theorems are rare to date.|$|E
