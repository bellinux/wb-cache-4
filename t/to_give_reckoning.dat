What am I referring to when I apologize for not giving the talk I was supposed <b>to</b> <b>give?</b> Never mind the content of that talk— I can always give you a summary of what I meant to say, if you wish. Indeed, I might even decide <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a talk with that content on a different occasion. The content, however, is not the talk, and if I gave a talk with that content on a different occasion I would not, on my <b>reckoning,</b> <b>give</b> the talk I was supposed <b>to</b> <b>give.</b> For the talk I was supposed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> is something {{that was supposed to}} take place today, and {{that is not going to}} happen.

Let us assume Davidson was right in urging that events form a genuine metaphysical category, on a par with material objects. 1 Shall we say that a good inventory of the world ought to include “negative ” events—failures, omissions, things that didn’t happen—along with positive ones...|$|R

40|$|By {{natural or}} {{man-made}} disasters, {{the evacuation of}} a whole region or city may become necessary. Apart from private traffic, the evacuation from collection points to secure shelters outside the endangered region will be realized by a bus fleet made available by emergency relief. The arising Bus Evacuation Problem (BEP) is a vehicle scheduling problem, in which a given number of evacuees needs to be transported from a set of collection points {{to a set of}} capacitated shelters, minimizing the total evacuation time, i. e., the time needed until the last person is brought to safety. In this paper we consider an extended version of the BEP, the Robust Bus Evacuation Problem (RBEP), in which the exact numbers of evacuees are not known, but may stem from a set of probable scenarios. However, after a <b>given</b> <b>reckoning</b> time, this uncertainty is eliminated and planners are given exact figures. The problem is to decide for each bus, if it is better to send it right away [...] using uncertain numbers of evacuees [...] or to wait until the numbers become known. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the RBEP and discuss solution approaches; in particular, we present a tabu search framework for finding heuristic solutions of acceptable quality within short computation time. In computational experiments using both randomly generated instances and the real-world scenario of evacuating the city of Kaiserslautern, we compare our solution approaches...|$|R
