40|$|Highly {{textured}} Fe-Ga (Galfenol) {{rolled sheet}} with Cube (100) or Goss (110) preferred orientation {{is under investigation}} to provide easy magnetization, enhanced magnetostrictive performance and a cost-effective option for production of these alloys for use in applications as sensors and actuators. In this study, 1 - 2. 5 % NbC added Galfenol rolled sheet was used because NbC particles enhance the rollability of and abnormal grain growth (AGG) in polycrystalline Galfenol rolled sheet. Driving forces, due to grain boundary energy, surface energy, deformation energy and magnetic fields are generally considered to explain grain growth phenomena. In this dissertation, the effect on grain boundary energy for influencing AGG was studied for the case of high temperature annealing at 1200 °C. Both Coincident Site Lattice (CSL) and High Energy Grain Boundary (HEGB) models were investigated as possible mechanisms to explain the contribution of grain boundary energy to Goss-textured AGG. Results support the HEGB model as a suitable model for the observed development of Goss-textured AGG in Galfenol rolled sheet. Next, the effect of deformation energy on AGG was studied by using <b>tension</b> <b>annealing</b> and strain annealing methods in the temperature range of 900 °C to 1100 °C. This study was built on results from studies of grain boundary energy on other alloys. For the <b>tension</b> <b>annealing</b> investigation, Galfenol rolled sheet was simultaneously subjected to tensile loading during high temperature annealing. No AGG was observed from the <b>tension</b> <b>annealing</b> method. For the strain-annealing investigation, homogeneously recrystallized Galfenol rolled sheet with a taper was subjected to tensile loading under different strain rates and post-strain high temperature anneal conditions to investigate the resultant grain growth phenomena. Different grain growth modes, including Cube- and Goss-textured AGG, were observed in this study. Assessment {{of the extent of}} AGG resulting from these was conducted using Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD) patterns that were captured and analyzed using Orientation Imaging Microscope (OIM) software to obtain Inverse Pole Figures (IPF) and Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). Additionally, Ga loss, which lowers the magnetostrictive properties, under different conditions was investigated by Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA). No significant Ga loss was observed during the annealing process at 1000 °C, however, about 2 % Ga loss was observed during the annealing process at 1100 °C and 1200 °C in the areas with a high density of grain boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Polypropylene {{filament}} yarns, {{when compared}} with polyethyleneterephthalate andpolyamide yarns have lower stretchability after being false twist textured. To over-come this deficiency, other researchers have tried to lower the degree of crys-tallinity of this fibre by either <b>tension</b> <b>annealing</b> or blending it with polyethyleneterephtha-late and polystyrene. These physical or chemical modifications have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of enhancement of the textureability of polypropylene. Considering the importance of BCF polypropylene yarns, in this research, the effect of blending polypropylene with 12. 5 and 25 % of polyamide 6 on {{the bulk of the}} final bulked continu-ous filament (BCF) yarn has been investigated. The results show that although both crimp contraction and crimp modulus increase with the temperature and pressure of hot air during texturing, but blending polypropylene with even 25 % of polyamide 6 does not enhance the textureability of BCF yarns. Also, the reduction in the crystallinity of the yarns does not lead to any improvement in the textureability of the polypropylene BCF yarns. polymer blending; polypropylene; polyamide 6; continuous filament...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructures of stereocomplex {{polylactide}} (sc-PLA) {{are obtained}} and studied in poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) doped {{with a low}} amount of poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) during successive melt-quenching, extrusion, spinning, and drawing processes corresponding to quiescent, shear flow, elongational flow, and <b>tensioned</b> <b>annealing</b> conditions, respectively. Nanogranules of predominantly sc-PLA are initially formed with rapid quenching in quiescent and shear flow, which developed into microspheres with slow quenching and uniform nanofibrils in elongational flow. While only amorphous or the -form PLLA is formed with the quenched melts and macroscopic fibers, the embedded nanogranules and nanofibrils are highly crystallized with the coexistence of sc-PLA and the -crystals. A 1 D coalescence of nascent sc-nuclei into nanofibrils in elongational flow is preliminarily proposed to explain the structure evolution and the minor reinforcement of the nanofibrils on the macroscopic fibers...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} and evolution of coherent islands on lattice mismatched epitaxially strained films. Faceted islands form in films with aniostropic surface <b>tension.</b> Under <b>annealing,</b> these islands ripen until a stable array is formed, with an island density which increases with film thickness. Under deposition, an island shape transition occurs, {{which leads to a}} bimodal island size distribution. In films with isotropic surface tension we observe continual ripening of islands above a certain film thickness. A stable wavy morphology is found in thinner films.

40|$|Cu 2 O and {{two types}} Of Cu 2 O-Ag-Cu 2 O (CAC) {{multilayered}} thin films were deposited on glass substrates using DC-magnetron sputtering. For CAC films, the mass thickness of Ag layer was controlled at 3 nm. After deposition, {{some of these}} films were annealed using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) system at 650 degrees C, {{in order to create}} embedded Ag particles. AC films were used to study the clustering effect of Ag in Ar atmosphere, as well as for forming the 2 nd type of CAC film by covering another Cu 2 O layer on the annealed AC structure. A UV-VIS-NIR photometer, a Hall measurement system, and a I-V measurement system were used to characterize the optical and electrical properties of these films with and without RTA. The results show that 2 -dimensional Ag layer can transform into many individual particles due to its high surface <b>tension</b> at <b>annealing</b> temperature, no matter when the annealing was carried out. For CAC films, without annealing, the optical transmission and the resistivity are decreased with the inserted Ag layer. After annealing, both the transmission and resistivity are increased, possibly due to the clustering effect of Ag layer. Most importantly, it is found that the embedded Ag particles can increase the light absorption in the NIR-IR region, which can increase photo-induced current. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The giant magneto-impedance (GMI) {{effect of the}} stress-joule-heated ribbons under applied tensile stress ranging from 37 to 148 MPa was investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} spectra of GMI ratio vs. exter-nal direct current (dc) field (Hex) of the samples changes dramatically with <b>annealing</b> <b>tension</b> (？) and driving frequency. The single-peak (SP) GMI curve with maximum GMI ratio of 260 % and magnetic field sensitivity of 52 %/Oe was obtained in the sample applied tensile stress of 74 MPa at frequency of 3. 6 MHz. A three-peak behaviour appeared in the samples under σof 111 and 148 MPa. The uncommon three-peak behaviour was attributedto several factors, which effectively originated from the balance between domain-wall movement and magnetization rotation...|$|R
