5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of}} the lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near <b>the</b> <b>body</b> wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter <b>the</b> <b>body</b> fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|A {{recreation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Body</b> Worlds exhibit {{provided a}} setting for one {{scene in the}} film. Among <b>the</b> <b>Body</b> Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the Poker Playing Trio (which {{plays a key role}} in one scene) and Rearing Horse and Rider. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.|$|E
5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> was washed, {{wrapped in a}} white sheet {{and placed in a}} weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward on one side and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> slid off into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels in many parts of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the family}} obtains the CCOD, they usually engage a funeral {{director}} (also {{known as an}} undertaker) who collects <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> embalms it if necessary, and delivers it to the wake. In addition, they {{have to decide whether}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is to be cremated or buried, and register the death. The funeral director also helps to make arrangements for the wake and funeral, according to the religious beliefs and wishes of the family.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E

60|$|In some cases, {{instead of}} the {{aromatic}} resin, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> were filled with bitumen; in others saltpeter was used, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> being soaked in {{it for a long}} time and finally filled with resin and bitumen. In the second quality of mummies, those of persons of the middle class, the incision was not made, but resin or bitumen was used and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> soaked in salt for a long time. In the case of the poorer classes <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> were simply dipped into liquid pitch. None of these, however, were treated in the establishment of Chigron, who operated only upon <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> of <b>the</b> wealthy.|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not attached to <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and {{are said to}} be exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with <b>the</b> <b>body</b> (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of two primary <b>bodies</b> with <b>the</b> same mass , which move in circular or elliptical Kepler orbits around their center of mass. <b>The</b> third <b>body,</b> which is substantially smaller than <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> and whose mass can be set to zero , moves {{under the influence of}} <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> in a plane that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of <b>the</b> primary <b>bodies</b> (see Figure 1).

5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E

50|$|It was the {{investigating}} detectives' {{belief that}} <b>the</b> victims' <b>bodies</b> were covered {{not by a}} murderer, but by a 'third person' who covered them for modesty after discovering <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> An initial suspect was a voyeur who contacted police twice, using different names. After interrogation, he was quickly dismissed. The prime suspect was a greyhound trainer who slipped his dogs daily on a path that passed the site where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> were found. He came forward only after his car was identified and, when interviewed by police, claimed to have used a different path that day and denied seeing <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> His obituary in 1977, however, claimed {{he had been the}} first to find <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>The</b> theory regarding a motive of modesty for covering <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> was supported by claims that the man was known to be a prude.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} are only used in certain {{sections of the}} cloth.

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat.
