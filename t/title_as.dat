This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this <b>title,</b> <b>as</b> director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the <b>title</b> <b>as</b> a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided {{to make it an}} outright drama.

The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E
