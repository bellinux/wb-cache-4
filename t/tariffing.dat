5000|$|Contention ratios are {{essentially}} just planning rules {{which are used}} to design a network offering (typically) an Internet service. The perception {{of the quality of}} that service will depend on the actual usage of the users of the service. This is partly why rules such as 20:1 for business and 50:1 for residential users came about. The actual usage demands of users have changed over the years and for evening/weekend traffic residential users can be demanding a lot of bandwidth making 50:1 contention ratios inappropriate. Contention ratios also only really make sense if dealing with relatively consistent speeds. The fact that a single back-haul in the UK could have users at 500 kbit/s and users at 100 Mbit/s makes normal contention ratio planning a thing of the past. In practice, a well run network aims to avoid links hitting limits, and upgrades the links when they do - this only works where the pricing model allows extra revenue to pay for the higher usage links and this is hitting some [...] "unlimited use" [...] <b>tariffing</b> models.|$|E

The fact that the <b>tariffing</b> may affect demand and, hence, the dimensioning makes it essential that the operating company include the tariff/demand trade-off in determining the optimal way to dimension the loss network.

40|$|Individual {{services}} and tariffs existed {{briefly in the}} beginning of telecommunications history 150 years ago but faded away over time. Service provisioning evolved into the current supplier-centric situation which has many limitations and disadvantages. This thesis re-embraces the user-centric service provisioning and <b>tariffing</b> philosophy and applies it to current mobile communication services setting, which differs significantly in scale and scope from the historical practices. A design methodology and tool for the determination of individualized mobile {{services and}} tariffs is provided, and benefits to both the user and the supplier are evaluated. The design has three aspects. The first involves the construction of a conceptual framework consisting of the behavioral models of the user and the supplier (firm) and a game theoretical negotiation mechanism to determine individual services and tariffs. Second is the operationalization of the conceptual framework in a computational design with methods, computational models, negotiation algorithms, risk metrics and a prototype implementation. Third is the extension of the individual services and tariffs concept to a community setting via a proposed community business model. Two evaluations are performed. First, for the firm-based design, a user survey is conducted and computational cases, that address value-added mobile services and generic mobile service bundles, are developed. The numerical analyses show that the users always achieve gains in utility. The benefits to the supplier include adjustable risk-profit equilibrium points, increased network traffic and reduced churn. Second, two case studies on communities are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed business model of community-based individual service provisioning and <b>tariffing</b> can meet the demands of their members precisely and address both affordability and sustainability issues. Last, a specific engineering implementation and integration of the individualized service and tariff design tools into the existing infrastructure of the communication services suppliers is proposed.
