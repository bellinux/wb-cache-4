5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> Whitehead and <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> {{childhood}} in Postwar Japan. In this paper, I use the word 2 ̆ 2 <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood 2 ̆ 2 not in the sense of thought about childhood but of Japanese general image about childhood. The concept can be defined as adult-child relation. First, I analyze sixteen Best Seller Novels in Postwar Japan, which were published between 1946 and 1999. In this way, I use two approaches: <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood and <b>the</b> feeling of Novels 2 ̆ 7 characters. The findings of this analysis show three types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Japanese childhood. <b>The</b> first is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood as <b>the</b> immaturer being than adult. The second is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood as <b>the</b> relativization of adult-child relation. The third is <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood as subject being like adult. Secondly, I analyze the social background in Postwar Japan, which were relate to three types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Japanese Childhood. There is, for example, the relation between the divorce rate and childhood as the immaturer being than adult, the relation between the ralio of students who enter higher 2 ̆ 7 educalion and The childhood as the relativlzation of adult-child relation, the relation between the trend of child 2 ̆ 7 s right and <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood as subject being like adult, the relation between the total fertility rate and <b>the</b> whole <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood in Postwar Japan. In conclusion, (1) In Postwar Japan, <b>the</b> whole <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood change a little. (2) The change of social background in Postwar Japan creates the new types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> childhood.

In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.|$|E

Falkheimer and Heide (2003) claim that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> transmission is one-way communication where the receivers apprehend passivly. In <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> creation of meaning the goal is to develop and strengthen the common notion that exists in a group. Empirical studies were done, that consisted of qualitative interviews with politicians, directors of the municipality, and principals from three childcare and school areas, and also from one upper secondary school. Staff from different schools on different levels answered structural questions from a web inquiry. The results are showing that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> transmission is more common than <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> creation of meaning. The structure in the organization is creating a traditional <b>view</b> <b>of</b> communication, where goals are created and decisions are made on an overarching level. It is important with a strategic plan for the processes of goal steering on every level.

Then, we construct a PPT simulator-extractor SE via the intermediate simulator S, which can simulate <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> A and extract the witnesses by the committed value oracle. Simulator S On a high level, S internally invokes A and interacts with A as honest prover and honest verifier in the following way. To simulate <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> each session in the right interactions, S simply follows the honest verifier strategy. To simulate <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> each session in the left interactions, S uses the description of the adversary A as the fake witness and reused the previous generated P-certificates if necessary in a straight-line manner. The formal description of this process will be given below. Finally, S outputs <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adversary A.
