According to one study, AAS users also distrust <b>their</b> <b>physicians</b> and in the sample 56% had not disclosed their AAS use to <b>their</b> <b>physicians.</b> Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in <b>their</b> <b>physicians,</b> 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users {{were more likely to have}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. A recent study in the Journal of Health Psychology showed that many users believed that steroids used in moderation were safe.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Aim was to {{investigate}} the psychometric properties of a Dutch version of the "Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale", which intends to measure patients' trust in <b>their</b> <b>physician.</b> Methods: A random sample of internal medicine patients visiting the outpatient clinic completed the questionnaire (N = 201). Dimensionality, reliability and validity of the instrument were examined. Results: The structure of the questionnaire was best explained by a unidimensional construct. Reliability was confirmed: internal consistency was high (alpha =. 88), and mean item-total correlations were all above. 40. Construct validity was indicated by patients' trust in <b>their</b> <b>physician</b> correlating significantly and as hypothesized with (1) satisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>physician</b> (r =. 64), (2) with the length of the patient-physician relationship (r =. 28),(3) with their willingness to recommend <b>their</b> <b>physician</b> (r =. 71) and (4) their unwillingness to switch <b>their</b> <b>physician</b> (r =. 61). Conclusion: The results suggest the Dutch version of the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale to be a psychometrically sound instrument to assess patients' interpersonal trust. Practice implications: Trust is a key feature of the patient-physician relationship, yet has been scarcely researched in other than Anglophone cultures. An adequate Dutch trust questionnaire forms the first step to gaining more knowledge about patient-physician trust in another culture and health care setting. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Concurrently, AVS launched—together with the ACLU and Zero Population Growth—"Operation Lawsuit": a series of successful lawsuits against various U.S. hospitals for refusing to comply with patients' requests for sterilization. These campaigns resulted in the increasingly widespread acceptance in the medical profession that sterilization was an effective birth control method, and that sterilization decision making was purely a matter between patients and <b>their</b> <b>physicians.</b> AVS also worked to establish the first informed consent and client-counseling components in health services and produced {{one of the first}} manuals on family planning counseling.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{focus in}} the {{curriculum}} begins on day one, {{in the introduction to}} being a physician course. Students interview patients about their experience of illness and experiences with <b>their</b> <b>physicians,</b> and they visit community settings to develop an understanding of their roles as medical professionals. Medical interviewing and physical examination courses follow, along with exercises examining the many facets of physician life—in society, ethical settings, and at the patient bedside. Throughout the first two years, students apply their new skills in local practices and hospitals one afternoon per week. The basic science block runs through three-fourths of the first year and provides language and concepts that underlie the scientific basis of medical practice. Organ system block courses integrate physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and patient with concurrent courses in the patient care and patient, physician and society blocks. Weekly discussions, patient interviews, and examination of hospitalized patients reinforce essential clinical skills.|$|E

For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function. The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order {{to improve the lives of}} taste disorder sufferers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} predict whether patients prefer seeing <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians</b> {{and whether they}} do see <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians</b> during acute illness. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey. SETTING: Urban areas in southern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 304 people who had regular physicians, insurance coverage, and had last seen a physician for acute illness. Of the 304, 256 (84. 2 %) preferred seeing <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians</b> during acute illness, and 48 (15. 8 %) did not. Of those who preferred seeing <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians,</b> 131 (51. 2 %) did see <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians,</b> 125 (48. 8 %) did not MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preference for seeing regular physician and seeing regular physician during acute illness. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression found that believing continuity of care was important and traveling further increased, while recent hospitalization and difficulty seeing physicians during or after office hours decreased, the likelihood of actually seeing <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians.</b> CONCLUSION: Almost half the patients who preferred seeing <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians</b> for acute illness did not actually see <b>their</b> regular <b>physicians.</b> Improving access to regular physicians might encourage patients to always try to see them...|$|R

500|$|In 1843, Holmes {{published}} [...] "The Contagiousness of puerperal fever" [...] in {{the short-lived}} publication New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery. The essay argued—contrary {{to popular belief}} at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of puerperal fever, a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient to patient contact via <b>their</b> <b>physicians.</b> Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of puerperal fever had occurred, had {{a moral obligation to}} purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice for a period of at least six months. A few years later, Ignaz Semmelweis would reach similar conclusions in Vienna, where his introduction of prophylaxis (handwashing in chlorine solution before assisting at delivery) would considerably lower the puerperal mortality rate.|$|E

2500|$|Patient-Physician {{communication}} involves two sides. While {{physicians and}} other healthcare providers are being encouraged or {{required to be}} culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to <b>their</b> <b>physicians</b> and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and interpretation services. Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the General Medical Council issued guidance for patients [...] "What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients" [...] in April 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} situs inversus totalis {{are unaware of}} their unusual anatomy until they seek medical {{attention}} for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a Barium meal or enema. The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms {{will be on the}} atypical side. For example, if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies. Thus, {{in the event of a}} medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform <b>their</b> <b>physicians</b> before an examination, so the physician can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. [...] Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.|$|E
2500|$|Up to 25% of {{patients}} with TB of the lymph nodes (TB lymphadenitis) will get worse on treatment before they get better and this usually happens {{in the first few}} months of treatment. A few weeks after starting treatment, lymph nodes often start to enlarge, and previously solid lymph nodes may soften and develop into tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis. [...] This should not be interpreted as failure of therapy and is a common reason for patients (and <b>their</b> <b>physicians)</b> to panic unnecessarily. [...] With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working. [...] In these situations, all that is required is re-assurance. [...] Steroids may be useful in resolving the swelling, especially if it is painful, but they are unnecessary. [...] Additional antibiotics are unnecessary and the treatment regimen does not need to be lengthened.|$|E

2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with <b>their</b> <b>physicians.</b> [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E

60|$|Every {{word she}} had uttered, every action she had displayed, had {{sunk into the}} inmost heart, had stirred the fiercest passions of the young warrior whom she addressed. The first {{national}} sentiment discoverable in the day-spring of the ages of Gothic history, is the love of war; but {{the second is the}} reverence of woman. This latter feeling--especially remarkable among so fierce and unsusceptible a people as the ancient Scandinavians--was entirely unconnected with those strong attaching ties, which are the natural consequence of the warm temperaments of more southern nations; for love was numbered with the base inferior passions, in the frigid and hardy composition of the warrior of the north. It was the offspring of reasoning and observation, not of instinctive sentiment and momentary impulse. In the wild, poetical code of the old Gothic superstition was one axiom, closely and strangely approximating to an important theory in the Christian scheme--the watchfulness of an omnipotent Creator over a finite creature. Every action of the body, every impulse of the mind, was the immediate result, in the system of worship among the Goths of the direct, though invisible interference of the divinities they adored. When, therefore, they observed that women were more submitted in body to the mysterious laws of nature and temperament, and more swayed in mind by the native and universal instincts of humanity than themselves, they inferred as an inevitable conclusion, that the female sex was more incessantly regarded, and more constantly and remarkably influenced by the gods of their worship, than the male. Acting under this persuasion, they committed the study of medicine, the interpretation of dreams, and in many instances, the mysteries of communication with the invisible world, to the care of their women. The gentler sex became their counsellors in difficulty, and <b>their</b> <b>physicians</b> in sickness--their companions rather than their mistresses,--the objects of their veneration rather than the purveyors of their pleasures. Although in after years, the national migrations of the Goths changed the national temperament, although their ancient mythology was exchanged for the worship of Christ, this prevailing sentiment of their earliest existence as a people never entirely deserted them; but, with different modifications and in different forms, maintained much of its old supremacy through all changes of manners and varieties of customs, descending finally to their posterity among the present nations of Europe, in the shape of that established code of universal courtesy to women, which is admitted to be one great distinguishing mark between the social systems of the inhabitants of civilised and uncivilised lands.|$|E
