5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a {{prerecorded}} message from Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the ARK <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that the comet was likely <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers {{had never before}} seen two significant Solar System bodies collide. Intense studies of the comet were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, {{the possibility of a}} collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to look inside Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientist}} to extrapolate the current {{motions of the}} continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would move across the Indian Ocean <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with Asia.|$|E

After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{collisions}} of gliders {{generated by}} one-dimensional Rule 110 cel-lular automaton. A specic value {{associated with each}} glider and an algebraic equation that describes the collision between two gliders were found. Because {{the products of the}} collision between two gliders may result in no gliders or one, two or more gliders, this equation states that the total sum of the associated values corresponding <b>to</b> <b>colliding</b> gliders equals the sum of the values of the gliders which are products of the collision. Moreover, an analogy is proposed between the glider collisions and the collisions of phys-ical particles with the equation corresponding <b>to</b> <b>colliding</b> gliders being similar to the equation of energy conservation in physics. In this scheme, even without carrying out the temporal evolution for a collision, it can be determined if a possible combination of resulting gliders accomplishes the equation corresponding to that collision...|$|R
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator {{were collected in}} his storage rings and then directed <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device {{to be capable of}} only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner. Reutimann made contact with Johnson, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with the wall and damage his car's suspension on lap two. The first caution of the race was subsequently given. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution, and Johnson drove to his garage to change his front and rear suspension. Jeff Gordon maintained his lead on the lap eight restart. Kurt Busch passed Jeff Gordon on the low side of the track for the lead position four laps later. After starting twenty-ninth, Robby Gordon had moved up thirteen positions to sixteenth by lap 34. One lap later, Johnson's car was fitted with a new driveshaft.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with enemies. The elevation {{of an enemy}} {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} spatial Kerr solitons is {{extended}} <b>to</b> <b>colliding</b> beams that are neither almost-exactly copropagating nor almost-exactly counterpropagating. Our new Helmholtz formalism yields {{results that are}} consistent with the inherent symmetry of the collision process and that are not predicted by existing paraxial descriptions. Full numerical and approximate analytical results are presented. These show excellent agreement. In particular, Kerr solitons are found to be remarkably robust under nonparaxial collisions...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} role of colliding {{geometry}} on the N/Z dependence of balance energy using isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model. Our study reveals that the N/Z dependence of balance energy becomes much steeper for peripheral collisions {{as compared to the}} central collisions. We also study the effect of system mass on the impact parameter dependence of N/Z dependence of balance energy. The study shows that lighter systems shows greater sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>colliding</b> geometry towards the N/Z dependence...|$|R

5|$|Rough seas {{offshore}} Odisha caused two fishing trawlers <b>to</b> <b>collide,</b> {{resulting in}} 18fatalities, while two additional trawlers were reported missing. In West Bengal, the storm uprooted trees and dropped heavy rainfall. Throughout India, 124deaths were confirmed. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Bangladesh impacted many cities and villages, including {{the capital city}} of Dhaka, forcing thousands to evacuate. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank offshore Bangladesh, with only 11reaching safety. Eight additional boats with 60occupants were reported missing. One death was reported in Bangladesh after a man attempted to cross a swollen river. Overall, there were 49fatalities in Bangladesh. The storm was attributed to at least 173fatalities in India, Bangladesh, and offshore areas.|$|E

5|$|Triton's orbit upon capture {{would have}} been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic {{perturbations}} in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> and reduce to a disc of rubble. This means {{it is likely that}} Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons. This great perturbation may possibly be the reason why the satellite system of Neptune does not follow the 10,000:1 ratio of mass between the parent planet and all its moons seen in the satellite systems of all the other giant planets.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it {{on a collision course with}} Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} approached, {{residents}} of low-lying areas were advised to seek shelter. According to the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the communication system had been activated and collectors in coastal districts were given satellite telephones. Additionally, district authorities collected food, water, and other essential emergency supplies. Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two trawlers <b>to</b> <b>collide,</b> resulting in 18fatalities; {{their bodies were}} later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional trawlers were reported missing. Nine fishing trawlers sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66fishermen accounted for. Initially, as many as 600were estimated to have been missing, though 250people swam back to Digha, where most of them received treatment at either a medical clinic or a hospital. According to the Chief Minister of West Bengal, 111people were still missing offshore West Bengal by late on November12. Forty-nine fatalities were confirmed offshore India, while two deaths occurred inland in West Bengal. Later, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters raised the death toll to 124.|$|E
