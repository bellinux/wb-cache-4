40|$|Eight {{selective}} surveillance {{methods were}} assessed for their effectiveness in detecting hospital infection {{and the time}} required for data collection. The methods were compared with a reference method {{which was designed to}} identify all patients and infections in the study population (patients occupying 122 beds of a district general hospital). The selective methods were: - laboratory based ward surveillance - laboratory based telephone surveillance - ward liaison surveillance - laboratory based ward liaison surveillance - risk factor surveillance - temperature chart surveillance - <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance - temperature and <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance. The proportions of community acquired infection (CAI) and hospital acquired infection (HAI) detected by the selective surveillance methods varied; the highest proportion of CAI (70 %) was identified by <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance, and temperature and <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance, and of HAI (71 %), detected by laboratory based ward liaison surveillance. The time for data collection ranged from 1. 5 hours/ 122 beds/week for laboratory based telephone surveillance to almost 8 hours for temperature and <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> surveillance. The time for the reference method was 22. 1 hours/ 122 beds/week. Using the proportion of patients with HAI detected and time required for data collection to assess the methods, laboratory based ward liaison surveillance was the most effective and an efficient method. This method was revised minimally and introduced into six district general hospitals by infection control nurses. The time for data collection ranged from 4 to almost 8 hours/ 120 beds/week. The revision did not affect the proportion of HAI detected, however, the proportion of CAI identified was significantly reduced. The reproducibility of laboratory based ward liaison surveillance was good. The results will enable infection control teams to make an objective and rational choice of methods for the surveillance of hospital infection...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to audit current {{practices}} on oxygen prescription in the Emergency Department (ED), and on accurate oxygen administration in the wards of Mater Dei Hospital. Method: Two hundred and forty eight adult patients attending the ED with diagnoses most likely to require oxygen therapy (mainly cardio-respiratory conditions) were randomly selected during 5 winter weeks. Data were collected on oxygen saturation, arterial blood gases, oxygen administration at the ED, oxygen prescription and its documentation, and oxygen administration in wards. The z-test was used to assess statistical significance of results and Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the effect of oxygen prescription documentation in <b>treatment</b> <b>charts.</b> Results: Oxygen <b>treatment</b> was indicated in 85 of the 248 patients. Of these, documented oxygen administration at the ED was only present in 23. 5 % (p< 0. 0001). Formal instructions on oxygen use were documented in 85. 9 % (p< 0. 0001), however in 51. 8 % of these there were incomplete details. Only 7. 1 % of patients in whom oxygen treatment was prescribed received oxygen therapy in the wards according to instructions (p< 0. 0001). It was also found that documenting oxygen prescription in <b>treatment</b> <b>charts</b> made no significant difference to the number of patients who actually received oxygen correctly in the ward. Conclusion: This study shows that there is need for better prescription, documentation and administration of oxygen in our hospital. Introduction of simple standardized oxygen charts may ensure that oxygen prescription and monitoring in the ED is carried out properly and that these instructions are then faithfully carried out in our wards...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{reliable}} tool for daily mental status classification in intensive care unit (ICU) patients for research purposes. Secondly, to identify patients with single, 1 -day episodes of delirium and to compare them with patients having more delirium days or episodes. Patients and methods: A 5 -step algorithm was designed, which includes Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU scores from bedside nurses, initiation of delirium <b>treatment,</b> <b>chart</b> review, and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU administered by researchers. This algorithm was validated against a reference standard of delirium experts. Subsequently, a cohort study was performed in patients admitted to a mixed ICU. Results: In 65 paired observations, the algorithm had 0. 75 sensitivity and 0. 85 specificity. Applying the algorithm, interobserver agreement was high with mean Fleiss κ of 0. 94 (5 raters) and 0. 97 (4 raters). In the cohort study, 1112 patients were included of whom 535 (48 %) became delirious. Single, 1 -day episodes occurred in 43 % of the delirious patients, whom were characterized by lower age compared with those with more delirium days. Conclusions: The algorithm for daily mental status classification seems to be a valid tool.

Purpose: To assess the potential alteration of the frequency of errors {{associated with the use}} of RVS during radiation treatment delivery. Materials and methods: The software of the RVS was altered in order to record the settings actually used for radiation treatment delivery whereas the verification function was suppressed. At the end of the study period, the settings used during daily administration of radiation treatment were compared to the parameters recorded in the RVS using the computer. They were also compared with the planned ones written in the patient <b>treatment</b> <b>chart.</b> Results: Out of the 147 476 parameters examined during the study period, 678 (0. 46 %) were set erroneously. At least one error occurred in 628 (3. 22 %) of the 19 512 treated fields. An erroneous parameter was introduced in the RVS memory in 22 (1. 17 %) of the 1885 fields. Conclusions: RVS has the potential to improve precision of radiation treatment delivery by detecting a significant number of setting errors. However, excessive confidence in RVS could lead to repeated errors as there is a potential for the entry of erroneous parameters into the RVS memory. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Twenty-eight health care workers and 204 children were studied. A univariate analysis revealed the following significant predictors of correct treatment, {{as defined by the}} Central African malaria control program: high fever (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 25, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 1. 47, 7. 17); correct health care worker diagnosis (OR = 2. 59, 95 % Cl: 1. 39, 4. 85); and the caregiver's reporting the child's fever to the health care worker (OR = 2. 18, 95 % Cl: 1. 32, 3. 62). There was an unexpected inverse association between the presence of a fever <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> and correct treatment (OR = 0. 19, 95 % Cl: 0. 04, 0. 91). Correct treatment was marginally associated with a longer consultation time (p value for trend = 0. 058).

40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{effects of}} Shockwave {{lithotripsy}} (SWL) are unknown; however, we recently found {{an association between}} SWL and diabetes mellitus in a population based case control cohort. To further study the association between SWL and diabetes mellitus, we determined the immediate impact of SWL on the pancreas {{as well as the}} long-term natural history of stone disease following <b>treatment.</b> <b>Chart</b> review identified 630 patients treated with SWL at our institution in 1985. Questionnaires focusing on recurrent stone episodes after SWL were sent to 578 patients alive in 2004. To further assess impact of SWL on the pancreas, pancreatic enzyme measurements were performed on 24 symptomatic stone patients treated in 2006 with ureteroscopy (n= 12) and SWL (n= 12). Serum amylase and lipase were evaluated pre and post SWL. A> 5 U/L increase in either lab value was considered significant. Among patients in the long-term SWL treatment group, the questionnaire response rate was 58. 9 % (288 / 489). Recurrent stone events were noted in 154 (53. 5 %) of the survey respondents. Characteristics associated with stone recurrences were: gender (p= 0. 004), age at SWL (p= 0. 022), BMI (p= 0. 007), SWL complications (p= 0. 009), and lower pole SWL (p= 0. 025). Recurrent stone disease was also associated with the development of diabetes mellitus (p= 0. 020). In the contemporary group of treated stone patients, pancreatic enzyme analysis demonstrated an increase in serum amylase and lipase in 3 (25. 0 %) SWL patients and 1 (8. 3 %) ureteroscopy patient (p= 0. 273). In conclusion, over half of the patients treated with SWL will develop recurrent stone events. We found a strong association between recurrent stone disease and the development of diabetes mellitus at long-term follow-up. Although not statistically significant due to small number, data in a contemporary treatment cohort suggest the possibility that the pancreas can be adversely affected by SWL...|$|E
40|$|Retinal {{photography}} and angiography {{is the process}} of documenting a person 2 ̆ 7 s retina, the inside lining of the eye, using a specially designed camera. Traditionally, these images have been recorded on both color slide and black and white film. Recent technological advances in electronic /digital imaging have led to new means of recording these retinal images. These images may be viewed on a computer monitor, but typically these images are printed to a high resolution /addressability output device. By utilizing a high resolution /addressability ink jet printer {{it may be possible to}} produce output of these images at a quality equal to those produced by a dye sublimation printer. This thesis project investigates the possibility that a 720 x 720 dots per inch ink jet printer can be used as an alternative to a far more expensive 300 dots per inch black and white dye sublimation printer. A total of two different retinal angiograms were printed on each device. The standard output from the dye sublimation printer was judged with three different substrates from the ink jet printer, plain paper, coated paper, and photographic quality paper. Each angiogram has four separate pages. These pages are 8. 5 inches x 11 inches with 1, 4, 9, and 16 images per page. Each page was printed on the follow substrates: Kodak Ektatherm print paper, Hammermill plain paper, Canon HR 101 high resolution paper, and Kodak Photographic Quality Ink Jet Paper. The study involved visual evaluation of the images by fifteen ophthalmologists experienced at looking at and interpreting angiograms. Under standard /normal viewing conditions, the fifteen judges compared the four pages (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) generated from the Kodak dye sublimation printer and the identical images printed on the Canon BJC 620 ink jet printer on the three different substrates. They judged each series and rated each output acceptable or unacceptable for use in the following areas: diagnosis and <b>treatment,</b> <b>chart</b> copy, and referral copy. Their evaluations were recorded using a response sheet. The results of this experiment are be shown as a percentage of acceptable or unacceptable for each substrate and image layout (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the rate and the predictors of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with T 1 mi breast cancer. Methods: We analyzed 62 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion, and the pathology records and <b>treatment</b> <b>charts</b> were retrospectively reviewed for information on the patient and tumor characteristics. All the included patients underwent breast conserving surgery and 48 patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Results: The incidence of axillary involvement was 8. 3 %. Comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (P 0. 031), histologic grade 3 (P 0. 025), the presence of necrosis (P 0. 007) and Van Nuys group 3 (P 0. 025) were significant predictors of axillary involvement on the statistical analysis. Axillary dissection was significantly associated with the occurrence of arm lymphedema (P 0. 030). Conclusions: A significant rate of axillary metastases occurred in the patients with T 1 mi breast carcinoma in this study. The comedo subtype of ductal carcinoma in situ, a high histo-logic grade, the presence of necrosis and the Van Nuys group 3 were significant predictors of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with T 1 mi breast cancer. Thus, the patients with T 1 mi breast disease are indicated to a careful evaluation of axillary lymph node metastasis, if they have the earlier-mentioned unfavorable factors.

40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHIn Zambia, {{there had}} been a large scaling up of new {{interventions}} to control malaria since 2003, which included the distribution of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), used to immediately determine if someone with symptoms suggestive of malaria actually has malaria; training of health workers {{in the use of the}} RDTs; and the prescription of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to which the malaria parasite is sensitive, rather than the old treatment regime of chloroquine to which the malaria parasite had become resistant. The use of RDTs to confirm the presence of malaria before treating for it with ACT became known as the „test and treat‟ policy. Previously, since the 1960 s, in malaria endemic areas such as Zambia, children presenting with fever (the commonest symptom of malaria) without any obvious other cause for the fever, were assumed to have malaria and were hence treated for it with chloroquine. This was known as "presumptive treatment" of malaria. The combination of "presumptive treatment" and the use of a single medication led to the development of high levels of resistance to chloroquine, to the extent that it is now no longer an effective treatment for malaria. Years after the introduction of the "test and treat" policy, it was still unclear to what extent it was being implemented, as there was initial reluctance by health workers to test all children presenting with fever for malaria and if they did test they may not have followed the management guidelines of treating those who test positive with ACT and further investigating those who test negative for the cause of the fever. It seemed that staff had gotten used to the "presumptive treatment" approach to malaria over almost 4 decades and hence were quite reluctant to abandon it. The conflicting guidelines for malaria treatment in children between IMCI and "test and treat‟ has promoted a paradox between presumptive treatment for malaria and "test and treat" approach as IMCI teaches health workers to treat febrile children presumptively for malaria whereas the "test and treat" approach requires them to first make a definitive diagnosis before treating. Hence although the "test and treat" approach was instituted to overcome the problems with presumptive treatment approach it now had to contend with the competing and contradictory influence of the IMCI approach. This study therefore aimed to assess what proportion of children aged five years and younger who presented with fever were managed via the "test and treat" guidelines and which factors were associated with this, in Lusaka District, Zambia. Methodology: A cross sectional analytical study design was used based on a review of medical records. A sample size of 800 medical records of children presenting with fever was selected from 10 out of the 23 health care facilities in Lusaka, using a multistage stratified random sampling technique. Four hundred records were sampled from 2008 records (five years after commencement of the "test and treat" policy) and 400 from 2011 records (eight years after commencement of the "test and treat" policy). Trained data collectors used a data extraction tool to transcribe demographic and clinical data from the medical records in a standardized manner. Data Analysis: Univariate descriptive statistics analysis was performed using measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion to analyze numerical (continuous) variables such as age, weight and body temperature; and using frequencies for categorical variables such as gender, area of residence, RDTs/microscopy malaria tests conducted, received ACT if RDT positive, presence of an ACT <b>treatment</b> <b>chart</b> on the health centre wall and availability of a weighing scale. To determine the relationship between variables, bivariate analysis via the prevalence ratio was conducted. Results: Just over half (55 %) of all children with fever were tested for malaria in 2008 and this gratifyingly increased to (73 %) in 2011. Overall, the proportion of children correctly and appropriately treated with ACT, which means that those who tested positive for malaria were given ACT, was 85 % in 2008 but regrettably dropped to 72 % in 2011. Although "presumptive treatment" decreased from 24 % in 2008 to 11 % in 2011, the proportion of children with fever not tested for malaria, and although not treated for malaria, but left without a definitive diagnosis of their fever being made, remained high but dropping (22 % in 2008 and 16 % in 2011). Similarly the proportion of children who tested negative for malaria but then did not undergo any further investigation also unfortunately remained very high and rising (57 % in 2008 and 89 % in 2011). A combination of the above poor clinical management practises resulted in only 38 % of children with fever in 2008 and unfortunately dropping to only 33 % in 2011 being correctly managed (tested for malaria via RDT or microscopy and treated with ACT if positive, while further investigated for the cause of fever if negative). On preparedness of the health facility to implement the "test and treat" policy, it was noted that only 4 out of 10 health facilities were at least minimally prepared to do so, but paradoxically on bivariate analysis those minimally prepared were less likely (PR 0. 62; 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 94) to correctly manage the patients in 2011 than those who were unprepared. A similar paradox occurred for those correctly treated with ACT after testing positive, with facilities which were minimally prepared being less likely to do so (PR 0. 28; 95 % CI 0. 14 - 0. 58) in 2011 than those facilities which were unprepared to implement the "test and treat" policy. However these associations were inconsistent over time, as the associations were not present in 2008. Similarly all other factors such as staff category (doctor, nurse, clinical officer) and type of presenting symptoms besides fever (anorexia, lethargy, pallor) assessed, were not consistently associated with testing for malaria in both 2008 and 2011. The same applied for the other two main outcome variables of 'treated with ACT after test positive for malaria' and 'correctly managed child with fever', in that there were no factors that showed a consistent association with them in both 2008 and 2011. Conclusion: Testing of children with fever for malaria is at a low level but rose between 2008 and 2011. Paradoxically the proportion of those diagnosed with malaria who were correctly treated with ACT dropped between 2008 and 2011, as did the proportion of children with fever who were correctly managed. No factors assessed in this study were found to be consistently associated in both 2008 and 2011 with either testing for malaria, or treating confirmed malaria cases with ACT, or managing patients with fever correctly. Recommendations: In order for health workers to correctly implement the "test and treat" policy, which involves a series of complex steps, they ought to be formally trained to do so, mentored and constructively supervised. Additionally health facilities should be adequately equipped to enable health workers to fully implement the policy. Further studies to assess factors associated with the correct management of malaria via the "test and treat" policy are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : The {{overwhelming}} {{numbers of}} twins following assisted reproductive technology (ART) are dichorionic twins, but monochorionic twins account for around 0. 9 % of post ART pregnancies. The data for post ART-monochorionic pregnancy outcomes are scarce {{due to the}} rarity of this condition. Hence, we evaluated the obstetric outcomes of monochorionic and dichorionic pregnancies conceived on ART. Settings : University teaching hospital. Study Design : A case-control study of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) and dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) pregnancies conceived following ART <b>treatment.</b> <b>Charts</b> of all women who conceived following ART from 2008 to 2013 were screened. Among them, the monochorionic twins diagnosed in the first trimester were included and their obstetric outcome was followed-up. For comparison, {{an equal number of}} dichorionic twin pregnancies from age and body mass index matched mothers was selected. Results : The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. MCDA group had a higher miscarriage rate (50 %) than the DCDA group (10 %), with three seconds trimester miscarriages in the MCDA group. The live birth rates were lower in the MCDA versus DCDA group (40 % vs. 90 %). Among triplet pregnancies with a monochorionic component, the live birth rate was only 25 %. Conclusions : Monochorionic pregnancies following ART have poorer obstetric outcomes when compared to dichorionic pregnancies. For monochorionic pregnancies following ART, intensive antenatal surveillance at a tertiary level obstetric and neonatal center may help optimize the outcome...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the nature and}} types of medication errors (MEs), to evaluate occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and assess rationality of prescription orders in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational {{study was conducted in}} General Medicine and Pediatric ward of Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad during October 2012 to January 2014. MEs were categorized as prescription error, dispensing error, and administration error (AE). The case records and <b>treatment</b> <b>charts</b> were reviewed. The investigator also accompanied the staff nurse during the ward rounds and interviewed patients or care taker to gather information, if necessary. DDIs were assessed by Medscape Drug Interaction Checker software (version 4. 4). Rationality of prescriptions was assessed using Phadke′s criteria. Results: A total of 1109 patients (511 in Medicine and 598 in Pediatric ward) were included during the study period. Total number of MEs was 403 (36 %) of which, 195 (38 %) were in Medicine and 208 (35 %) were in Pediatric wards. The most common ME was PEs 262 (65 %) followed by AEs 126 (31 %). A potential significant DDIs were observed in 191 (17 %) and serious DDIs in 48 (4 %) prescriptions. Majority of prescriptions were semirational 555 (53 %) followed by irrational 317 (30 %), while 170 (17 %) prescriptions were rational. Conclusion: There is a need to establish ME reporting system to reduce its incidence and improve patient care and safety...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Adult medulloblastoma (AMB) {{is a rare}} {{central nervous}} system tumor. We aimed to analyze the {{treatment}} outcomes of AMB treated at our institute with surgery followed by craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the <b>treatment</b> <b>charts</b> of 31 patients of AMB treated from 2003 - 2011. The patient demography, treatment details and survival data were collected in a predesigned proforma. Kaplan Meier method was used to analyze disease free survival (DFS) {{and the impact of}} prognostic factors was determined by univariate analysis (log rank test). Results: Male: Female ratio was 21 : 10. Cerebrospinal fluid dissemination was noted in 16 % cases. CSI (36 Gray at 1. 8 Gray/fraction to entire neuraxis and 20 Gray at 2 Gray/fraction boost to posterior fossa) was used in all cases. 26 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin plus etoposide). Median follows up was 26. 85 months (9. 47 - 119. 73 months). The estimated 3 and 5 years DFS was found to be 84. 9 % and 50. 7 % respectively. On univariate analysis, tumor located laterally had a trend towards better DFS (HR 3. 04; 95 %CI 0. 722 to 12. 812; P = 0. 07) compared to midline tumors. Other factors like adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, surgical extent had no statistically significant impact on survival. Conclusion: The results of our study (largest series from India) show that the regimen of surgery, adjuvant CSI and chemotherapy is feasible and confers descent survival. AMB patients should be treated with a multimodality approach in a tertiary care centre...|$|R
40|$|Background: Palliative {{radiotherapy}} (PRT) plays {{a significant}} role in the palliation of symptoms in patients with cancer and constitutes nearly 50 % of the workload in different settings. Aims: The aim is to study patient-, disease-, and treatment-related characteristics in locoregionally advanced and metastatic malignancies meriting palliative management. Setting and Design: This was a retrospective observational study in a tertiary care government institute with academic and research potential. Methodology: The electronic medical records, medical documents, and radiotherapy (RT) <b>treatment</b> <b>charts</b> were retrieved and studied. Observations: A total of 460 patients were included in the study over 2 years, forming 30 % of the total number of patients treated during the study period. Three hundred and ninety-six patients received PRT to the metastatic sites, while 64 patients received extremely hypofractionated PRT to the primary for symptomatic relief. Totally 442 patients showed good symptomatic response to PRT. One hundred and thirty-eight patients underwent re-irradiation. Lung was the most common primary site seen in 155 cases. The most common indication for PRT was palliation of pain from painful metastases as seen in 240 cases, and the next common indication was palliative whole-brain RT for brain metastases as seen in 159 cases. Conclusion: PRT forms an integral and important aspect of palliative care to the vast number of patients harboring metastatic disease that warrants some form of treatment for symptomatic relief. Short course of PRT in outdoor setting is a preferred mode of treatment to improve the quality of life of these distressed patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: TNF-α inhibitors are potent {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs that}} have revolutionized {{the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a non-invasive method to study cartilage quality, in particular the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. PURPOSE: To evaluate knee cartilage quality before and after treatment with a TNF-α inhibitor (infliximab) in patients with RA using dGEMRIC and to study clinical parameters and serum cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) after the same treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seven patients with chronic RA received infusions of 3 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22. Clinical examination, serum COMP level, and dGEMRIC scans (1. 5 T) were performed at baseline and after 7 months. The dGEMRIC index (ms), reflecting cartilage GAG content, was calculated using an inversion recovery sequence in the femoral weight-bearing cartilage. Seven years after <b>treatment,</b> <b>charts</b> were reviewed regarding joint replacement surgery (TKA). RESULTS: Clinical parameters showed an improvement for all patients after the 7 -month treatment period. Serum COMP decreased from 13 ± 4. 5 to 11 ± 3. 4 (μg, mean ± SD) μg/ml (P< 0. 05). The dGEMRIC index was lower at follow-up than at baseline, 332 ± 85 and 382 ± 69 (ms, mean ± SD), respectively (P< 0. 05), indicating loss of GAG. The two patients with the lowest dGEMRIC index had received a TKA 7 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: This longitudinal study indicates a substantial GAG loss from the knee cartilage matrix in patients with chronic RA. Treatment with infliximab {{does not seem to}} protect the cartilage from further deterioration despite improvements in clinical parameters and decreased serum COMP...|$|R
