50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Glimcher was an {{orthopedic}} surgeon at Mass General. At 39, Dr. Glimcher {{was appointed to the}} first tenured chair in orthopedic surgery at Harvard. He also headed the amputee clinic at the Liberty Mutual Insurance (now Liberty Mutual Group), Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and found that individuals with transradial amputations were using prostheses to recoup much more of their lost functioning than were individuals with <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputations.</b> His frustration with existing devices for transhumeral amputees led him to put together a group of institutions to develop a myoelectric elbow. The first Boston Arm was a joint effort of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Research Institute for Safety, MIT, HMS, and Mass General to rehabilitate persons who had suffered upper-limb loss.|$|R
40|$|Surgical implantations of osseointegrated {{fixations}} for bone-anchored prosthesis {{are developing}} at an unprecedented pace worldwide while initial skepticism in the orthopedic community is slowly fading away. Clearly, this option is becoming accessible {{to a wide}} range of individuals with limb loss.

40|$|Background: This article {{reports a}} rare and {{inspirational}} case of a four-limb amputee, the range of integrated technology solutions that enable {{him to be a}} productive member of his family and the process and pitfalls of seeking technology solutions. Case description and methods: A complex case of bilateral <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation</b> and bilateral transfemoral amputation with residual upper limbs too short to oppose is presented. The multiple ‘high-tech’ and ‘low-tech’ devices used on a daily basis to move around his house and community, control his environment, communicate and feed himself without the use of limbs, prostheses or a second person are outlined. Findings and outcomes: Recent advances in electronics, computing and telecommunications technologies provide him with capabilities not possible 10 [*]years ago. Conclusion: The process and pitfalls in sourcing technology solutions and the innovative solutions to meet the unique functional needs of this individual provide guidance to those with similarly severe and profound limitations to independence.

40|$|Upper-limb {{amputation}} {{can cause}} {{a great deal of}} functional impairment for patients, particularly for those with amputation at or above the elbow. Our long-term objective is to improve functional outcomes for patients with amputation by integrating a fully implanted electromyographic (EMG) recording system with a wireless telemetry system that communicates with the patient's prosthesis. We believe that this should generate a scheme that will allow patients to robustly control multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the feasibility of predicting dynamic arm movements (both flexion/extension and pronation/supination) based on EMG signals from a set of muscles that would likely be intact in patients with <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation.</b> We recorded movement kinematics and EMG signals from seven muscles during a variety of movements with different complexities. Time-delayed artificial neural networks were then trained offline to predict the measured arm trajectories based on features extracted from the measured EMG signals. We evaluated the relative effectiveness of various muscle subsets. Predicted movement trajectories had average root-mean-square errors of approximately 15. 7 ° and 24. 9 ° and average R 2 values of approximately 0. 81 and 0. 46 for elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are no commercially {{available}} externally-powered humeral rotators. This paper describes {{the development of}} a new powered-humeral rotator based on an LTI Boston Elbow II drive train suitable for use on persons with short <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputations</b> or shoulder disarticulation amputations. An initial fitting of the device as part of a six motor arm demonstrated the efficacy of the device and anecdotal evidence suggested the patient found the device to be of benefit. Introduction: It is estimated that out of a total of about 100, 000 upper-limb amputees in the USA that about 18 % have trans-humeral amputations or higher [Laplante & Carlson, 1997; Millstein et al., 1985; 1986]. For the upper arm the normal range-of-motion for humeral rotation is 90 ° of medial (inward-towards the midline) humeral rotation and 40 ° of lateral (outward-away from the midline) humeral rotation. However, persons with high-level arm amputations (trans...|$|R
40|$|Background: The osseointegration {{programme}} for {{upper extremity}} amputation started in Sweden in 1990, when a titanium fixture was first implanted into a thumb. This method {{has since been}} used for <b>transhumeral</b> and below-elbow <b>amputation.</b> The treatment involves two surgical procedures. During the first a titanium fixture is surgically attached to the skeleton, and a second procedure six months later involves a skin penetrating abutment to which the prosthesis is attached. Objectives: To describe the osseointegration procedure for surgery, prosthetics and rehabilitation. Methods: Patients with short stumps and previous problems with prosthetic fitting were selected. From 1990 to April 2010, 37 upper limb cases were treated and fitted with prosthesis: 10 thumbs, 1 partial hand, 10 transradial and 16 <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputations.</b> Of these, 7 patients are currently not prosthetic users. Results: Patients indicated that function {{and quality of life}} had improved since osseointegration. Conclusion: Osseointegration is an important platform for present and future prosthetic technology. The prosthetic situation is improved due to the stable fixation, freedom of motion and functionality. Clinical relevance The two-stage osseointegration procedure has the potential to change the rehabilitation strategy for selected upper limb amputees. The method eliminates the need for a socket and the prosthesis will always fit. The stable prosthetic fixation and increased freedom of motion generates improved function. Specially designed components and rehabilitation pro-cedures have been developed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the use of 3 D motion capture data to create and {{optimize}} a robotic human body model (RHBM) to predict the inverse kinematics of the upper body. The RHBM is a 25 degrees of freedom (DoFs) upper body model with subject specific kinematic parameters. The model was developed to predict the inverse kinematics of the upper body in the simulation of a virtual person, including persons with functional limitations such as a transradial or <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation.</b> Motion data were collected from 14 subjects: 10 non-amputees control subjects, 1 person with a transradial amputation, and 3 persons with a <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation,</b> in the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s (USF) motion analysis laboratory. Motion capture for each subject consisted of the repetition of a series of range of motion (RoM) tasks and activities of daily living (ADLs), which were recorded using an eight camera Vicon (Oxford, UK) motion analysis system. The control subjects were also asked to repeat the motions while wearing a brace on their dominant arm. The RoM tasks consisted of elbow flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, forearm pronation 2 ̆ 6 supination, shoulder flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, shoulder abduction 2 ̆ 6 adduction, shoulder rotation, torso flexion 2 ̆ 6 extension, torso lateral flexion, and torso rotation. The ADLs evaluated were brushing one 2 ̆ 7 s hair, drinking from a cup, eating with a knife and fork, lifting a laundry basket, and opening a door. The impact of bracing and prosthetic devices on the subjects 2 ̆ 7 RoM, and their motion during ADLs was analyzed. The segment geometries of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 upper body were extracted directly from the motion analysis data using a functional joint center method. With this method there are no conventional or segment length differences between recorded data segments and the RHBM. This ensures the accuracy of the RHBM when reconstructing a recorded task, as the model has the same geometry as the recorded data. A detailed investigation of the weighted least norm, probability density gradient projection method, artificial neural networks was performed to optimize the redundancy RHBM inverse kinematics. The selected control algorithm consisted of a combination of the weighted least norm method and the gradient projection of the null space, minimizing the inverse of the probability density function. This method increases the accuracy of the RHBM while being suitable {{for a wide range of}} tasks and observing the required subject constraint inputs...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Prostheses for upper-limb amputees are {{currently}} controlled by either myoelectric or peripheral neural signals. Performance and dexterity {{of these devices}} is still limited, {{particularly when it comes}} to controlling hand function. Movement-related brain activity might serve as a complementary bio-signal for motor control of hand prosthesis. Methods: We introduced a methodology to implant a cortical interface without direct exposure of the brain surface in an upper-limb amputee. This bi-directional interface enabled us to explore the cortical physiology following long-term <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation.</b> In addition, we investigated neurofeedback of electrocorticographic brain activity related to the patient’s motor imagery to open his missing hand, i. e. phantom hand movement, for real-time control of a virtual hand prosthesis. Results: Both event-related brain potentials and cortical stimulation revealed mutually overlapping cortical representations of the phantom hand. Phantom hand movements could be robustly classified and the patient required only three training sessions to gain reliable control of the virtual hand prosthesis in an online closed-loop paradigm that discriminated between hand opening and rest. Conclusion: Epidural implants may constitute a powerful and safe alternative communication pathway between the brain and external devices for upper-limb amputees, thereby facilitating the integrated use of different signal sources for more intuitive and specific control of multi-functional devices in clinical use. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{gentleman in}} this case study {{presents}} with the typical etiology of a brachial plexus injury, status post motorcycle accident. The accident occurred several years ago with surgical intervention including a shoulder allograft and arthrodesis {{as well as a}} transradial amputation. Because of the presence of a complete brachial plexus injury it is difficult to decipher the rationale behind a transradial amputation. Many of us have fit individuals who had suffered these type of injuries and have opted for <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputations.</b> Difficulty arises from attempting to accommodate the non-functional articulation, namely the elbowjoint. Past prosthetic fittings have been with a conventional, elbow disarticulation style prosthesis with external locking hinges and voluntary opening terminal device. Due to the limited excursion of this gentleman and his wear on the contralateral shoulder for these many years, it was time to consider a different prosthetic design The design consideration was to utilize some of the components that he presently functions with and to add electronic components which require limited excursion and strength in order to operate...|$|R

40|$|For {{people with}} digit amputations, {{prosthetic}} choices {{have been limited}} to cosmetic restorations usually made of silicone, opposition posts, or mechanical linkages. In a study in Australia, those with partial hand losses perceive themselves {{to be at a}} higher disability than those with unilateral transradial or <b>transhumeral</b> upper extremity <b>amputations.</b> More than half of partial hand amputees are unable to return to their previous work. Of those that did return to work, the majority did not find their prosthesis functional for work. Articulating partial hand prostheses have been available since at least the mid 1970 ’s, but have not largely been adopted due to limitations of fit or usefulness. Each year approximately 17, 000 digit amputations are performed in the United States. Between 2000 and 2010 it is estimated that within the Veterans’ Administration there were 3000 digit amputations. There are roughly 400 warriors with digit amputations attributable to operation OIF/OEF, and an estimated 50 with bilateral thumb loss. Improvement in the ability to carry out activities of daily living (ADL) using partial hand prostheses is evaluated in two case studies of subjects presenting with multiple-limb amputations. Impairment and disability are assessed using the quickDASH, the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test, and the Box and Blocks Test during initial visits and at follow-up visits after delivery of their prosthetic devices. Both of the subjects represent unique challenges for prosthetic fitting and have revealed unique outcomes in their abilities to utilize their partial hand prosthesis in ADLs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The AdVAntage ArmTM is an above-elbow (AE) body-powered arm {{designed}} to improve upon, and overcome, {{some of the major}} limitations of conventional prostheses. It is the result of research and development (R&D) accomplished at the Center for Engineering Design (CED), University of Utah and Sarcos Research Corporation (SRC), Salt Lake City, UT. The AdVAntage Arm was developed to provide the following main features: lightweight, independent elbow and terminal device (TD) control, and a cable recovery system for full TD actuation at any elbow position. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Rehab R&D Service's Technology Transfer Section (TTS), with collaboration from the VA National Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS), managed a multi-center clinical evaluation of the precommercial AdVAntage Arm (the Arm). The purpose was to objectively assess and affirm the Arm's functional advantages, reliability, clinical application, and commercial readiness. Eleven VA prosthetic services served as evaluation sites with a total of 16 subjects with amputation (14 unilateral and 2 bilateral). Fifteen prosthetists provided their comments. Overall, the results demonstrated that the Arm could be fit for use by persons with <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation.</b> Once the learning curve was overcome, the majority of subjects reported that the Arm offered several functional advantages over thei...|$|E
40|$|A {{firefighter}} with burn injuries demonstrated fitting challenges regarding {{comfort and}} suspension of a functional upper limb prosthesis. This case study introduces a transhumeral-transfemoral patient who was injured during a volunteer firefighting incident. The patient sustained several injuries {{which resulted in}} amputation of the right leg just proximal to the knee and a <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation</b> of the left upper limb. The patient has full range of motion in both shoulders and elbows, yet the strength and dexterity {{of his right hand}} has been compromised. This individual sustained burns to 60 % of his body, including the skin on his left transhumeral residual limb. Due to the delicate nature of his skin, a suction socket was contraindicated. Over the next four years, different types of custom and non-custom locking and cushion liners were utilized for patient comfort and suspension of both a myoelectric and a conventional (body-powered) prosthesis. The integration of electrodes for dual site myoelectric inputs offered additional challenges that compromised the suspension provided by silicone suction. Shuttle locks, lanyards, and proximal locking mechanisms were used, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each system will be compared. This case study will follow the progression of suspension techniques, interface designs, and other clinical challenges faced by the patient and the clinicians involved with the fitting. As the patient progresses toward his imminent evaluation for Targeted Muscle Reinnervation surgery, his existing design must be modified to allow additional EMG sites. The challenges of this firefighter’s progressive fitting and treatment will be detailed in the discussion...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in successful upper limb prostheses is the socket design. Sockets must be individually fabricated to arrive at a geometry that suits the user's morphology and appropriately distributes the pressures associated with prosthetic use across the residual limb. In higher levels of amputation, such as transhumeral, this challenge is amplified as prosthetic weight and the physical demands placed on the residual limb are heightened. Yet, in the upper limb, socket fabrication is largely driven by heuristic practices. An analytical understanding of the interactions between the socket and residual limb is absent in literature. This work describes techniques, adapted from lower limb prosthetic research, to empirically characterize the pressure distribution occurring between the residual limb and well-fit transhumeral prosthetic sockets. A case series analyzing the result of four participants with <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation</b> is presented. A Tekscan VersaTek pressure measurement system and FaroArm Edge coordinate measurement machine were employed to capture socket-residual limb interface pressures and geometrically register these values to the anatomy of participants. Participants performed two static poses with their prosthesis under two separate loading conditions. Surface pressure maps were constructed from the data, highlighting pressure distribution patterns, anatomical locations bearing maximum pressure, and the relative pressure magnitudes. Pressure distribution patterns demonstrated unique characteristics across the four participants that could be traced to individual socket design considerations. This work presents a technique that implements commercially available tools to quantitatively characterize upper limb socket-residual limb interactions. This is a fundamental first step toward improved socket designs developed through informed, analytically-based design tools...|$|E

Study purpose is to describe experiences of subjects with <b>transhumeral</b> <b>amputation</b> and brachial plexus injury, who were fit with, and trained to use, a DEKA Arm. This was a mixed-methods study utilizing qualitative (e. g. interview, survey) and quantitative data (e. g. self-report and performance measures). Subject 1, a current prosthesis user, had a shoulder arthrodesis. Subject 2, not a prosthesis user, had a subluxed shoulder. Both were trained in laboratory and participated in a trial of home use. Descriptive analyses of processes and outcomes were conducted. Subject 1 was fitted with the transhumeral configuration (HC) DEKA Arm using a compression release stabilized socket. He had 12 hours of prosthetic training and participated in all home study activities. Subject 1 had improved dexterity and prosthetic satisfaction with the DEKA Arm and reported {{better quality of life}} (QOL) at the end of participation. Subject 2 was fit with the shoulder configuration (SC) DEKA Arm using a modified X-frame socket. He had 30 hours of training and participated in 3 weeks of home activities. He reported less functional disability at the end of training as compared to baseline, but encountered personal problems and exacerbation of PTSD symptoms and withdrew from home use portion at 3 weeks. Both subjects reported functional benefits from use, and expressed a desire to receive a DEKA Arm in the future. This paper reported on two different strategies for prosthetic fitting and their outcomes. The advantages and limitations of each approach were discussed.
