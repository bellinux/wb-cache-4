5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he did to her. However, the relationship lasted and she began to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928. Throughout their marriage, his wife motivated him to continue his efforts to further his career and they remained close. Norma died two months after her husband in 1971.|$|E

In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an interest in literature than in music.|$|E
25|$|His bowling {{was quite}} {{impressive}} {{in his first}} seasons in first class cricket, as he burst onto the scene with six for 36 for Easterns against Griqualand West, but in the 2004/05 season {{he was expected to}} <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the bowling effort for the Titans, but took only 20 wickets at a bowling average of 40.65. However, that coincided with an improvement in his batting, as he made his first double century of his career, with 204 not out against Western Province Boland.|$|E

25|$|In Quinn's first start, the Irish were bolstered with Quinn's 297passing {{yards on}} 59attempts. However, Purdue's defense intercepted four of Quinn's passes and sacked him five times {{en route to}} a 23–10 Boilermaker victory. Quinn {{remained}} as the starter and, with Willingham's acknowledgment that the running game needed to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a role in the next game, got his first win against Pittsburgh. He was helped by Julius Jones' school-record 262rushing yards. Notre Dame lost their next three games, including Willingham's second straight 31point loss to USC, a last minute loss to Boston College, and their first home shutout since 1978 to Florida State. The Irish players began to call the season disappointing, as the team needed to win their last four games to make a bowl game. They looked to have a chance of becoming bowl eligible, as their next three games were a last minute win that improved their streak to 40games over Navy, a win on senior day over the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars, and a win over Stanford that saw the Irish offense finally connect in the season. Notre Dame lost their final game to Syracuse, however. With a 5–7 record, the Irish finished with the twelfth losing season {{in the history of the}} Notre Dame football program.|$|E

Dee Anthony pushed Marriott to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the on-stage spotlight, something he had, up to then, been sharing with Frampton and Ridley. Marriott's new prominence is said to have resulted in Frampton's decision to leave the band. (Frampton was replaced by Clem Clempson.) ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{many critics}} still {{consider}} the word [...] "beat" [...] in its literal sense of [...] "tired and beaten down," [...] others, including Kerouac himself promoted the generation more in sense of [...] "beatific" [...] or blissful. Holmes and Kerouac published several articles in popular magazines {{in an attempt}} to explain the movement. [...] In the November 16, 1952 New York Times Sunday Magazine, he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. [...] "ne day [...] said, 'You know, this is a really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw. [...] It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul: [...] a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness. [...] In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself." [...] He distinguishes Beats from the Lost Generation of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like Ernest Hemingway shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout On the Road he alludes to novels like The Sun Also Rises. [...] "How to live seems much more crucial than why." [...] In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life. [...] Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in Esquire magazine. This article was able to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after On the Road. [...] "It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions. [...] To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality, looking up." ...|$|E

60|$|And as {{the captain}} of a ship {{is bound to be}} the last man to leave his ship in case of wreck, and to share his last crust with the sailors in case of famine, so the manufacturer, in any {{commercial}} crisis or distress, is bound to take the suffering of it with his men, and even to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it for himself than he allows his men to feel; as a father would in a famine, shipwreck, or battle, sacrifice himself for his son.|$|E
60|$|The Crew were {{resolved}} to revenge the Blood of their Officers and Comrades the next Day, and were accordingly on the Point of Landing, when two Canoes came off with two Men bound, the pretended Authors of this Treason, without the King's Knowledge, who had sent 'em {{that they might}} receive the Punishment due to their Villany. The Johanna Men on Board were call'd for Interpreters, who having given this Account, added, that the King only sacrificed these Men, but {{that they should not}} believe him, for he certainly had given Orders for assassinating the Europeans; and the better Way was to kill all the Mohilians that came in the Canoes as well as the two Prisoners; go back to Johanna, <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their Countrymen, and give no Peace to Traytors; but Misson was for no such violent Measures, he was averse to every Thing that bore the Face of Cruelty and thought a bloody Revenge, if Necessity did not enforce it, spoke a groveling and timid Soul; he, therefore, sent those of the Canoes back, and bid them tell their King, if before the Evening he sent the Hostages agreed upon, he should give Credit to his Excuse, but if he did not, he should believe him the Author of the late vile Attempt on his Life.|$|E
6000|$|The evening {{passed by}} without any very pleasurable excitement, and I regret {{to say that}} the earl went fast to sleep in the drawing-room as soon as he had {{swallowed}} his cup of coffee. During dinner he had been very courteous to both his guests, but towards Eames he had used a good-humoured and, almost affectionate familiarity. He had quizzed him for having been found asleep under the tree, telling Crofts that he had looked very forlorn,--"So that I haven't a doubt about his being in love," [...] said the earl. And he had asked Johnny to tell the name of the fair one, bringing up the remnants of his half-forgotten classicalities to bear out the joke. [...] "If I am to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the severe Falernian," [...] said he, laying his hand on the decanter of port, [...] "I must know the lady's name. Whoever she be, I'm well sure you need not blush for her. What! you refuse to tell! Then I'll drink no more." [...] And so the earl had walked out of the dining-room; but not till he had perceived by his guest's cheeks that the joke had been too true to be pleasant. As he went, however, he leaned with his hand on Eames's shoulder, and the servants looking on saw that the young man was to be a favourite. [...] "He'll make him his heir," [...] said Vickers. [...] "I shouldn't wonder a bit if he don't make him his heir." [...] But to this the footman objected, endeavouring to prove to Mr Vickers that, in accordance with the law of the land, his lordship's second cousin, once removed, whom the earl had never seen, but whom he was supposed to hate, must be his heir. [...] "A hearl can never choose his own heir, like you or me," [...] said the footman, laying down the law. [...] "Can't he though really, now? That's very hard on him; isn't it?" [...] said the pretty housemaid. [...] "Psha," [...] said Vickers: [...] "you know nothing about it. My lord could make young Eames his heir to-morrow; that is, the heir of his property. He couldn't make him a hearl, because that must go to the heirs of his body. As to his leaving him the place here, I don't just know how that'd be; and I'm sure Richard don't." ...|$|E
