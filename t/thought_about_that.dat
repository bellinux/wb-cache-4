500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Andrew Marr asked Corbyn [...] "do you regard {{yourself}} as a Marxist?", Corbyn responded by saying: [...] "That {{is a very interesting}} question actually. I haven't <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> for a long time. I haven't really read as much of Marx as we should have done. I have read quite a bit but not that much." [...] Similarly, defending John McDonnell's statement that there is [...] "a lot to learn" [...] from Karl Marx's book Das Kapital, Corbyn described Marx as a [...] "great economist".|$|E

60|$|And yet again, similarly, {{but much}} more distinctly, they might take delight in the {{beautiful}} image of a god, because it gathered and perpetuated their <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> god; and yet never suppose, nor be capable of being deceived by any arguments into supposing, that the statue was the god.|$|R
6000|$|The merchant's {{heart beat}} fast, {{and his mind}} was full of bad <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> poor little baby. He would be godfather himself, he said, and he ordered a fine christening feast; so the child was brought and christened, and Mark was very {{friendly}} to its father. After the ceremony was over he took Ivan aside and said: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People don't go to Doug Lucie's {{plays to}} be tickled under the chin. In the Eighties, his {{poisonous}} and hilarious comedies Fashion and Progress gave us portraits of humanity that might prompt second <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> post-show drink with friends. 'A martini of gall and wormwood about the articulate classes' is how one critic described his style." [...] -- Sarah Hemming, The Independent (1992) ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Mary Wylie King {{was active}} in women's {{organizations}} of the church. She worked for many years as an enthusiastic member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was {{an active member of}} Eastern Star, being chaplain of that order for many years. She did not like staying home while Ward travelled, a fact which she mentioned repeatedly in her letters to him. Even so, she did serve as his [...] "manager" [...] under one spelling of her maiden name of [...] "M.B. Wylie". She served as the practice audience for his speeches. She edited and typed his letters, often serving as his [...] "emergency secretary". Some called her the [...] "Mother of Good Roads." [...] By all accounts, she was a very strong-willed woman, with a flair for the dramatic. Family members point to the photo she had taken of herself in [...] "widow's weeds" [...] as an example of her endearing way of dramatizing events—in that case, the recent death of her husband. She also never lost her staunch devotion to the cause of temperance, which the repeal of Prohibition did nothing to dampen. One family member reported that {{there was a time when}} she came upon another family member having a beer. After she finished telling him in no uncertain terms what she <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> the two of them remained thereafter permanently estranged. However, she and Ward, the great promoter of his world changing invention, were undoubtedly the perfect pair.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Stewart commented <b>about</b> {{his second}} <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{quotation}} in 1981. [...] "In a way I regret having said what I said about obscenity—that's {{going to be}} on my tombstone. When I remember all of the other solid words I've written," [...] he said, [...] "I regret a little bit that if I'll be remembered at all I'll be remembered for that particular phrase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you thought}} so! Really! Kind {{of you to}} think so. And have you just <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> those <b>that</b> are coming, or have you made sure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I hadn't <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>that</b> yet." [...] He felt guilty, and was profusely cordial to Lee Theresa Zapp, {{the factory}} forewoman, {{who had just}} thumped down-stairs.|$|R

50|$|Prompted by {{the gift}} of a baby journal, Jenna begins to keep a diary, ostensibly for her unborn child, with voiceovers giving the viewer access to her <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> future child and her own plans. Between these entries, her {{relationship}} with Dr. Pomatter, and the thoughts she reveals as she describes the various pies she creates, the audience gets to know her evolving hopes and dreams, concerns and fears, and slowly growing attachment to the baby she at first didn't want.|$|R
50|$|I {{am trying}} {{to write about the}} state of my soul, for it is right for an old man to make his soul, and some of my <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> subject I have put into a poem called 'Sailing to Byzantium'. When Irishmen were {{illuminating}} the Book of Kells, and making the jeweled croziers in the National Museum, Byzantium was the centre of European civilization and the source of its spiritual philosophy, so I symbolize the search for the spiritual life by a journey to that city.|$|R
40|$|Overview: With {{preparations}} for the Defence White Paper 2015 well underway, both government and the public are probably more interested than usual in the esoteric topic of Australia’s strategic policy. In this paper, the author unpacks some <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> by talking most about how strategic policy is—ideally—made. Making strategic policy means solving a puzzle in three parts: understanding an environment largely not of our own making; determining our own global and regional role; and acknowledging a set of constraints that bound that role...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Dr. Martineau. [...] "Oddly enough, I {{have never}} <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} before. At least, not from this angle." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I cannot say {{it quite}} right,' {{answered}} the boy; 'I only know {{it says that}} the Angels in Heaven rejoice and are glad over one sinner <b>that</b> repenteth. I <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> night after I had been naughty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{hear the}} young girls talking about the colour of Cuchullain's [...] eyes, & how they have seven colours, I have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> [...] young man has Aoife's face and hair, but he has Cuchullain's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it any <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> George <b>that</b> {{makes you}} say so, child?' Michel {{paused a moment}} for an answer. 'Tell me,' he continued, with almost angry energy, 'is it because of George that you refuse {{yourself}} to this young man?' ...|$|R

60|$|No. I had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{while we}} had been there side by side. No. Apart from any inclinations of my own, I {{understood}} Wemmick's hint now. I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly," [...] replied Harold, laughing; [...] "but I have {{frequently}} {{thought of the}} scoundrel, and wondered where he is and what doing now. I have sometimes <b>thought</b> too, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> girl Azinte, poor thing. She--" ...|$|R

40|$|Some tout parental {{school choice}} as a {{strategy}} for promoting, among other school-related goods, educational innovation. This Article offers clarifying and skeptical <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> position. It first explains what “educational innovation” and “parental choice” mean. It then considers what limitations on this strategy might arise from existing legal regulations, from market forces, or from ethical obligations to children. Finally, the Article explains why parental choice is also unlikely to improve education for the children {{most in need of}} a better academic environment and suggests an alternative approach to student reassignment that is much more likely to do so...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is very fine, Charles, {{but what}} will be <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> when I make it all public in my own defence? How can you explain all that to your Emperor? There is still time to prevent my telling all that I know about you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Meadowcroft {{is quite}} right," [...] I said, hastily. [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> There {{may be no}} plague, no patient at all. I will go up with this man alone, Hilda, and find out the truth. It will only take me five hours at most. By noon I shall be back with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait! Wait! You know you're exaggerating. You never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{mistress}} stuff till {{just this}} minute! Matter of fact, {{you never have}} 'smirked and hoped for money.' But all the same, you may be right. You ought to run the household as a business. I'll figure out a definite plan tomorrow, and hereafter you'll be on a regular amount or percentage, with your own checking account." ...|$|E
30|$|These are <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> events <b>that</b> are (1) {{related to}} the person {{themselves}} and (2) have actually happened, e.g. “When I rode on a bus in Colorado,” “Painting as a child.” They are anchored in time (and space). In some cases, the “when” can be inferred (e.g. “My high school bio class”).|$|R
60|$|She lay and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> him hours, <b>that</b> night, {{after she}} had gone to bed; and he lay and <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a new way of {{disposing}} a pulley for raising a sail, which he determined to try the effect of early in the morning.|$|R
50|$|Halo {{effect as}} a {{cognitive}} bias {{refers to an}} observer's overall impression of a person, company, brand, or product influences the observer's feelings and <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> entity's character or properties. It was named by psychologist in reference to a person being perceived as having a halo. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to attractiveness and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems. The halo effect is {{a specific type of}} confirmation bias, wherein positive feelings in one area cause ambiguous or neutral traits to be viewed positively. Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded especially in the area of brand marketing.|$|R
