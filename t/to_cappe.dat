50|$|One such machine {{survived and}} {{was put on}} display in 1860 at Burlington House by James Yates, part of a display of Priestley memorabilia. It had been bequeathed by Dr. Robert <b>Cappe</b> <b>to</b> John Bostock. <b>Cappe's</b> machine was bought for {{therapeutic}} purposes at Leeds General Infirmary, where William Hey supported the treatment; Timothy Priestley was paid £5 11s. 6d. for it.|$|R
5000|$|Barwick parish {{church is}} a grade II* listed building. It {{includes}} Anglo-Saxon and Norman stonework, with a 14th-century chancel and various later additions and alterations. [...] The Unitarian minister Newcome Cappe was married here on 19 February 1788 on his second marriage <b>to</b> Catherine <b>Cappe.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wellbeloved's first sermon was preached at Walthamstow on 13 November 1791. Shortly {{afterwards}} {{he received}} through Michael Maurice, father of John Frederick Denison Maurice, {{an invitation to}} become assistant <b>to</b> Newcome <b>Cappe</b> at St Saviourgate Chapel, York. He accepted on 23 Jan. 1792, and began his duties at York on 5 Feb. In 1801 he became sole minister on Cappe's death.The chief feature of his exegetical work was his treatment of prophecy, limiting the range of its prediction, confining that of Hebrew prophecy {{to the age of}} its production, and bounding our Lord's predictions by the destruction of Jerusalem. He broke with the Priestley school, rejecting a general resurrection and fixing the last judgment at death. In these and other points he closely followed the system of Newcome Cappe, but his careful avoidance of dogmatism left his pupils free, and none of them followed him into ‘Cappism.’ Among his coadjutors were Theophilus Browne, William Turner and William Hincks. From 1810 he had the invaluable co-operation of John Kenrick, who married his elder daughter Lætitia.|$|R
5|$|This sincere {{attitude}} {{seems to}} have largely prevailed in practice. Theophilus Lindsey, who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend Newcome <b>Cappe</b> <b>to</b> express his displeasure at a review in {{the first issue of}} the Analytical, demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons, but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.|$|R
2500|$|Meusebach had {{considered}} leaving Texas {{as early as}} November 1845, when he wrote to Count Castell and announced his intention to resign and return to Germany. Meusebach did not feel the Adelsverein was organized enough to achieve its goals. He had survived a hanging mob at his doorstep in New Braunfels on December 31, 1846. The incident had been stirred up by Henry Francis Fisher {{in an attempt to}} usurp Meusebach's power. Meusebach was the target of intrigue instigated by Count Castell, who sent his friend Philip <b>Cappes</b> <b>to</b> Texas ostensibly as Special Commissioner to provide additional funding, but in reality to secretly observe Meusebach to find cause to oust him. In January 1847 in Fredericksburg, Meusebach was again the target of a coup d'état, this time instigated by Dr. Friedrich Schubbert. He again submitted his resignation to accompany a financial report to Castell on January 23, 1847. The effective date of his resignation was July 20, 1847. [...] Hermann Spiess was named his successor.|$|R
40|$|Five women {{members of}} The Canadian Association for Pastoral Practice and Education (CAPPE) who self-identiﬁed as lesbian were interviewed {{concerning}} their experiences of bias based on sexual orientation in supervised pastoral {{education programs and}} its perceived impact {{on the development of}} personal and professional identity. Inductive content analysis indicated that these women experienced less overt bias in the form of homophobia in CAPPE than they did heterosexism. Data obtained suggests the presence of negative effects of heterosexism on collegial relationships, pastoral care/counselor education, theological understanding and the process of professional development. Covert bias in the form of homophobia was experienced in the dynamics of group process, the curriculum content, and the supervisory process within SPE, as it was within organizations afﬁliated with CAPPE such as the institutional church or individual SPE sites. The impact of various forms of bias, such as homophobia and heterosexism on the development of personal and professional identity was identiﬁed in terms of potential risks to ordination status: authentic relationship to self, others and God: and the students’ emotional integrity and safety. Women indicated the need for <b>CAPPE</b> <b>to</b> be pro-active to insure, through Standards and policy-making in SPE program sites, a positive and afﬁrming environment for lesbian and gay pastoral caregivers/counsellors...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crossmodal dynamic visual capture {{occurs when the}} direction of motion of a visual cue causes a weakening or reversal of the perceived direction of motion of a concurrently presented auditory stimulus. It is known {{that there is a}} perceptual bias towards looming compared to receding stimuli, and faster bimodal reaction times have recently been observed for looming cues compared <b>to</b> receding cues (<b>Cappe</b> et al., 2009). The current studies aimed to test whether visual looming cues are associated with greater dynamic capture of auditory motion in depth compared to receding signals. Participants judged the direction of an auditory motion cue presented with a visual looming cue (expanding disk), a visual receding cue (contracting disk), or visual stationary cue (static disk). Visual cues were presented either simultaneously with the auditory cue, or after 500 ms. We found increased levels of interference with looming visual cues compared to receding visual cues, compared to asynchronous presentation or stationary visual cues. The results could not be explained by the weaker subjective strength of the receding auditory stimulus, as in Experiment 2 the looming and receding auditory cues were matched for perceived strength. These results show that dynamic visual capture of auditory motion in the depth plane is modulated by an adaptive bias for looming compared to receding visual cues...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{founding}} members of the Analytical Review were Unitarian and {{quite a few of}} its contributors were Dissenters, so contemporaries believed there to be a bias in the journal (most eighteenth-century journals were overtly partisan). Christie attempted to assuage these fears in his advertisement: It has been insinuated that the Analytical review originated from a party Unitarians, and is meant to serve their purposes. We give ourselves little trouble about such reports. The public will soon judge from the execution of our work, whether we are sincere or not in our professions of impartiality, and to them we appeal. [...] This sincere attitude seems to have largely prevailed in practice.
