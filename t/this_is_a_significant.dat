5|$|Altair rotates rapidly, with a {{velocity}} at {{the equator}} of approximately 286km/s. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{fraction of the}} star's estimated breakup speed of 400km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E

25|$|Insect {{migration}} is the seasonal movement of insects, particularly those by species of dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths. The distance {{can vary from}} species to species, {{but in most cases}} these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference from bird migration.|$|E

25|$|Laredo has {{increased}} the number of non-agricultural jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%-6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5%. As of October 2007, the Laredo unemployment rate was 4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo's unemployment was over 15%.|$|E
25|$|Skeptics {{debated whether}} {{breaking}} down formate {{is enough to}} consider the bacteria living. Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, believes an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Subsequent results from independent research groups have shown {{the validity of the}} 2002 work. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> step that reiterates the need for a new approach to the old problem of studying environmental extremes through experiments. There is practically no debate whether microbial life can survive pressures up to 600 MPa, which has been shown over {{the last decade or so}} to be valid through a number of scattered publications.|$|E
25|$|At {{a steady}} state, when the tissues have been {{saturated}} by the inert gases of the breathing mixture, metabolic processes reduce the partial {{pressure of the}} less soluble oxygen {{and replace it with}} carbon dioxide, which is considerably more soluble in water. In the cells of a typical tissue, the partial pressure of oxygen will drop to around 13mbar (10mmHg), while the partial pressure of carbon dioxide will be about 65mbar (49mmHg). The sum of these partial pressures (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) comes to roughly 900mbar (675mmHg), which is some 113mbar (85mmHg) less than the total pressure of the respiratory gas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> saturation deficit, and it provides a buffer against supersaturation and a driving force for dissolving bubbles.|$|E
50|$|Anzer's {{effectiveness}} as {{a missionary}} in Shandong and the German colonisation {{of parts of}} the province threatened to increase social tensions there.

25|$|Since Dasein (clients in therapy) is a {{relation}} being, constantly engaged in and constituted by ongoing dialogue, ontological hermeneutics states that his symptoms, concerns, and needs are occurring {{in relation to}} others and the world, and not purely in the mind as byproducts of distorted cognitive processes. Hermeneutics holds that even though other forms of therapy, such as Imago therapy, Positive psychotherapy, and Object relations acknowledge the role of relationships in the life and well-being of the client, only ontological hermeneutics fully recognizes and embraces Dasein’s relational mode of existing prior to any other abstract theorizing. Slife states that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference between ontological hermeneutics and all other counseling theories because how a client's suffering is conceptualized will in turn result in how a client's healing is conceptualized.|$|E
25|$|Serious Sam 2s {{gameplay}} consists {{almost entirely}} of the player attempting to defeat dozens of enemies at a time, and thus is relatively simple. The game's story establishes the reasons and methods for how the player travels from chapter to chapter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> change from the previous games in the series in which the story existed merely to transport the player {{from place to place}} in order to kill as many enemies as possible in the process, with the plot consisting merely of messages that the player could disregard without consequence. Serious Sam 2 features the story more prominently, but still maintains the focus on killing as many enemies as possible. The story is developed through the use of cut scenes, which are interspersed throughout the game, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of each Planet.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{applications}} for biodegradable metals, including cardiovascular implants (i.e. stents) and orthopedics. It is in this latter category where these materials offer the greatest potential. Bioresorbable metals are able to withstand loads that would destroy any currently available polymers, and offer much greater plasticity than bioceramics, which are brittle and prone to fracture. A well-designed implant could provide the exact mechanical support needed for different areas (through alloying and metal working), and load would be transferred to the surrounding tissue over time, letting it heal and reducing the effects of stress shielding. A summary of the primary benefits and drawbacks of magnesium biomaterials has been provided by Kirkland. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> problem as the majority of tests performed in the research community are a mix of other standards from both the biomedical and the engineering (e.g. corrosion) communities, often making comparison between results difficult.|$|E
