5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> kill them is a live human voice.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{following}} {{the end of}} the war, one of Lobengula's izinDuna told Dawson that just before Forbes's column had reached the Shangani, two Matabele messengers, Petchan and Sehuloholu, had been given a box of gold sovereigns by Lobengula, and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river. They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute, totalling about £1,000, on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him. [...] "Gold is the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> stop the white men," [...] Lobengula reportedly concluded. According to the inDuna, Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893, the day before it reached the Shangani, and hid in the bush as it went by. They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard.|$|E
500|$|The 45,000-word {{novel was}} {{released}} in November 1995, simultaneous with an abridged audiobook and a two-issue graphic novel. All three versions included a nonfiction essay about child prostitution in Thailand, titled [...] "Child Sex Tourism", by investigative journalist David Hechler. The audiobook featured Tony Roberts, whose performance on the three-hour, two-cassette recording received a positive review from Trudi Miller Rosenblum of Billboard, who wrote that Roberts does [...] "an outstanding job creating a distinctive voice for each character and effectively portraying Batman's complex psyche". The comic book adaption was drafted by Neal Barrett, Jr. with art by Denys Cowan. The novel was published by the Warner Aspect imprint of the Warner Books and promoted by Vachss with a book tour and as a guest at the 1995 San Diego Comic-Con. Vachss used {{the promotion of the}} book to also raise awareness of child abuse and advocate a boycott of manufactured goods from Thailand. He declared that [...] "three years from now, if there isn't a boycott of Thailand, then this book is a cosmic failure". Vachss supported Don't! Buy! Thai!, which believed that [...] "if Thailand sells its children for money, then the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> stop them is the loss of money".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and {{directed}} by Bradley Buecker. Two months before it aired, Murphy confirmed at PaleyFest 2011 {{that there was a}} death planned {{before the end of the}} season, but that it would not be recurring character Dave Karofsky, despite rumors that his death would be paving the way for Kurt's return to McKinley High. Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: [...] "The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. We were actually at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day." [...] The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: [...] "He took me aside at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds like a really great storyline.' It’s the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> break Sue Sylvester’s heart and get to where she lives." [...] Lynch was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work on the show, and submitted [...] "Funeral" [...] to be the episode by which she would be judged.|$|E

[...] After {{proceeding}} through the first stage of the Focus Tower, and arriving in the province of Aquaria, Benjamin locates Phoebe, and learns that Spencer is trapped underground by thick ice floes. [...] Phoebe needs the [...] "wakewater," [...] which is said {{to be able to help}} free Aquaria. [...] Benjamin and Phoebe head to the (aptly named) Wintry Cave and defeat a monster to obtain the Libra Crest. [...] Using this crest to enter the Libra Temple, they find that the source of the [...] "wakewater" [...] has dried up. [...] Finding the Old Man in the back of the Libra Temple, they find that he holds the only bag (water skin, actually) of wakewater, and to use it on the plant in the center of town. [...] Back in Aquaria, they find that the wakewater doesn't work, and reviving the crystal is the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> save the town and Spencer. [...] They head off for the Ice Pyramid and defeat the second of the Vile Evils, the Ice Golem. [...] The Ice Crystal is saved, and Benjamin and Phoebe head back to Aquaria. [...] They find the town is now like Foresta (after the crystal is revived there) and Spencer is back and digging his tunnel to save Captain Mac (Kaeli's Father). [...] Upon leaving, Spencer hands the Venus Key to Benjamin, and tells him to head for Fireburg.|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{increased}} {{her teaching}} commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her {{role of the}} composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of The Planets, on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: [...] "From the moment of Mars... to the last sound of Neptune, {{it was a big}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> last all our lives, I think". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the [...] apocryphal work The Acts of John from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's Hymn of Jesus (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's Mass for Three Voices, and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's Sing Aloud with Gladness. This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of [...] Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: Hymn for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, Barbara Noel's Morris, which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.|$|E
