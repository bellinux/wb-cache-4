30|$|A scheme, named {{preemptive}} routing [31], which {{addresses the}} problem of route failure, tries to detect when route failure is near <b>to</b> <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> potentially avoid the disconnection altogether. The signal strength is used for determining closeness to route failure. When the signal strength goes below a specified threshold (called the preemptive threshold), then it means that link failure is near <b>to</b> <b>occurring.</b> In such a situation, the node concerned must inform the source; as a result, the source initiates discovery of a new route.|$|R

This is most likely <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> if the nest is high in a tree {{and there is a}} good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.|$|E
