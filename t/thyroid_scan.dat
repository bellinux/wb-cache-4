50|$|A <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> using a {{radioactive}} iodine uptake test {{can be used}} in viewing the thyroid. A scan using iodine-123 showing a hot nodule, accompanied by a lower than normal TSH, is strong evidence that the nodule is not cancerous, as most hot nodules are benign.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hyperthyroidism {{is confirmed by}} blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated T4 and T3 levels. TSH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland in the brain that tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make. When {{there is too much}} thyroid hormone, the TSH will be low. A radioactive iodine uptake test and <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> together characterizes or enables radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. The uptake test uses radioactive iodine injected or taken orally on an empty stomach to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland. Persons with hyperthyroidism absorb much more iodine than healthy persons which includes the radioactive iodine which is easy to measure. A <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> producing images is typically conducted in connection with the uptake test to allow visual examination of the over-functioning gland.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a study to {{investigate}} possible underdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the elderly are reported.

40|$|Quantitative <b>thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> using low {{doses of}} 99 mTc sodium pertechnetate (1. 85 - 3. 7 MBq) was {{performed}} in 38 cases of congenital hypothyroidism. Of these 38 cases, 29 were scanned at 14 +/- 6 days old, and 9 at 1 year old. The scans show {{the full range of}} gland anatomy from athyreotic to normal. All morphologically normal scans had grossly increased uptakes of 99 mTc. The incidence of the various thyroid anatomies was different in each age group. The average radiation dose to the thyroid was 2. 29 mGy, with at least 70 % of patients receiving a dose of 3. 0 mGy or less. Such low doses of 99 mTc should allow further scanning in later life. Neonatal <b>thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> reveals the aetiology of congenital hypothyroidism and enables the clinician to assess the short- and long-term needs of the child...|$|R
50|$|If the TSH is high, or the T4 low, the infant's {{doctor and}} parents are called and a {{referral}} to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment. Often a technetium (Tc-99m pertechnetate) <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> is performed to detect a structurally abnormal gland. A radioactive iodine (RAIU) exam will help differentiate congenital absence or a defect in organification (a process necessary to make thyroid hormone).|$|E
50|$|Graves' {{disease is}} the cause of about 50% to 80% of the cases of {{hyperthyroidism}} in the United States. Other causes include multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, inflammation of the thyroid, eating too much iodine, and too much synthetic thyroid hormone. A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests. Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and raised T3 or T4. Radioiodine uptake by the thyroid, <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan,</b> and TSI antibodies may help determine the cause.|$|E

40|$|The paper reports an {{association}} of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and autonomous functioning thyroid nodule in two brothers and in one sister, a healthy carrier of this muscular dystrophy and with analogous thyroid pathology. It is interesting to outline the rarity of this association and the affinity of the clinical and electromyography pictures in thyrotoxic myopathy and in muscular dystrophy. In this three patients were studied: the muscular enzymes, electromyography and biopsy, HLA typing, <b>thyroid</b> <b>scanning,</b> <b>thyroid</b> hormone levels and TGA and TMA antibodies.

30|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> with technetium- 99  m (Tc 99 m) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in detecting orthotopic and ectopic thyroid tissue. Both CT scans and US can help detect ectopic tissue when a lesion demonstrates imaging and enhancement characteristics of thyroid tissue. The absence of normally sited thyroid gland in US and CT scans also supports the diagnosis. In addition, US can guide FNA for cytological confirmation of a thyroid lesion [46]. Ectopic thyroid tissue appears as a well-circumscribed, homogeneous, highly attenuating mass relative to adjacent muscles. Normally, it enhances avidly following the administration of iodinated contrast [1, 45, 47].|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} risk of thyroid cancer in patients with hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules through ultrasonographic-pathologic analysis. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. From 2003 to 2007, 107 patients consecutively presented with hot spots on <b>thyroid</b> <b>scans</b> and low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Among them, 32 patients who had undergone thyroid ultrasonography were analyzed in this study. Thyroid nodules depicted on ultrasonography were classified based on size and categorized as benign, indeterminate, or suspicious malignant nodules according to ultrasonographic findings. The thyroid nodules were determined as either hyperfunctioning or coexisting nodules and were then correlated with pathologic results. Results: In 32 patients, 42 hyperfunctioning nodules (mean number per patient, 1. 31; range, 1 - 6) were observed on <b>thyroid</b> <b>scans</b> and 68 coexisting nodules (mean, 2. 13; range, 0 - 7) were observed on ultrasonography. Twenty-five patients (78. 1 %) {{had at least one}} hyperfunctioning (n = 17, 53. 1 %) or coexisting (n = 16, 50. 0 %) nodule that showed a suspicious malignant feature larger than 5 mm (n = 8, 25. 0 %), or an indeterminate feature 1 cm or greater (n = 20, 62. 5 %) in diameter, which could have been indicated by using fine needle aspiration (FNA). Seven patients were proven to have 11 thyroid cancers in 3 hyperfunctioning and 8 coexisting nodules. All of these had at least one thyroid cancer, which could have been indicated by using FNA.

A CT <b>scan</b> and <b>thyroid</b> <b>scanning</b> revealed a bilobar mass of thyroid tissue, compatible with a lingual thyroid. No thyroid gland was found at its usual location. The woman was euthyroid and since her symptoms were mild she was treated with thyroxin and observation. Lingual thyroid is a rare phenomenon caused by abnormal migration of thyroid cells during the first weeks of fetal life.

In addition, we review the literature regarding coexistence of metastatic thyroid cancer and thyrotoxicosis. Results: A 68 -year-old man with thyrotoxicosis was referred for radioiodine therapy. A routine TcO 4 - <b>thyroid</b> <b>scan</b> revealed high-grade extrathyroidal uptake in the right upper hemithorax {{as well as in the}} left side of the thorax. In view of this finding, radioiodine treatment was deferred; further imaging with computed tomography revealed a 6. 5 -cm mass in a rib on the right side. A biopsy of the rib confirmed the presence of metastatic follicular carcinoma of the thyroid. Scintigraphy revealed sites of metastatic involvement predominantly in the bones along with a cold nodule in the left thyroid lobe, consistent with the primary tumor. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the impact of scintigraphic findings on determining the correct management of a patient who would have otherwise undergone inappropriate treatment.
