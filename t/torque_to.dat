5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|The rider applies <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly <b>Torque</b> <b>to</b> mount {{an assault on}} Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E

25|$|Based on the load, gradient, etc., {{the vehicle}} {{requires}} {{a certain amount}} of <b>torque</b> applied <b>to</b> the drive wheels to move forward. Since an open differential limits total <b>torque</b> applied <b>to</b> both drive wheels to the amount used by the lower traction wheel multiplied by 2, when one wheel is on a slippery surface, the total <b>torque</b> applied <b>to</b> the driving wheels may be lower than the minimum torque required for vehicle propulsion.|$|R

25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% rear wheel drive when driving at a steady speed. When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the front wheels. When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will return <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E
25|$|An open (non-locking or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> each side.

It takes very little <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally to each side, the torque that is applied to the side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|E

25|$|While during normal icebreaking {{operations}} each {{main generator}} fed its dedicated double-armature electric motor, the diesel generator supplying the forward propulsion motor {{could also be}} switched to supply electricity to either of the stern motors. In addition, the current {{from any of the}} main generators could be split between the port and starboard propulsion motors with the control of both motors remaining independent from each other. While the stern propulsion motors were built for double <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> overcome the additional loads from propeller-ice interaction, the electric motor driving the forward-facing propeller was dimensioned for a three-fold <b>torque</b> <b>to</b> keep the propeller turning in difficult ice conditions. The nominal speeds of the propulsion motors were 140 rpm in the stern and 160 rpm in the bow.|$|E
