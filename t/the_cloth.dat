The Chinese ladao process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include tie-dye, batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.|$|E

40|$|Three {{filter cloth}} fabrics {{commonly}} used in drains for coal waste embankments were tested by the Bureau of Mines for clogging behavior and deterioration under simulated field conditions. The objective was to provide guidelines for the mining industry for the proper selection and use of filter cloths to assure safer embankments at mine waste disposal sites. <b>The</b> filter <b>cloths</b> were tested with three coal waste samples in stand-pipes used to simulate coal mine waste disposal environments. Two of <b>the</b> <b>cloths</b> showed a tendency to become clogged with fines from the wastes. One waste caused clogging by precipitating an iron-silicon compound on <b>the</b> test <b>cloths.</b> No apparent cloth deterioration resulted from exposures to the simulated coal waste environments. (The exposures ranged from 2 to 12 months.) In other tests, exposures to waters in the pH range of 2 to 12 and to reagents used in coal-preparation plants resulted in insignificant or no deterioration, as measured by tensile strength. However, long exposures to sunlight (ranging from 4. 6 to 6 months) caused major deterioration in two of <b>the</b> <b>cloths</b> (86 -and 98 -pct losses in tensile strength) and slight deterioration in <b>the</b> third <b>cloth</b> (9 -pct loss in strength) ...|$|R
