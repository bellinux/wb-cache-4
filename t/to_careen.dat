5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> {{and repair}} the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 December 1921 the hulk was towed <b>to</b> <b>Careening</b> Bay, Garden Island, WA. In a {{storm on}} 29 May 1922 she broke her moorings, was blown across Cockburn Sound and ran ashore about [...] north of Rockingham, WA. The Royal Australian Navy served notice for the wreck to be removed, so the SSS offered her for sale where she lay. The {{successful}} bid {{was from a}} syndicate represented by one Owen Carlon.|$|R
60|$|Barrington Isle is, in many respects, {{singularly}} adapted <b>to</b> <b>careening,</b> refitting, refreshing, {{and other}} seamen's purposes. Not only has it good water, and good anchorage, well sheltered from all winds {{by the high}} land of Albemarle, {{but it is the}} least unproductive isle of the group. Tortoises good for food, trees good for fuel, and long grass good for bedding, abound here, and there are pretty natural walks, and several landscapes to be seen. Indeed, though in its locality belonging to the Enchanted group, Barrington Isle is so unlike most of its neighbors, that it would hardly seem of kin to them.|$|R
50|$|If {{the cruise}} were successful, pirates might {{then return to}} the Atlantic by a similar route. Usually there would be a stop again at Madagascar <b>to</b> reprovision, <b>careen,</b> and in some cases await the turning of the monsoon wind.|$|R
25|$|Tew {{urged his}} filibusters {{to hunt down}} and rob the other ships in the Indian convoy, but yielded to the {{opposition}} of the quartermaster.

25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud {{continue}} on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> {{off the side of the}} road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E
25|$|In Thredson's playroom, Thredson rapes Lana, who {{begins to}} see Shachath, but refuses to die just yet. Thredson returns and offers Lana to die by {{strangulation}} or having her throat cut. As {{he tries to}} administer a sedative, she attacks him, renders him unconscious, and escapes into the street. She is {{picked up by a}} man (William Mapother) who begins to go on a misogynistic tirade against women and his wife who cheated on him. He refuses {{to take her to the}} police and begins driving at high speed, becoming manic and pulling out a gun. Lana sees Shachath in the back seat of the car and the man shoots himself in the head, causing the car <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> wildly. Lana wakes up in Briarcliff, having been returned there after the crash was discovered. She frantically tells Sister Mary Eunice that Kit is innocent and that Bloody Face is Thredson, urging her to tell the police. Sister Mary Eunice – who has known this all along – says she believes her, and tells her she is safe in Briarcliff. As she leaves, she tells the guard, Frank, that Lana is just confused from her accident.|$|E

5000|$|Lola (Donna Evans) {{describes}} {{events from}} [...] "The Handicap Spot". George {{parked in a}} handicapped space, which caused her to travel a greater distance {{to get to where}} she was going. Her electric wheelchair was destroyed in an accident when it lost power and Kramer bought her a used wheelchair with faulty brakes which caused her <b>to</b> go <b>careening</b> down a hill.|$|R
50|$|When {{the ship}} had <b>to</b> be <b>careened,</b> pirates needed a safe haven on which to ground the ship. Sloops were well suited for this because {{they were able to}} sail in shallow areas where larger ships would either run aground or be unable to sail through at all. These shallow waters also {{provided}} protection from ships of the British Royal Navy, which tended to be larger and required deep water to sail safely.|$|R
500|$|Whilst at Charles Town, Teach {{learned that}} Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. [...] Teach's {{flotilla}} sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. [...] There they intended <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> their ships to scrape their hulls, but Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers. [...] Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her. [...] A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop.|$|E
2500|$|In April, 1722, Anstis sent Phillips {{and some}} other men ashore on Tobago <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> a {{captured}} frigate. [...] A British warship soon arrived, forcing Anstis to flee and abandon Phillips and his comrades. [...] Phillips avoided capture by hiding in the woods, and later returned to Bristol in England with other abandoned shipmates, where they gave up piracy for a time.|$|E

The same year Time called Buckley's version [...] "exquisitely sung," [...] observing [...] "Cohen murmured the {{original}} like a dirge, but ... Buckley treated the ... song {{like a tiny}} capsule of humanity, using his voice <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> between glory and sadness, beauty and pain... It's {{one of the great}} songs." ...|$|E
50|$|Careening Cove is a bay on the {{northern}} side of Sydney Harbour, near Milsons Point. It is named for the previous use of the bay, <b>careening</b> (<b>to</b> clean a keel and the hull in general, often by rolling the ship on its side).|$|R
50|$|Virginia’s Governor Francis Nicholson {{was furious}} that the Essex Prize had been {{insufficient}} to deter pirates. When that ship needed <b>to</b> be <b>careened</b> and repaired, he warned officials in coastal counties to post lookouts and alert him if they spotted anything suspicious. In April 1700 the warship HMS Shoreham arrived {{to guard the}} coast, too late to catch James but in time to battle and defeat French pirate Louis Guittar, who’d sailed into the area hoping to replicate James’ success.|$|R
50|$|During the {{remainder}} of this foray against British shipping, Wickes took five additional prizes and left them at Port Louis. Wickes moved Reprisal to Lorient, but was ordered to leave the port in 24 hours by the French government—the port authorities apparently stirred to action by bitter remonstrances from the British government. Wickes, however, claimed that Reprisal had sprung a leak and needed <b>to</b> be <b>careened</b> for hull repairs. Wickes proved to be skillful at gaining time; as, on several occasions, he thwarted the intentions of the French government to have him sail.|$|R
2500|$|... "Sometimes, it even {{happened}} that although I was asleep and {{aware of the}} fact, I was unable to get up. It took some effort on my part to move the body and by that come back to waking consciousness again. My own understanding {{at that time was}} that the stilled, one-pointed heart, didn't allow thoughts <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> away externally and so would definitely be able to transcend every bit of suffering. I thought that wisdom's only function was to purge the out-wanderings of the heart and return it to a state of stillness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{ten months}} between the Battle of Chaul and Diu, {{important}} developments {{took place on}} the Muslim field: Hussain took the chance <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> his ships and recovered a straggled carrack with a reinforcement of 300 men. Notwithstanding, the relationship between Hussain and Ayyaz worsened, with Hussain now plainly aware of the duplicity of Ayyaz, who had taken custody of the Portuguese prisoners at Chaul - which Hussain apparently intended [...] "to send back to Cairo stuffed". Unable to pay the remaining of his troops, Hussain was forced to pawn his own artillery pieces to Ayyaz himself. Presumably, only either the hope of fresh reinforcements or fear of the reaction of the Sultan now prevented him from returning to Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|Port Royal {{provided}} a [...] initially for privateers and subsequently for pirates plying the shipping lanes {{to and from}} Spain and Panama. Buccaneers found Port Royal appealing for several reasons. Its proximity to trade routes allowed them easy access to prey, {{but the most important}} advantage was the port's proximity to several of the only safe passages or straits giving access to the Spanish Main from the Atlantic. The harbour was large enough to accommodate their ships and {{provided a}} place <b>to</b> <b>careen</b> and repair these vessels. It was also ideally situated for launching raids on Spanish settlements. From Port Royal, Christopher Myngs sacked Campeche and Henry Morgan attacked Panama, Portobello, and Maracaibo. Additionally, buccaneers Roche Brasiliano, John Davis and Edward Mansvelt used Port Royal as a base of operations.|$|E
50|$|It {{starts with}} Lorraine {{discovering}} that Barbara's sugar bowl {{is full of}} salt. Lorraine notices a lot of odd little things about Barbara's behavior. The main thing is that her daughter is uncharacteristically quick to anger. Lorraine asks George if he hasn't noticed the changes in Barbara, but he brushes it off. But George has indeed noticed the changes in Barbara and is most troubled by her temper, which has always had an edge, but seems now <b>to</b> be <b>careening</b> out of control. One evening she gets so angry during a squabble that she bites her husband.|$|R

50|$|A {{small but}} {{important}} Royal Navy Dockyard {{was established by}} the British {{on the north side}} of the harbour, opposite the town, in 1715.

Several Dockyard buildings, dating from the 1760s, can still be seen on Illa Pinto (formerly known as Saffron Island) including a Naval Storehouse with clock tower. There recently have been moves to establish a maritime museum here.

Act I opens with Connor at the wheel of a van, driving wildly, Howard accompanying. The setup is established. Act IlI returns <b>to</b> the <b>careening</b> van and then flashbacks to the college meeting of Connor and Howard.
