25|$|Indications for bracing: {{people who}} are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table. For example, a person who is still growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|E

60|$|So much then a {{reasonable}} appreciation will find in Mr. Shaw <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bracing</b> and excellent. He claims {{to see things}} as they are; and some things, at any rate, he does see as they are, which the whole of our civilization does not see at all. But in Mr. Shaw's realism there is something lacking, and that thing which is lacking is serious.|$|R
60|$|She said nothing. She seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bracing</b> {{herself for}} that last effort. Now {{they could see}} the bare rocky outline of the summit of the hill. A few steps more, and they would pass through the gate. And then the sound came, the sound which somehow they had dreaded. Sharp and crisp through the {{twilight}} air came the report of a revolver. They even fancied that they heard a little moan come travelling down the hillside.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a little}} shiver amongst the audience. Francis, almost <b>to</b> his horror, <b>was</b> unable <b>to</b> resist the feeling of queer {{excitement}} which stole through his veins. A few yards away, Lady Isabel seemed to have become transformed. She was leaning forward in her chair, her eyes glowing, her lips parted, rejuvenated, dehumanised. Francis' immediate companion, however, rather surprised him. Her eyes were fixed intently upon Sir Timothy's. She seemed <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> weighing every word he had spoken. There was none of that hungry pleasure in her face which shone from the other woman's and {{was reflected in the}} faces of many of the others. She seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bracing</b> herself for a shock. Sir Timothy looked over his shoulder towards the door which opened upon the sanded space.|$|R
60|$|Released forward, {{the stern}} of the Coquette yielded to the {{pressure}} of her enemy, whose sails were all drawing, and she was soon in a position to enable her head-yards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> sharp aback, in a direction opposite to the one in which she had so lately lain. The whole broadside was then delivered into {{the stern of}} la Fontange, the last grapnel was released and the ships separated.|$|E

25|$|Davuls were {{ideal for}} use as {{military}} instruments because of the unique {{way in which they}} could be carried. The Ottoman janissaries, for example, hung their davuls at their breasts with thick straps. This made it easier for the soldiers to carry their instruments from battle to battle. This practice does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limited <b>to</b> just the Ottoman Empire, however; in Egypt, drums very similar <b>to</b> davuls <b>were</b> <b>braced</b> with cords, which allowed the Egyptian soldiers to carry them during military movements.|$|R
60|$|There {{was plenty}} {{of work to do}} as they went down the river. The sails had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> round as the wind took them on {{different}} sides in the winding reaches; the decks were sluiced down, {{to get rid of the}} first coat of dirt which they had acquired in the docks; ropes had to be coiled and tidied up, and the many articles lying loosely about the deck to be put in their places and lashed in readiness for sea work. The tide met them just as it was getting dark, and as the wind dropped, and was not sufficiently strong to carry the ship against it, the anchor was dropped a few miles below Gravesend.|$|E
60|$|With the day, {{though not}} so {{early as the}} sun, uprose Miss Susan Nipper. There was a {{heaviness}} in this young maiden's exceedingly sharp black eyes, that abated somewhat of their sparkling, and suggested--which was not their usual character--the possibility of their being sometimes shut. There was likewise a swollen look about them, {{as if they had}} been crying over-night. But the Nipper, so far from being cast down, was singularly brisk and bold, and all her energies appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> up for some great feat. This was noticeable even in her dress, which was much more tight and trim than usual; and in occasional twitches of her head as she went about the house, which were mightily expressive of determination.|$|E

In the cities, man lives in comfort by using machines, but he's up against Nature {{all the time in}} the wilds. She must be fought and beaten and he must leave behind the weapons he knows. Up North, a small accident or carelessness may cost you your life; an ax forgotten, a bag of flour lost, mean frostbite and hunger that may stop the march. You have got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> and watchful; it's a grim country and it kills off the slack. But we are only on its edge and things are different here. If we are beaten, we can fall back. The trail to the cities is open." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{theory of}} Posterior Guided Occlusion (PGO) has a static and dynamic {{component}}. The static component is {{a position where}} the mandible <b>is</b> in a <b>braced,</b> neuromuscular position at which the posterior teeth touch stable, non-deflecting surfaces on opposing teeth. It allows the antero-medial aspect {{of the head of}} the mandibular condyle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> firmly <b>braced</b> on the medial aspect of the glenoid fossa. This anatomical position allows for the maximal coordinated contraction of the major muscles of closure of the mandible.|$|R
50|$|The fin had a cropped {{triangular}} {{profile and}} the tailplane was mounted well forward on it, {{just above the}} fuselage <b>to</b> which it <b>was</b> <b>braced</b> from below on each side with a single strut.

6000|$|But {{at such a}} time as this {{there is}} always one person who seems {{interested}} in what I say--a German gentleman, a professor, who sits next to me at dinner, and whom I must tell you more about another time. He is very learned, and has a great desire for information; he appreciates a great many of my remarks, and after dinner, in the salon, he often comes to me to ask me questions about them. I have to think a little, sometimes, to know what I did say, or what I do think. He takes you right up where you left off; and he is almost as fond of discussing things as William Platt is. He is splendidly educated, in the German style, and he told me the other day that he was an [...] "intellectual broom." [...] Well, if he is, he sweeps clean; I told him that. After he has been talking to me I feel as if I hadn't got a speck of dust left in my mind anywhere. It's a most delightful feeling. He says he's an observer; and I am sure there is plenty over here to observe. But I have told you enough for to-day. I don't know how much longer I shall stay here; I am getting on so fast that it sometimes seems as if I shouldn't need all the time I have laid out. I suppose your cold weather has promptly begun, as usual; it sometimes makes me envy you. The fall weather here is very dull and damp, and I feel very much as if I should like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> up.|$|E
6000|$|People to whom cold means misery, {{who hate}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced,</b> and shudder {{at the word}} [...] "seasonable," [...] can have little {{difficulty}} in accounting for {{the origin of the}} sports of winter. They need only adapt to the circumstances that old Lydian tradition which says that games of chance were invented during a great famine. Men permitted themselves to eat only every second day, and tried to forget their hunger in playing at draughts and dice. That is clearly the invention of a southern people, which never had occasion to wish it could become oblivious of the weather, as too many of us would like to be in England. Such shivering and indolent folks may be inclined to say that skating and curling and wildfowl-shooting, and the other diversions which seduce the able-bodied from the warm precincts of the cheerful fire, were only contrived to enable us to forget the state of the thermometer. Whether or not that was the purpose of the first northerner who fixed sheep-bones beneath his feet, to course more smoothly over the frozen sound, {{there can be no doubt}} that winter sports answer their presumed purpose. They keep up that glow which only exercise in the open air can give, and promote the health which shows itself in the complexion. It is the young lady who interprets literally the Scotch invitation [...] "come into the fire," [...] and who spoils the backs of library novels by holding them too near the comfortable hearth, she it is who suffers from the ignoble and unbecoming liberties that winter takes with the human countenance. Happier and wiser is she who studies the always living and popular Dutch roll rather than the Grecian bend, and who blooms with continual health and good temper. Our changeful climate affords so few opportunities of learning to skate, that it is really extraordinary to find so much skill, and to see feats so difficult and graceful. In Canada, where frost is a certainty, and where the covered [...] "rinks" [...] make skating an indoor sport, it is not odd that great perfection should be attained. But as fast as Canadians bring over a new figure or a new trick it is picked up, and critics may dispute as to whether the bold and dashing style of the English school of skaters is not preferable to the careful and smooth, but somewhat pretty and niggling manner of the colonists. Our skating stands to the Canadian fashion somewhat as French does to English etching. We have the dash and the chic with skates which Frenchmen show with the etching-needle, and the Canadian, on the other hand, is apt to decline into the mere prettiness which is the fault of English etchers.|$|E

50|$|Rutog is a {{small town}} on the Ladakh {{frontier}} of Tibet, close <b>to</b> India. Rudok <b>is</b> picturesquely situated {{on the side of a}} hill standing isolated in the plain near the east end of Lake Pangong in Ladakh. Historically an integral part of Ladakh, it is also geographically and culturally a part of Ladakh. The houses are built in tiers, whitewashed and walled in. At the top of the hill are a large palace and several monasteries painted red. About a mile away from the foot of the hill is another monastery. Rudok is about 13,300 feet above sea-level, and the greatest altitude on the route connecting it with Lhasa at the pass of Mariom la (the water-parting between the Brahmaputra and the Sutlej) is 15,500 feet. The winter climate of Rutog and of all the towns of the Tsangpo basin, owing to the intense dryness of the air and the light fall of snow, seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bracing</b> and exhilarating rather than severe. The thermometer never approaches the minimum record of Puetra (in the same latitude and at half the absolute elevation), according to the observations of native surveyors.|$|R

50|$|The first {{firearms}} {{were made}} {{at a time when}} metallurgy was not advanced enough to cast tubes able to withstand the explosive forces of early cannon, so the pipe (often built from staves of metal) needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> periodically along its length, producing an appearance somewhat reminiscent of a storage barrel.|$|E
50|$|Teeth <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> {{will have}} an {{adhesive}} applied to help the cement bond {{to the surface of}} the tooth. In most cases the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the molars to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible.|$|E
5000|$|The yard can rotate {{around the}} mast {{to allow the}} {{direction}} of the vessel to be changed relative to the wind. When running directly downwind the yards are 'squared', pointing perpendicular to the ship's centre line. As the ship is steered closer to the wind the yards are braced round using the braces. When further rotation is obstructed by other bits of rigging (typically the shrouds), the yard is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>braced</b> [...] "hard round" [...] or [...] "sharp up", as in [...] "sharp up to port". This angle (normally about 60 degrees) limits how close to the wind a square rigged ship can sail.|$|E
