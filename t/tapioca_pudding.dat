25|$|Nicaragua is {{primarily}} an agricultural country; agriculture constitutes 60% {{of its total}} exports which annually yield approximately US $300 million. Nearly two-thirds of the coffee crop comes from {{the northern part of}} the central highlands, in the area north and east of the town of Estelí. Soil erosion and pollution from the heavy use of pesticides have become serious concerns in the cotton district. Yields and exports have both been declining since 1985. Today most of Nicaragua's bananas are grown in the northwestern part of the country near the port of Corinto; sugarcane is also grown in the same district. Cassava, a root crop somewhat similar to the potato, is an important food in tropical regions. Cassava is also the main ingredient in <b>tapioca</b> <b>pudding.</b> Nicaragua's agricultural sector has benefited because of the country's strong ties to Venezuela. It is estimated that Venezuela will import approximately $200 million in agricultural goods. In the 1990s, the government initiated efforts to diversify agriculture. Some of the new export-oriented crops were peanuts, sesame, melons, and onions.|$|E

5000|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, saying [...] "There are times when 22 Jump Street is {{borderline}} brilliant. Unfortunately, those instances are outnumbered by segments that don't work for one reason or another." [...] Jaime N. Christley of Slant Magazine gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "As funny and batshit insane as the movie often is, the fact that 22 Jump Street knows it's a tiresome sequel doesn't save it from being a tiresome sequel, even as Lord and Miller struggle to conceal the bitter pill of convention in the sweet <b>tapioca</b> <b>pudding</b> of wall-to-wall jokes." [...] Scott Tobias of The Dissolve gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "22 Jump Street squeezes every last drop of comic inspiration it can get from Tatum and Hill, as well as the very notion of a sequel to such a superfluous enterprise." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B, saying [...] "22 Jump Street is a mixed bag of clever spoofery and miscalculated outrageousness. The unveiled homoeroticism of practically all interaction between Jenko and Schmidt is amusing to the point when it isn't." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "This is a sequel that wears its well-worn formula, mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly, flying the high-lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not-too-dumb." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "22 Jump Street hits far more often than it misses, and even when it misses by a mile, the effort is so delightfully zany that it's hard not to give Lord and Miller an 'A' for effort." ...|$|E
