40|$|Plasma-assisted {{nitriding}} is {{an attractive}} surface treatment for metallurgical surface modification to improve wear, hardness and fatigue resistance of ferrous and non-ferrous materials. For this purpose, ion nitriding by a d. c. glow discharge is generally efficient for numerous materials. However, for some metals and alloys, the processing temperature, dominated by the discharge parameters, is too high and cannot be controlled independently from the plasma reactivity. This paper reviews the following solutions for low-temperature plasma-assisted nitriding: pulsed d. c. discharge, thermionically assisted d. c. triode arrangements, plasma implantation, electron cyclotron resonance systems and <b>thermionic</b> <b>arc</b> discharges. We focus on metallurgical results obtained by these techniques on austenitic stainless steel and aluminium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} via {{computer}} simulations that a protru-sion on a <b>thermionic</b> <b>arc</b> cathode may dramatically change {{the pattern of}} steady-state modes of current transfer. This happens through a bifurcation of a special type occurring at certain geom-etry of the cathode and {{may play a role}} in operation of electrodes of compact high-intensity discharge lamps. Index Terms—Arc attachment, arc cathode, bifurcation of current transfer, bifurcation theory, high-pressure arc. CONSIDERABLE advances in theoretical and experimen-tal investigation of the plasma–cathode interaction in high-pressure arc discharges have been achieved during the last decade [1]. Simulation methods, available at present and validated experimentally, allow one to reliably describe many aspects of operation of thermionic cathodes. A challenging task is to simulate operation of cathodes of complex geometries, which are of practical interest, in particu-lar, those with protrusions [2], [3]. Results of such simulations are reported in this paper. Steady-state modes of current transfer have been calculated with the use of the commercial software COMSOL Multi-physics, as described in [4]. Stability of each of the steady-state modes has been investigated, as described in [5]. In Fig. 1, current–voltage characteristics U(I) are shown of axially symmetric steady-state modes of current transfer to an axially symmetric tungsten cathode in the form of a rod of radius R = 750 µm and a height of 12 mm (here, U is the near-cathode voltage drop, and I is the arc current). The cathode has a hemispherical tip. A spherical protrusion with a radius of 200 µm is located at the top of the tip. The arc operates in argon under the pressure of 2 bar. Also shown is the dependence of the maximum temperature of the cathode surface on the arc current. Stable and unstable sections of each mode are shown by solid or dotted lines, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Thermionic</b> Vacuum <b>Arc</b> (TVA) {{discharge}} is {{an original}} technology for thin film deposition in high vacuum conditions. The originality {{of this method}} consists {{in the fact that}} the substrate is bombarded with energetic ions (of 200 - 500 eV) of the material to be deposited just during deposition and no buffer gas is needed. The TVA plasma is ignited in the vapors of the anode material by heated cathode electron bombardment.

40|$|Arc and glow {{discharges}} {{are defined}} {{based on their}} cathode processes. Arcs are characterized by collective electron emission, which can be stationary with hot cathodes (<b>thermionic</b> <b>arcs),</b> or non-stationary with cold cathodes (cathodic arcs). A brief review on cathodic arc properties serves {{as the starting point}} to better understand arcing phenomena in sputtering. Although arcing occurs in both metal and reactive sputtering, it is more of an issue in the reactive case. Arcing occurs if sufficiently high field strength leads to thermal runaway of an electron emission site. The role of insulating layers and surface potential adjustment through current leakage is highlighted. In the situation of magnetron sputtering with ''racetrack'', the need for a model with two spatial dimensions is shown. In many cases, arcing is initiated by breakdown of dielectric layers and inclusions. It is most efficiently prevented if formation and excessive charge-up of dielectric layers and inclusions can be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Interactions are {{considered}} between a moving, alkali-metal seeded, dense plasma and a metallic electrode whose surface properties {{are influenced by}} the absorption of seed particles. The plasma behavior is governed by a set of differential equations, which are coupled to the surface through the boundary conditions.

The solution of the problem yields the state of the surface as well as the spatial distribution of plasma properties. In particular, electrode voltage drops are predicted, which indicate whether the electrode operates in a <b>thermionic</b> or <b>arc</b> mode. The method has been applied to a potassiwn-seeded argon plasma in contact with a tungsten electrode in a stagnation flow geometry. The results show that the plasma - surface interaction may lead to large electrode currents at moderate voltage drops. These currents can be up to an order of magnitude greater than what the random electron current would be at the surface under conditions of perfect thermodynamic equilibrium at the surface temperature.

40|$|Material {{migration}} in ITER {{is expected to}} move beryllium (Be) eroded from the first wall primarily to the tungsten (W) divertor region and to magnetically shadowed areas of the wall itself. This paper is concerned with experimental study of Be layer response to ELM-like plasma pulses using the new QSPA-Be plasma gun (SRC RF TRINITI). The Be layers (1 → 50 µm thick) are deposited on special castellated Be and W targets supplied by the ITER Organization using the <b>Thermionic</b> Vacuum <b>Arc</b> technique. Transient deuterium plasma pulses with duration ∼ 0. 5 ms were selected to provide absorbed energy densities on the plasma stream axis for a 30 ° target inclination of 0. 2 and 0. 5 MJm− 2, the first well below and the second near the Be melting point. This latter value {{is close to the}} prescribed maximum energy density for controlled ELMs on ITER. At 0. 2 MJm− 2 on W, all Be layer thicknesses tested retain their integrity up to the maximum pulse number, except at local defects (flakes, holes and cracks) and on tile edges. At 0. 5 MJm− 2 on W, Be layer melting and melt layer agglomeration are the main damage processes, they happen immediately in the first plasma impact. Melt layer movement was observed only near plasma facing edges. No significant melt splashing is observed in spite of high plasma pressure (higher than expected in ITER). Be layer of 10 µm thick on Be target has higher resistance to plasma irradiation than 1 and 55 µm, and retain their integrity up to the maximum pulse number at 0. 2 MJm− 2.

The Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) and combination between GMR and Tunneling Magnetoresistive (TMR) properties of the thin film structures were {{the aim of the}} work. The proposed method in order to obtain the desired granular structures is based on electron beam emitted by an externally heated cathode, accelerated by a high anodic potential. The work consisted in preparing two sets of samples, first being a combination between Fe–Co as magnetic materials embedded in a Cu matrix, with a total thickness of 200 nm. The second structure was a combination between Fe–Co (50 %– 50 %) alloy, embedded in a matrix of Cu combined with MgO with a thickness of 200 nm. Both sets of samples were obtained by three simultaneous types of discharges. Because of the substrate positioning in respect with the three anode–cathode systems, different material concentrations were obtained, confirmed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) measurement results. Structural and morphological properties were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy; Atomic Force Microscopy and EDS. Electrical properties of the obtained samples were studied using the 4 point measurement method. The magnetic properties were first studied using a non-destructive optical method called MOKE (Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect). Electrical resistance behavior of the granular type structures was studied for different values of the magnetic field, up to 0. 3 T, at different values of the sample temperature.
