5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan as a {{girl next}} door archetype and intended for <b>the</b> <b>character</b> to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing <b>the</b> <b>character,</b> Cherry drew upon his personal experiences {{as well as those}} of single women in his life. The role was originally written for Mary-Louise Parker, who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>character</b> is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' debut season, both <b>the</b> <b>character</b> and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> was received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the series.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns <b>the</b> <b>character</b> {{experience}} points, {{and after}} earning enough points, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
