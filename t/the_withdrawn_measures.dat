40|$|Selective {{withdrawal}} from a thermal stratified reservoir {{has been widely}} utilized in managing reservoir water withdrawal. Besides theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, model test was also necessary in studying <b>the</b> temperature of <b>withdrawn</b> water. However, information on the similarity theory of <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> water temperature model remains lacking. Considering flow features of selective withdrawal, the similarity theory of <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> water temperature model was analyzed theoretically based on the modification of governing equations, the Boussinesq approximation, and some simplifications. The similarity conditions between the model and the prototype were suggested. <b>The</b> conversion of <b>withdrawn</b> water temperature between the model and the prototype was proposed. Meanwhile, the fundamental theory of temperature distribution conversion was firstly proposed, which could significantly improve the experiment efficiency when the basic temperature of the model {{was different from the}} prototype. Based on the similarity theory, an experiment was performed on <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> water temperature which was verified by numerical method...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} Initial Public Offering (IPO) showed that IPO stocks average were under priced, underperformed in the long-run after market.

This paper explains IPO anomaly by using theoretical model (<b>the</b> <b>Withdrawn</b> IPO), In <b>the</b> WIPO Model, the observed positive average initial return is caused by <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> of IPO's with negative potential initial return.

50|$|The motherhouse at Emmitsburg {{negotiated}} for {{affiliation with}} the Daughters of Charity in France. In consequence there developed a tendency to dispense with certain customs observed at Emmitsburg because these changes were required by the French superiors; for example, the sisters in charge of boys' asylums were everywhere to be <b>withdrawn.</b> <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> threatened at that period {{the very existence of}} the New York orphanage. The allegiance of the sisters to local Catholics in New York came in conflict with their obedience to their superiors in Emmitsburg, eventually leading to the establishment of a separate order recognized as the Sisters of Charity of New York (SCNY).In 1846, the Sisters in New York incorporated as a separate entity from the Sisters of Charity still based in Maryland. Archbishop John Hughes' sister, Mary Angela Hughes, was by then superior of the Sisters in New York. They became the Sisters of Charity of New York. This was not unusual, in that several other groups of Sisters founded by Seton established themselves as independent diocesan entities once their communities reached maturity. The novitiate of the New York community was opened at St. James's Academy, 35 East Broadway, and later moved to the new motherhouse on an estate purchased at Mcgown's Pass, situated within the limits of the present Central Park. Here, in 1847, the Academy of Mount Saint Vincent had its foundation. In the late 1850s the sisters bought the Edwin Forrest estate called Font Hill and the Motherhouse and academy relocated to the Riverdale section of the Bronx.|$|R

40|$|Child-centred {{teaching}} and learning approach is a progressive approach that demands for active participation of all children in the classroom process. Educationists and Professional Educational Institutions like IED are advocating for this approach. As a result, more and more teachers are being exposed to this progressive approach of {{teaching and}} learning. As teachers embrace this approach, one may wonder whether {{they are able to}} enhance the participation of all children, including <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> ones in <b>the</b> classroom process. Therefore, apart from creating awareness about withdrawn children who may be forgotten, ignored and isolated in the classroom, this exploratory case study was also carried out to find out the opportunities that exist in the classroom that could enable and/or enhance the participation of <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> children. This study describes the experiences of withdrawn/unresponsive children in and outside the classroom through detailed classroom observations, interviewing some of the teachers, <b>the</b> two case <b>withdrawn</b> children and parents to one of the case children, and through analysis of relevant documents. The study found out that, though the teacher I observed had been exposed to child-centered {{teaching and learning}} strategies, like group work, pair work, the use of role plays, drama, discussions etc., through professional development courses and through the H. A. S programme being propagated in the school by the H. A. S. -IED team, that could have been used to enhance classroom participation of all children including <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> ones, she was unable to maximize the use of these strategies in the classroom. However, the findings suggest that the warm friendly relationship the teacher had with all children including <b>the</b> <b>withdrawn</b> ones in <b>the</b> classroom, which was shown in the way she related to them, indicated that the teacher valued, loved and respected all the children. This relationship may have enhanced the children 2 ̆ 7 s self-esteem, thus, leading to occasional interaction between the teacher and the children, hence, enabling <b>the</b> two <b>withdrawn</b> case children to participate...|$|R
