A computer vision system, consisting of field-acquired video and subsequent analysis, could improve {{the efficiency of the}} current methods. Such a system is prototyped, and the following challenges are addressed: the detection, segmentation, and defect assessment of <b>track</b> <b>components</b> whose appearance vary across different tracks and the identification and inspection of special track areas such as track turnouts. An algorithm that utilizes the periodic manner in which <b>track</b> <b>components</b> repeat in an inspection video is developed.

Another popular race is the online HFAY racing series. Each local club or individual builds his or her race track using standard RCP <b>track</b> <b>component</b> and post their time on the internet.

50|$|Upon {{improvements}} to the road network in the region, the railway's use declined steeply. In 1996, Deutsche Bahn (DB) transferred freight operations to Waldhof. In 1998, Waldhof was also given track maintenance responsibilities. That same year, the route was deactivated between Morbach and Hermeskeil. In 2003, inspections found that the stretch between Stromberg and Morbach {{was found to have}} safety deficiencies. DB petitioned to have the rails removed for that <b>track</b> <b>component,</b> but the Federal Railway Authority declined the application and ordered the stretch to be reactivated for use. An appeal of the decision by DB to the federal court in Koblenz was turned down, with the court stating that the company's obligation to serve the Hunsrück outweighed economic matters. A higher federal appeals court however overturned that decision, citing it unreasonable that future infrastructure investment along the railway was realistic. The state of Rheinland-Pfalz then sued DB, causing the railway to be released from DB's jurisdiction.|$|E

30|$|Track structure, a {{load bearing}} and {{transmitting}} structure of railway system, has stiffness to provide necessary elasticity. Track structure comprises several layers and each layer has its own stiffness, namely the <b>track</b> <b>component</b> stiffness. The overall track stiffness is usually adopted to characterize the total stiffness of all layers and reflect the stiffness characteristics of the whole track structure [1, 2]. The stiffness measurement of a track, generally, refers to measuring the overall stiffness. In laboratory tests, the stiffness of certain <b>track</b> <b>component</b> can be measured, such as fastener stiffness and ballast stiffness [3, 4].|$|E

40|$|Assessment of {{condition}} of railway track {{is crucial for}} track design, repair and effective maintenance operations. In-field dynamic testing in combination with track modelling represents an efficient strategy for identification of the current {{condition of}} railway track structure and its components. This paper presents an integrated approach combining field measurements, experimental modal analysis and finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic parameters of the in-situ railway <b>track</b> <b>components.</b> Based on the discrete support model, a two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) dynamic model of railway track is analysed in order to extract the modal properties of the <b>track</b> <b>components</b> from the field dynamic testing results obtained using an instrumented hammer impact technique. A railway track site in Central Queensland managed by Queensland Rail (QR) was selected to perform the field tests. Five sleeper-fastening-rail assemblies were selected for dynamic testing. The frequency response functions (FRFs) were recorded by using Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE vibration analyser in a frequency domain between 0 and 1, 600 Hz. The data obtained have been best fitted using the least-square technique to determine the dynamic stiffness and damping constants of the tested <b>track</b> <b>components.</b> These results can supply a track maintenance engineer with very important information on {{the current state of}} the railway track. In addition, the experimentally determined resonance frequencies along with the dynamic properties of the <b>track</b> <b>components</b> can provide an important input for determining the maximum speed and axle load for the future track upgrades...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOn a {{deteriorated}} track, {{speed restriction}} decelerates the deterioration evolution, allowing the track {{to have a}} greater chance to survive for a longer repair delay time. However, if a slower speed increases the lifetime of the <b>track</b> <b>component</b> and thus authorizes a delayed maintenance, it also reduces the throughput of the system and hence the benefit. On the other hand, a longer preventive maintenance delay time gives more time to better organize and plan the maintenance at a reduced cost, and more opportunities to optimally group the maintenance activities on different track components to save maintenance setup costs. We have thus a maintenance optimization problem to solve, and, in this context, the objective of this work is to develop a maintenance cost model to determine the optimal tuning of the two considered decision variables: maintenance delay time and speed restriction. To this aim, we want to assess the effect of speed restriction on the delayed maintenance cost and system profit for a railway section, in which the deterioration of the <b>track</b> <b>component</b> depends on the train speed and the number of passing trains. The problem is to determine an optimal speed restriction and a preventive repair delay to maximize the system benefit (i. e. system profit minus maintenance costs) and minimize the system downtime. Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) are used to model maintenance and operation of the railway section. The CPN model describes the gradual track deterioration from the good to the failed state using a stochastic process. Two levels of maintenance are implemented according to the observed <b>track</b> <b>component</b> states, which are identified by periodic inspection. Different speed restriction policies and maintenance delaying strategies are considered and implemented. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the railway section under these different policies, which is measured by maintenance cost, the system benefit and the system downtime. Numerical experiments results illustrate how the maintenance decision variables can be optimally tuned...|$|E

40|$|An {{existing}} analytical model, in use by Spoornet for {{the past}} two decades for calculating rail stresses on railway track, was revisited and improved. The model provided engineers with an easy-to-use program for evaluating track capacity and authorizing heavier loads on track. The model was modified to calculate rail and <b>track</b> <b>component</b> stresses more accurately. These modifications include the incorporation of current best practices and presentation of guidelines for the engineer on how to determine some input parameters which are normally difficult to obtain. Firstly it was determined which input parameters the model was the most sensitive to. Thereafter it was determined whether or not the correct information would generally be readily available for those sensitive parameters. The most sensitive parameters were further investigated and test results, as well as best practice analytical methods, were used to establish nominal input values and guidelines for determining such values. This research was necessary to establish whether or not the currently used analytical model still provided railway engineers with a useful tool and whether or not more modern and popular tools could validate or replace it. After some modifications to the analytical model, it was proved that it provides engineers with a suitably accurate tool for calculating rail and <b>track</b> <b>component</b> stresses, without the need to build time-consuming models of the track under investigation. It showed that the model, after some modifications, is current with calculational methods in recent publications and provides an immediate answer to "what-if" questions without the need to run lengthy analyses.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{means to}} reduce the component of railway rolling noise radiated by the track {{is to increase the}} damping of the rail. This increases the attenuation with distance of vibrations transmitted along the rail and thereby reduces the noise radiated. To achieve this, a tuned, damped mass-spring absorber system has been designed. To cover a wide range of frequencies, multiple tuning frequencies are used along with a material with a high damping loss factor. Suitable materials have been found from extensive tests on samples and prototypes of the damper have been built and tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. Results are very promising with reductions of the <b>track</b> <b>component</b> of noise of around 6 dB being measured...|$|E
