5|$|Excavations for {{construction}} of the building's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961.

5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} by the fact that <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E

5|$|Bids for {{construction}} were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company {{to construct the}} hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour {{authorities}} had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, in April 1894 the {{completed}} hull passed static pressure tests. It was launched , 1894 during a fleet review attended by Tsar Nicholas II. The commissioning of Sissoi Veliky {{was scheduled for}} September 1896, but an examination in August revealed that the steering gear, water pumps, ventilation system {{and one of the}} turrets were still missing or defective. <b>The</b> <b>builders</b> hastily equipped the ship with rudder controls built for Poltava and delivered the ship for her sea trials on , 1896. The Navy desperately needed Sissoi Veliky in the Mediterranean and she was commissioned regardless of her known faults.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania {{was laid}} down on 27 October 1913, with goals of {{fourteen}} months until launch, and thirty-two until completion.

5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings {{to fit in with}} the previous architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began {{to build their own}} castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>builders</b> of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E
