5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata {{is not as good}} as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{volunteers in}} Bosnia {{have been accused}} of {{committing}} war crimes during the conflict. However, the ICTY has never issued indictments against mujahideen fighters. Instead, the ICTY indicted some Bosnian Army commanders on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. The ICTY acquitted Amir Kubura and Enver Hadžihasanović of the Bosnian 3rd Corps of all charges related to the incidents involving mujahideen. Furthermore, the Appeals Chamber noted that the relationship between the 3rd Corps and the El Mujahedin detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a distinct enemy force.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez's grandmother, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes, {{played an}} {{influential}} {{role in his}} upbringing. He {{was inspired by the}} way she [...] "treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural." [...] The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was [...] "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality". He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the irrefutable truth. It was a deadpan style that, some thirty years later, heavily influenced her grandson's most popular novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude.|$|E

500|$|During {{its entire}} operation, Treblinka I's commandant was Sturmbannführer Theodor van Eupen. He ran the camp with several SS men and almost 100 Hiwi guards. The quarry, spread over {{an area of}} , {{supplied}} road construction material for German military use and {{was part of the}} strategic road-building programme in the war with the Soviet Union. It was equipped with a mechanical digger for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often killed prisoners by [...] "taking shots at <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> partridges". A widely feared overseer was Untersturmführer Franz Schwarz, who executed prisoners with a pickaxe or hammer.|$|E
500|$|After Pitman's capture, he was {{marched to}} Richmond {{in a weak}} {{physical}} state. He was imprisoned in the Confederate Libby Prison and Belle Isle, which were notoriously harsh prisons. Pitman's letters home described his place of incarceration as the [...] "Pen" [...] where [...] "the filthy meat [...] thrown to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dogs". The condition of his incarceration including the shortage of food, lack of sanitation, overcrowding and his physical weakness made him susceptible to virulent diseases present in the Confederate prisons. Carter described how the prisons [...] "wore out the brave spirit". During a prisoner exchange, Pitman was released by the Confederate Army at City Point, Virginia, on December12, 1862, and then sent to Camp Parole, Annapolis. Suffering from complications due to the conditions of his imprisonment, he contracted [...] "lung fever", which was perhaps pneumonia. Carter wrote later how his friend had [...] "linger feebly a few weeks, like the flickering of an expiring flame, then quietly pass away to an eternal life". Pitman died at Camp Parole on February27, 1863, just weeks short of his eighteenth birthday. According to historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance, Pitman [...] "has the unfortunate {{distinction of being the}} only known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War".|$|E
500|$|Twitterbots {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, [...] "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs." [...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E

500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|E
500|$|The three lead {{characters}} do {{not have}} last names because [...] "they are not normal people". Romanek believed that the three main characters act with great dignity. He noted {{that they are not}} materialistic or looking for power, but just desire to acknowledge their love for each other and stay close in their friendship. An example he mentioned was how Ruth tries to seek redemption by attempting to set right a big mistake she had made. What he found the most moving aspect of the film was the [...] "graceful place of acceptance that Kathy comes to at the end". Child actors Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe play the younger versions of Never Let Me Gos three lead actors. Hawkins, who co-starred with Mulligan in An Education, had a supporting role as Miss Lucy, who is a teacher at an isolated English boarding school where the students slowly become {{aware of the fact that}} they are feared by people in the outside world. Charlotte Rampling portrays Miss Emily, a schoolmaster who presides over the orphanage at Hailsham. Richard was cast as an administrator, who is known as Madame. The character has been conducting an ongoing project that aims to analyse the students’ characters and psychologies, which has been compared to treating <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> subjects in an experiment. Riseborough's casting in Never Let Me Go was announced in April 2009 by Screen Daily; she had a small role in the film.|$|E

2500|$|The media gave {{a lot of}} {{attention}} to the innings at the time. Some still regard it as the most explosive innings ever. Nottinghamshire's George Gunn said Alletson had hit the ball harder than anyone he had seen.

As a result, a Japanese person without adequate knowledge of Chinese would not understand his or her name when it is spoken in Chinese. Simply porting the kanji into Chinese and reading <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Chinese is also different from the usual Chinese practice of approximating foreign names with similar-sounding Chinese characters.|$|E
2500|$|His beliefs {{attempted}} to steer a middle course between idealistic metaphysics and materialism. He differed with metaphysicians because they [...] "reified" [...] words and treated <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> realities, and he objected to materialism because it ignored or overlooked {{the importance of}} form. Carus emphasized form by conceiving of the divinity as a cosmic order. He objected to any monism which sought {{the unity of the}} world, not in the unity of truth, but in the oneness of a logical assumption of ideas. He referred to such concepts as henism, not monism.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{supporters}} of same-sex marriage {{state that the}} word 'marriage' matters and that the term 'civil union' (and its equivalents) do not convey the emotional meaning or bring the respect that comes with marriage. Former US Solicitor General and attorney in the Perry v.

2500|$|Philosophical Investigations is {{the primary}} text used in {{discussing}} family resemblances, even though the topic appears also in other works by Wittgenstein, notably The Brown Book.

Hans Sluga has observed that [...] "the notion of family resemblance... draws on two quite different sets of ideas, two different vocabularies, but treats <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> one and the same. The first is the vocabulary of kinship, of descent, {{of some sort of}} real and causal connection.. the second is that of similarity, resemblance, affinity and correspondence." ...|$|E

When he went on military campaigns against rival warlords, he often left Zhang Fan and Bing Yuan behind to guard his base together with his son and heir apparent, Cao Pi.
