5|$|In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> had an {{unexpectedly}} strong season. Their chief rivals, the Yomiuri Giants, lost their star player Hideki Matsui to the New York Yankees, while <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> saw {{the return of}} pitcher Hideki Irabu back to NPB after playing with the Texas Rangers. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that the Curse of the Colonel had finally been broken. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> lost the Japan Series, this time to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, so the curse is presumably intact.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> led the AL Central {{for periods}} {{at the start}} of the season in April, {{ultimately}} tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same stretch to tie <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45–44 but the Twins came back in the second half going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> went 38–37 over the same span. The Twins won 11 of the two teams' 18 match-ups that season prior to the tie-breaker.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers,</b> their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> circled Atlas like a snake. Although Atlas looked {{formidable}} and brave, {{he could}} not follow <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> motions. Then <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> charged at Atlas. Atlas used his claws, but he missed <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> and went over with it. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> frantically pawed Atlas' body, using both fore and hind paws, for forty seconds. However, Atlas managed to throw <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> off, but then Atlas tried to roar, before falling down and dying.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> crawled forward, {{crouched}} {{flat and}} calculated the distance for a spring at Atlas. Atlas' tail lashed at its sides, as it gave a deep roar {{and waited for}} <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> to attack. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> sprang at Atlas, which then rose up on its hind legs, and crashed with <b>the</b> <b>tiger.</b> <b>The</b> two yelled, snarled and rolled over on the ground. They regained their feet and shook to be free. When they parted from the clinch, Atlas swung his right, clawed, paw on <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> head, ripping its ear, and scratching off skin. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> rolled off. Atlas went to get it, and swiped its paw, but <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> managed to twist away from Atlas' paw-swipe, and escaped. Then Atlas advanced, but <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> retreated.|$|R
5|$|After {{succumbing to}} {{financial}} pressures in 1927, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> were briefly revived in the mid-1930s {{as a minor}} professional club. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> competed {{for a total of}} eleven seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. Five Tigers players would later gain election to the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After the 2009 season, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> began {{shopping}} Granderson {{to other}} franchises {{in an effort}} to reduce their payroll. The Yankees acquired Granderson in a three-team trade on December 9. In the deal, the Yankees received Granderson while sending Phil Coke and centerfielder Austin Jackson to Detroit. Also, the Arizona Diamondbacks received Yankees pitcher Ian Kennedy and Tigers pitcher Edwin Jackson in return for young pitchers Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth, who joined <b>the</b> <b>Tigers.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> {{defeated}} the visiting UMass Minutemen, 10–7. Princeton {{was led by}} Mark Kovler's six-point effort. The game was the final in the collegiate career of Minutemen goalkeeper Doc Schneider who led his team to the 2006 championship game as a freshman. His opposite number, Princeton's Tyler Fiorito, became just the second freshman goalkeeper to start an NCAA tournament game for <b>the</b> <b>Tigers.</b>|$|E
30|$|In Asian folklore, {{there is}} a story about a fox and a <b>tiger.</b> <b>The</b> fox told <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> that <b>the</b> fox was a king. To prove this, the fox said he would stroll in the forest and <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> must stay behind him. Many animals ran away when they saw <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> behind <b>the</b> fox. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> thought they ran because of the fox. This story {{indicates}} that the fox behaved like <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> by borrowing <b>the</b> <b>tiger’s</b> identity. This is analogous to the publication of scientific articles because of errant governmental policies.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> {{jumped into}} <b>the</b> air, landing on Atlas' back, though Atlas was about 20.0 ft away. At first, Atlas looked disgusted, {{but then it}} forced <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> to <b>the</b> wall of the arena. However, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> did not decide to escape again, rather, it ran, with its head nearly at the ground, towards Atlas' legs. Despite a crash, <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> head did not shake, and the two cats rose on their hind legs. For at least three minutes, they {{exchanged}} right and left paw-swipes. <b>The</b> <b>tiger's</b> paw-swipes were faster than those of Atlas, outnumbering Atlas' paw-swipes three-to-one. Atlas' paw-swipes had been heavier, inflicting deeper gashes on <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> hide, than those of <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> to Atlas' hide.|$|R
5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally. Their passing defense {{was not nearly as}} successful. On average, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|Created ostensibly as {{an amateur}} team in hopes of {{competing}} for the Allan Cup, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> helped form the Western Canada Hockey League in 1921 {{to become the first}} major professional team in Calgary. In 1924, after winning both the league and Western Canadian championships, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> became the first Calgary based club to compete for the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their first}} {{loss of the}} season, the All-Americans {{challenged}} the Cleveland Tigers. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>Tigers,</b> Jimmy O'Donnell, helped with {{the foundation of the}} APFA. A total of 5,000 fans showed up to the game. The only score of the game came in the third quarter. Anderson scored an 8-yard rushing touchdown. This loss for <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> would be their final game of the season.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> was not branded a man eater {{because all}} the human kills had taken place within the forest area. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> had also not eaten the flesh of three of its alleged victims and had {{continued}} to kill its natural prey. Accordingly, {{it was decided to}} capture instead of shooting <b>the</b> <b>tiger.</b> <b>The</b> National <b>Tiger</b> Conservation Authority and a team from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) assisted forest officials in the capture of <b>the</b> <b>tiger.</b> On 2 September 2010 Avijit Bhawal of the WTI fired a dart at <b>the</b> <b>tiger.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> was alarmed by an inadvertent shot fired by a forest guard, causing it to move, deflecting the dart. On 14 October, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> was tracked to a clump of Prosopis juliflora, where it was taking cover near Nagla Hira Singh village in Farrukhabad forest division. Three darts were successfully fired to tranquilize it. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> sedation, a large crowd of people had gathered around the clump of bushes where <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> was hidden and began pelting the animal with stones. One person was mauled severely and several others suffered injuries when <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> attacked them. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> was sent to Lucknow Zoo on 15 October where it {{came to be known as}} Farrukhabadi by the zoo staff because of the fact that it was captured in the Farrukhabad forest division. Due to a lack of available space at the Lucknow Zoo, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> was moved to the Kanpur zoo on 24 October.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> {{is one of}} {{the animals}} {{displayed}} on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> was <b>the</b> emblem of the Chola Dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners. The seals of several Chola copper coins show <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> <b>the</b> Pandyan emblem fish and the Chera emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh have motifs of <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> bow and some indistinct marks. <b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> symbol of Chola Empire was later adopted by <b>the</b> Liberation <b>Tigers</b> of Tamil Eelam and <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> became a symbol of the unrecognised state of Tamil Eelam and Tamil independence movement.|$|R
5|$|Gromek {{remained}} in the spot starter role with the Indians until 1953, when he was traded to <b>the</b> <b>Tigers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> used him solely as a starting pitcher, and had 18 wins in his first full season with them in 1954. He played two more full seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Tigers,</b> and retired during the 1957 season. Gromek then became a player-manager for the Erie Sailors for one year, became a car insurance sales representative after his retirement, and died in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Kinsler {{was traded}} to the Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder in a {{one-for-one}} trade of All-Stars, with <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> sending Texas $30 million to cover part of the difference in the players' salaries. <b>The</b> <b>Tigers</b> gave Kinsler permission to honor Alan Trammell by wearing #3.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, <b>the</b> <b>Tigers</b> had {{a rematch}} with the Pros. Playing {{in front of}} 8,000 fans, the Pros allowed their first and only points of the year from a 50-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Mark Devlin to Tuffy Conn and an extra point by Al Pierotti in the third quarter. Pollard had a 20-yard rushing touchdown {{in the second quarter}} and Copley made an extra point to tie the game at 7–7, making it the second tie of the season for <b>the</b> <b>Tigers.</b> The final score of the game was a 14–0 victory for <b>the</b> <b>Tigers.</b>|$|E
50|$|After resting {{for a few}} moments, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> {{tried to}} circle Atlas, with Atlas looking worried, as his rushes did not stop <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> at first. Then, sensing an opportunity, Atlas charged, but <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> avoided <b>the</b> charge, and jumped onto Atlas’ back again. Their bodies, bloodied and dirtied by the dust, rolled halfway across the arena. Atlas shook himself off <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> and {{delivered}} right swipes. One of the swipes dealt a blow to <b>the</b> <b>tiger,</b> causing it to stagger and retreat.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tiger</b> sprang onto Atlas, who now staggered. It bit Atlas' nose, {{then tried}} to bite Atlas' throat. However, the mane saved Atlas' neck, so <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> bite did not suffocate Atlas. Instead, as they {{wrestled}} much, <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> managed to get hair in its mouth, and the hair interfered with <b>the</b> <b>tiger's</b> respiration, so it had to release its hold on Atlas, allowing Atlas to deliver a massive left uppercut. The uppercut caused <b>the</b> <b>tiger</b> to stumble to about 20.0 ft away.|$|R
