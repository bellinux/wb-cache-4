5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
25|$|But racial {{tensions}} worsened {{on the night}} of July 22–23. Initially, the night was quieter than previous nights. The police and National Guard largely deployed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as they put out blazes.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the writing}} of {{characters}} in vertical columns, from top to bottom, is {{for the most part}} carried over from the bamboo books to oracle bone inscriptions. In some instances lines are written horizontally so as to match the text to divinatory cracks, or columns of text rotate 90 degrees in mid-stream, but these are exceptions to the normal pattern of writing, and inscriptions were never read bottom to top. The vertical columns of text in Chinese writing are traditionally ordered from right to left; this pattern is found on bronze inscriptions from the Shang dynasty onward. Oracle bone inscriptions, however, are often arranged so that the columns begin near the centerline of the shell or bone, and move <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> such that the two sides are ordered in mirror-image fashion.|$|E

As each master carrier travels through the channel, it collides with and collects the other carriers one-by-one. This growing group of carriers is pushed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> stage, causing the fabric to bunch near <b>the</b> curtain's moving <b>edge.</b>|$|R

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Leccinum manzanitae are {{sometimes}} massive, occasionally reaching weights of several pounds. The cap is [...] in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion-shaped (pulvinate). The {{surface of the}} cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's flesh is [...] thick, white when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, Nurmi {{was persuaded}} by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former {{chairman}} of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and Sports Illustrated wrote that [...] "his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the track." [...] After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower. In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the ship}} was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey {{was one of several}} ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's {{aircraft}} tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge {{around the edge of the}} carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, [...] "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard." ...|$|E

500|$|The caps {{of young}} {{mushrooms}} are initially egg-shaped to conical, expanding to become [...] bell-shaped {{and up to}} 2cm (0.8in) in diameter. Initially, {{the margin of the}} cap is rolled inwards; it typically assumes a lighter color than the centre of the cap surface. Dark brown in color, the mushroom is distinguished by the presence of white speckles or scales on the cap and stem; these scales may disappear when they become sloughed off or washed away by rain, which can make the species hard to recognise. The thick gills have an adnate attachment to the stem (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem), and are white to light grey in colour, paler <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> There are about 24–28 gills extending completely from the cap margin to the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills does do not extend fully from the margin to the stem). The thin stem is up to 4cm (1.6in) high and 0.3cm (0.12in) wide, and does not have a ring. Young specimens will typically have whitish scales at the base; later, these will slough off and a felt-like whitish mycelium may be apparent. The mushroom have no distinctive odour. The spore print is white or cream. The edibility of the mushroom has not been reported.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reverse of}} the seal {{on the left}} {{features}} a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the Eye of Providence within a triangle. At {{the base of the}} pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of American independence from Britain. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, [...] "ANNUIT COEPTIS," [...] meaning [...] "He favors our undertaking." [...] At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming [...] "NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM" [...] meaning [...] "New Order of the Ages" [...] that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bill.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy rain {{during the}} night of 3–4 November {{triggered}} lahars with mixtures of water and rock debris cascading down the Kuning, Gendol, Woro, Boyong, Krasak and Opak Rivers {{on the slopes of}} the volcano. A bridge was destroyed and riverbanks damaged. The eruption at 05:55 was reported as being five times stronger than the initial eruption on 26 October 2010. On 4 November Merapi had been erupting for 24 hours without stopping. Pyroclastic flows of [...] spread as far as [...] from the crater reaching <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the then [...] exclusion zone, and lava flowed into the mountain's rivers.

2500|$|The {{digital data}} on a CD begins {{at the center of}} the disc and {{proceeds}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is [...] in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc. This is a myth according to Kees Immink, as the code format had not yet been decided in May 1980. The adoption of EFM one month later would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100mm. The 120mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including Super Audio CD, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc. The 80mm diameter discs ("Mini CDs") can hold up to 24 minutes of music or 210MiB.|$|E
2500|$|The obverse of {{the seal}} {{on the right}} {{features}} a bald eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States. Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle's breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, {{the stars and stripes}} stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM," [...] a Latin phrase meaning [...] "Out of many , one ," [...] a de facto motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the bill. [...] A plate position (check) number is normally found {{to the left of the}} eagle.|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, the searchers {{found the}} group's {{abandoned}} and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, {{the student who}} found the tent, said [...] "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind." [...] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a nearby woods, {{on the opposite side}} of the pass, [...] to the north-east. [...] However, after [...] these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest's edge, under a large cedar, the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire, along with the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the cedar and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent. They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.|$|E
