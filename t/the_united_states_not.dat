5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>not</b> yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The Slaughter-House Cases, , was {{the first}} United States Supreme Court {{interpretation}} of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment which had recently been enacted.

However, federal rights of citizenship were then few, such {{as the right to}} travel between states and to use navigable rivers; the amendment did not protect the far broader range of rights covered by state citizenship. In effect, the amendment was interpreted to convey limited protection pertinent to a small minority of rights.|$|E
