At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to do this, as Julia had made advances <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E

These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E

5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. As a gesture of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E
5|$|Years later, after Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him again, but Rodrigues refuses, {{saying he}} is no longer a priest. Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch he claims to have won while {{gambling}} containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated. In his hand is the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he first came to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E

He takes her away to Ketti, where he is working as a school teacher. He takes her to his residence, where he protects her and also pampers her like a child. Viji, as she is called by Cheenu, has completely forgotten her past and becomes very close <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> Viji accidentally spills ink over Cheenu's documents, angering him, their relationship is threatened, but they reconcile. Later, a local woodcutter named Nataraj lusts for Viji and nearly assaults her, but she manages to save herself. When she tells Cheenu about it, he becomes livid with rage and almost kills Nataraj, but is stopped by his neighbours who were informed of the incident by Viji. Meanwhile, the wife of Cheenu's headmaster is attracted to Cheenu, though he does not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and {{stay in touch with}} football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E
5|$|Simão de Andrade, {{brother to}} Fernão Pires, sailed from Malacca to China {{with a small}} crew on three junks in August 1519. Simão {{immediately}} made a bad impression upon the Chinese when he built a fort {{at the center of}} Tuen Mun, an island designated for all foreigners to trade. Soon after, Simão ceremoniously executed a Portuguese and barred other foreigners (mostly Siamese and other South East Asians) from trading on the island, which drew even more attention <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> a Chinese official visited the island and began reasserting Ming authority over it, Simão became aggressive and hit him, knocking the official's hat off.|$|E

At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E

However, Olaf arrives in disguise as a man named Stephano. The orphans attempt to warn Montgomery, and he believes to an extent. Montgomery believes Stephano is after a large viper in his museum, which despite its looks, is actually very gentle. He is discovered dead shortly after, and the orphans cannot prove that Stephano is responsible for Montgomery's death. They are almost taken back <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> Sunny proves the viper's innocence when it fondles and licks her, disproving its hostile nature. Stephano flees the scene, ridding all proof of his disguise as the police pursue him.|$|E

Vijay hands over the disc to DeSilva. When DeSilva murders Singhania, the police arrive and arrest Vijay. DeSilva is killed in the shoot-out, which is unfortunate for Vijay because DeSilva {{was the only person}} who could prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against Vijay and the group engage in a fight. Vijay escapes and reconciles with Roma to recover the disc and prove his innocence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he took the throne.|$|E

5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Clay learns that Rip {{also had a}} fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her. When Clay discovers that Julian is {{currently}} Rain's boyfriend, he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> Julian is then found murdered, Rain confronts Clay {{about his role in}} the affair and is raped by him in response. He later receives a video of Julian's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay as a means to implicate him in the crime. The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy, perpetrated by Clay. Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this, for Julian's death, or for exploiting and raping Rain. In the last scenes, it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay. In return for his giving her what she wants, she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian's murder.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, a Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) was formed, {{comprising}} 12 generals including Đính, each of {{whom had}} equal voting power. They appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of civilians led by Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, {{who had been the}} titular Vice President under Diệm. Đính was initially made interior minister, but Thơ was said to have personally opposed the appointment. Eventually Minh, the head of the military junta, struck a compromise whereby Đính was made Security Minister and Administrative Affairs, which partially covered the interior ministry. He was the 2nd Deputy Chairman of the MRC behind Minh and Đôn. However, tension persisted as Thơ's civilian government was plagued by infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Đôn and Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the civilian government, but as members of the MRC they were superior <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> Thơ gave a cabinet order with which the generals disagreed, they went to the MRC and gave a counter-order. Đính and the new national police chief, General Xuân, were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. The junta performed indecisively and was heavily criticised, especially Minh, who was viewed as being too apathetic towards his country's situation. During the MRC's tenure, South Vietnam suffered more and more losses to the Vietcong.|$|E
