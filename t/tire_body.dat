50|$|There are {{two main}} {{processes}} used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearograph to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires {{over the life of}} the <b>tire</b> <b>body.</b> Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.|$|E
50|$|Bias tire (or cross ply) {{construction}} utilizes {{body ply}} cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles {{in the range}} of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds. This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles. It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.|$|E
30|$|Analysis of the ME-Wheel force {{shows that}} the radial {{stiffness}} of the ME-Wheel is mainly determined by the structural and mechanical properties of the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> and the hinge unit. The greater the radial stiffness of the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body,</b> the greater the stiffness of the ME-Wheel. In addition, the rigidity of the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> depends on the stiffness of the combined elastic rings, number of clamping rings, and size of flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> structure. On the hinge unit, its stiffness also directly affects the overall stiffness of the ME-Wheel.|$|E

30|$|When the ME-Wheel is {{subjected}} to lateral forces, the mechanical connection (hinge unit, clamping ring) of the ME-Wheel will transmit the lateral force to the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body,</b> which {{will lead to a}} certain degree of elastic deformation of the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> in the grounding area.

The {{theory of}} tire wear {{computation}} is researched, and steady state transfer analysis and steady state rolling slippage are analyzed and deduced; the uniform wear rate of discrete node on the tire tread pattern is induced based on adhesive wear mechanism. <b>Tire</b> <b>body</b> model and tread pattern model are established by using Neo-Hooken constitutive model and linear elastic model, {{and the whole}} tire model is formed. Tire wear simulation analysis is preceded with combination of Abaqus Arbitary Lagrangian and Eulerian (ALE) method and the user subroutine programmed according to tire wear computation model. Tire wear of different mileage under free rolling state, tire wear under breaking condition and driving condition are compared, and slip angle, load and tire pressure’s impact on tire wear are analyzed...|$|E

The experiments were carried out using single wheel tester in soil bin condition.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation, {{and testing of}} an integrated system for improving dose homogeneity in total body irradiation (TBI).

The system proposed in this paper, whose main goal is to compensate for tissues hetero- geneities, is made up of a translating bed, a linear accelerator, a vision system for body thickness assessment, a dynamically con- trolled water filter, and a main control unit. The water filter, placed between the X-ray source and the patient, is made up of an array of 70 small water containers (cells). The water level in each cell is con- trolled in real time, so as to modify the dose distribution both in the transverse direction and in the longitudinal direction. A prototype of the water filter system was implemented and tested, achieving good results in terms of dose uniformity...|$|E

30|$|In recent years, Zhao et al. [12] {{developed}} a novel non-pneumatic wheel called the mechanical elastic wheel (ME-Wheel). The ME-Wheel {{consists of three}} parts, the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body,</b> hinge unit and suspension hub. In order to improve the adaptability of military vehicles in complex environment, the ME-Wheel is designed with a statically indeterminate structure. Compared with the conventional pneumatic tire, the ME-Wheel will not have potential risk factors such as flat tire or leakage. Moreover, the double buffered damping structure adopted by the ME-Wheel gives it excellent comfort. The ME-Wheel’s structure and vehicle ride comfort was analyzed by Wang et al. [13]. Wang et al. [14] analyzed the relationship among the excitation frequency, radial deformation, bending stiffness of combined elastic rings, and combined elastic rings’ laminated structure parameters. Zang et al. [15 – 17] analyzed the influence of conditions on the radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel. Li et al. [18] studied the mechanical properties of the ME-Wheels with Laplace transform and obtained {{the relationship between the}} tangential deformation and bending angle of the combined elastic rings. Du et al. [19] established a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element wheel–soil interaction model, and simulations with different rotational speeds of the ME-Wheel were conducted.|$|E
30|$|Machining and {{installation}} errors are unavoidable in mechanical structures. However, {{the effect of}} errors on radial stiffness of the mechanical elastic wheel (ME-Wheel) is not considered in previous studies. To this end, the interval mathematical model and interval finite element model of the ME-Wheel were both established and compared with bench test results. The intercomparison {{of the influence of}} the machining {{and installation}} errors on the ME-Wheel radial stiffness revealed good consistency among the interval mathematical analysis, interval finite element simulation, and bench test results. Within the interval range of the ME-Wheel machining and installation errors, parametric analysis of the combined elastic rings was performed at different initial radial rigidity values. The results showed that the initial radial stiffness of the flexible <b>tire</b> <b>body</b> significantly influenced the ME-Wheel radial stiffness, and the inverse relationship between the hinge unit length or suspension hub and the radial stiffness was nonlinear. The radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel is predicted by using the interval algorithm for the first time, and the regularity of the radial stiffness between the error and the load on the ME-Wheel is studied, which will lay the foundation for the exact study of the ME-Wheel dynamic characteristics in the future.|$|E
