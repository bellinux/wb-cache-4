25|$|The Scopes trial {{had both}} short- and {{long-term}} {{effects in the}} teaching of science in schools in the United States. Though often upheld as a blow for <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> in the form of waning public opinion, the victory was not complete. Though the ACLU had taken on the trial as a cause, in the wake of Scopes' conviction, they were unable to find any volunteers to take on the Butler law and by 1932, the ACLU gave up. The anti-evolutionary legislation was not challenged again until 1965 and in the meantime William Jennings Bryan's cause was taken up by a number of organizations including the Bryan Bible League and the Defenders of the Christian Faith.|$|E
25|$|Following the Iranian Revolution, Bahraini Shia fundamentalists in 1981 orchestrated {{a failed}} coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have {{installed}} a Shia cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjat al-Islam Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. The Bahraini government unofficially regarded the coup as Iran attempting to overthrow their Sunni government. Iran denied all knowledge saying <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> were inspired by the Iranian revolution but had received no support from Iran. Fearful of a recurrence, the episode caused Bahrain to crack down on its Shia population putting thousands into jail and further souring relations with Shia Iran. Recently the countries are beginning to enjoy closer relations again and have engaged in many joint economic ventures. Iran has been severely critical of Bahrain hosting the US navy Fifth Fleet within the Persian Gulf.|$|E

25|$|Israeli forces {{advancing}} {{along the}} coast also completed the capture of Sidon. Paratroopers attacked the Kasbah while a combined force of Golani Brigade infantry and tanks attacked Ain al-Hilweh. The Kasbah was secured in three days; the paratroopers advanced cautiously and managed to take it without suffering any casualties. However, the fighting at Ain al-Hilweh was to prove some of the fiercest of the entire war. The camp was heavily fortified and defended by PLO fighters and Islamic fundamentalists. The defenders fought fiercely over every alley and house, with civilians who wanted to surrender shot by <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists.</b> The Israeli advance was slow and was supported by massive air and artillery bombardment. The IDF employed its previous tactics of urging civilians to leave with loudspeakers before attacking an area. It took about eight days the camp to fall, with the battle culminating in a last stand by the defenders at the camp mosque, which was blown up by the IDF.|$|E
500|$|In 1922, {{prominent}} New York minister Harry Emerson Fosdick (who was Baptist but {{serving as}} pastor of New York's First Presbyterian Church by special arrangement) preached a sermon entitled [...] "Shall <b>the</b> <b>Fundamentalists</b> Win?", challenging what he {{perceived to be}} {{a rising tide of}} intolerance against liberal (or [...] "modernist") theology within the denomination. In response, conservative Presbyterian minister Clarence E. Macartney preached a sermon called [...] "Shall Unbelief Win?", in which he warned that liberalism would lead to [...] "a Christianity without worship, without God, and without Jesus Christ". J. Gresham Machen of Princeton Theological Seminary also responded to Fosdick with his 1923 book Christianity and Liberalism, arguing that liberalism and Christianity were two different religions.|$|E
500|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin. It is {{a profile of}} an Illinois Christian {{fundamentalist}} school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and [...] "empathetic". He presents <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that {{their job is to}} prepare students for this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought. In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.|$|E

500|$|In his exposé Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981–1987, {{journalist}} Bob Woodward {{chronicles the}} role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North. According to Woodward, then–Director of the CIA William J. Casey admitted to him in February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds to the contras. The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke, and, according to his wife, was unable to communicate. On May 6, 1987, William Casey died the day after Congress began its public hearings on Iran–Contra. Independent Counsel, Lawrence Walsh later wrote: [...] "Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion. The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [...] North." [...] Gust Avrakodos, who was responsible for the arms supplies to the Afghans at this time, was aware of the operation as well and strongly opposed it, in particular the diversion of funds allotted to the Afghan operation. According to his Middle Eastern experts the operation was pointless because the moderates in Iran were {{not in a position to}} challenge <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists.</b> However, he was overruled by Clair George.|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists,</b> who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biblical scholar Géza Vermes {{analyzes}} {{this subject}} in his book, The Resurrection. He concludes {{that there are}} eight possible theories to explain the [...] "resurrection of Jesus". Vermes outlines his boundaries as follows, I have discounted the two extremes that are not susceptible to rational judgment, the blind faith of the fundamentalist believer and the out-of-hand rejection of the inveterate skeptic. <b>The</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> accept the story, not as written down in the New Testament texts, but as reshaped, transmitted, and interpreted by Church tradition. They smooth down the rough edges and abstain from asking tiresome questions. The unbelievers, in turn, treat the whole Resurrection story as the figment of early Christian imagination.

2500|$|In a 2007 {{article in}} Reason magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be {{defeated}} and that [...] "we {{are at war}} with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars."

[...] She stated {{that the majority of}} Muslims aren't [...] "moderates" [...] and they must radically alter their religion. Max Rodenbeck, writing in The New York Review of Books, notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and [...] "mellowed," [...] as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls [...] "Medina Muslims", meaning <b>the</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: [...] "These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it." [...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
