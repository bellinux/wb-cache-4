5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable <b>to</b> <b>perfect</b> its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E

The score is saved and shown alongside the song in the select screen; over time, as the song is replayed, it shows only the highest score.|$|E

5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time <b>to</b> <b>perfect</b> the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 and set out <b>to</b> <b>perfect</b> and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker {{in his own right}} using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time <b>to</b> <b>perfect</b> the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit.

A real X is n-generic relative <b>to</b> some <b>perfect</b> tree if there exists such a T. We first show that for every number n all but countably many reals are n-generic relative <b>to</b> some <b>perfect</b> tree.

5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued <b>to</b> <b>perfect</b> the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E
