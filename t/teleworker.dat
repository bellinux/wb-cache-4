5000|$|Managers {{may view}} the <b>teleworker</b> as {{experiencing}} {{a drop in}} productivity {{during the first few}} months. This drop occurs as [...] "the employee, his peers, and the manager adjust to the new work regimen". The drop could also be due to inadequate office setup. Additionally, a 1999 study claimed that [...] "70 minutes of each day in a regular office are wasted by interruptions, yakking around the photocopier, and other distractions". Over the long term, though, surveys found that productivity of the <b>teleworker</b> will climb; over two-thirds of employers report increased productivity among telecommuters, according to a 2008 survey. Traditional line managers are accustomed to managing by observation and not necessarily by results. This causes a serious obstacle in organizations attempting to adopt telecommuting. Liability and workers' compensation can become serious issues as well. Weaker relationships between job dimensions and job outcomes, such as job performance and absenteeism, may explain why the results regarding performance and telework are conflicting. Some studies have found that telework increases productivity in workers and leads to higher supervisor ratings of performance and higher performance appraisals. However, another study found that professional isolation in teleworkers led to a decrease in job performance, especially for those who spent more time teleworking and engaged in fewer face-to-face interactions. Thus, similar to job attitudes, {{the amount of time spent}} teleworking may also influence the relationship between telework and job performance.|$|E

A 2008 study found that more time spent telecommuting decreased the perception of productivity of the <b>teleworker</b> in the eyes of management. Hygiene factors, such as work conditions, may improve when teleworking such that teleworkers have the flexibility to work in a variety of locations. Thus, telework has different work motivating factors and dissatisfying factors than office work.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to compare}} pre-telework anxieties, {{expectations}} and motivators reported by 394 <b>teleworkers</b> with their corresponding actual experiences of telework. Design/methodology/approach – Based on an organizational survey, 394 samples were generated {{who had been}} teleworking for less than 12 months {{at the time of}} the survey. By using ? 2 tests, comparisons were made between pre-telework expectations and post-telework outcomes reported by <b>teleworkers</b> with different characteristics such as gender, job type, the presence of dependent children, and working hours spent at home. Findings – The study found that prior to adopting telework sampled <b>teleworkers</b> tended to underestimate positive and overestimate negative experience of telework. It further demonstrated some statistically significant differences in pre-telework expectations and post-telework outcomes reported by different groups of <b>teleworkers.</b> For example, female <b>teleworkers</b> were more likely to report that telework made it easier to cope with caring responsibilities. Sales and marketing <b>teleworkers</b> were more likely to report reduced visibility and career development. Practical implications – Implementing and maintaining successful telework schemes requires managers to take heed of the emotional aspects that accompany the use of such flexible work arrangements. Furthermore, career implications and the development of appropriate support structures for <b>teleworkers</b> need to be taken into account. Originality/value – The contribution of this paper lies in the comparative approach between pre-telework expectations and post-telework outcomes. It compares different social and occupational groups. </p...|$|R

In 2006, a United States Department of Veterans Affairs employee's stolen laptop represented what was described as [...] "potentially the largest loss of Social Security numbers to date". While {{he was not a}} telecommuter, this incident brought attention to the risks inherent in working off-site. Ninety percent of executives charged with security in large organizations feel that telework is not a security concern. They are more concerned with the occasional work that's taken out of the office by non-teleworkers because they lack the training, tools, and technologies that teleworkers receive. In other studies regarding Job Characteristics Theory, job feedback seemed to have the strongest relationship with overall job satisfaction compared to other job characteristics. While teleworking, communication is not as immediate or rich as face-to-face interactions. Less feedback when teleworking is associated with lower job engagement. Thus, when perceived supervisor support and relationship quality between leaders and teleworkers decreases, job satisfaction of the <b>teleworker</b> decreases. [...] The importance of manager communication with teleworkers is made clear in a study that found that individuals have lower job satisfaction when their managers telework.|$|E
40|$|New {{forms of}} work {{organisation}} such as telework, {{and more recently}} virtual teams and network organisations, suggest that distance work relationships will become increasingly widespread in the future. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to theory development in this relatively new area of study. The focus of this thesis is on the exploration of <b>teleworker</b> – manager work relationships in telework settings. A framework for exploring work relationships in telework settings was developed from the organisational behaviour and telework literature. This framework guided {{the design of the}} study and the analysis of the interview data. Interviews were conducted with six <b>teleworker</b> – manager sets in four different organisations in Australia. Unique stories from each of the cases have been compiled {{from the perspective of the}} <b>teleworker</b> and the perspective of the manager. An analysis of each of the <b>teleworker</b> – manager work relationships was undertaken using the concepts from the framework. The findings from the analysis have been used to develop grounded theory on <b>teleworker</b> – manager work relationships in telework settings. The grounded theory proposes that when an employee commences telework that their work relationship with their manager shifts from an emphasis on performing and control behaviours (stage 1), to an emphasis on authority and autonomy behaviours (stage 2), and finally to an emphasis on commitment and support behaviours (stage 3). Of particular interest in this study is the notion of dual work systems; the newly established telework system and the existing work system of the employer organisation. In contrast to the existing domain of the employing organisation, the telework domain is established by the <b>teleworker</b> in a way that fits with their particular life circumstances. As a result, the <b>teleworker</b> and their manager operate two synchronous work relationships – the work relationship in the telework setting and the work relationship in the co-located setting. The dynamics found in the telework relationships in this study are related to the <b>teleworker</b> and their manager learning how to relate to each other within these dual work relationships...|$|E

Following a socio-technical systems approach, this study aims to examine the role of organisational social support and specific support for teleworkers in influencing <b>teleworker</b> wellbeing, the mediating role of social isolation, potentially resulting from a person-environment mismatch in these relationships, and possible differences in these relationships between low-intensity and hybrid teleworkers. Teleworkers' (n = 804) perceptions of support and telework outcomes (psychological strain, job satisfaction, and social isolation) were collected using an on-line survey of teleworking employees distributed within 28 New Zealand organisations where knowledge work was undertaken. Organisational social support and <b>teleworker</b> support was associated with increased job satisfaction and reduced psychological strain. Social isolation mediated the relationship between organisational social support and the two outcome variables, and some differences were observed in the structural relationships for hybrid and low-intensity <b>teleworker</b> sub-samples. These findings suggest that providing the necessary organisational and <b>teleworker</b> support is important for enhancing the teleworker-environment fit and thereby ensuring desirable telework outcomes...|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{information}} economy, {{brought about}} by the advances in information and communications technology, has led to significant changes in the work environment. Organisations and workers must be flexible and are required to adjust quickly to demands from external and internal market forces. Employees are expected to be knowledge workers who are not only computer literate, but information literate as well. The high demand for flexibility has led to a trend that allows workers to perform their duties in locations outside of their traditional workspace. This trend has been named teleworking or telecommuting. A literature study revealed similarities and differences between the work environment of the knowledge worker and that of the <b>teleworker.</b> Both the <b>teleworker</b> and the knowledge worker are interacting in an environment that consists of individual, group and organisational processes. These processes are interrelated and none of them can be viewed in isolation. The factors that influence the knowledge worker also affect the <b>teleworker,</b> but the extent and focus of the influence vary. The features of the work environment of the knowledge worker and the <b>teleworker</b> provided the context for investigating the information environment of both. The information environment of the knowledge worker revealed certain distinct features, such as the manner in which documents and information were managed and the systems that were used. These features were compared with the information environment of the <b>teleworker</b> through an investigation of teleworkers in South Africa. Although very few, if any, South African organisations were involved in formal teleworking programmes, it was possible to establish certain trends through employees who had an ad hoc arrangement with their organisations. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} information environment of the <b>teleworker</b> was somewhat similar to that of the knowledge worker, but certain distinctions also came to the fore.

40|$|Telework {{is growing}} as an {{alternate}} work arrangement in {{both public and}} private sectors. Advocates of this new form of working claim that telework enhances employee efficiency and reduces work-related expenses, such as overhead for businesses and travel expenses for employees. However, alternate work experiments not only redesign the physical workplace, but also restructure work itself. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of telework on the work done by information professionals. Through combined methods of participant observation, interviews, and diaries, the work of twenty pairs of teleworking and at-office library and information professionals, matched by job, was investigated. The study revealed that although <b>teleworkers</b> and at-office workers performed similar amounts of professional and clerical work, work processes differed between the two groups. <b>Teleworkers</b> were often missing the information and collegial interaction necessary to complete work tasks at home. As a results, <b>teleworkers</b> tried to cope by repeating parts of tasks at home and by dividing work tasks according to available resources. At-office workers often compensated for absent teleworking colleagues by performing additional work tasks or by helping <b>teleworkers</b> locate work-related information. These improvised means of working revealed that <b>teleworkers</b> in this study were not persons working alone with control over all aspects of their work. 1...|$|R

The study utilizes {{data obtained from}} the 2005 origin-destination survey conducted by TRANS, a joint transportation planning committee serving the National Capital Region of Canada. The study compares and explains the discretionary travel behavior of teleworkers relative to other population groups and identifies that the average <b>teleworker</b> travels 3 times farther than regular workers and 1. 7 times farther than non-workers for discretionary purposes.

The {{increase in the}} number of teleworking employees presented numerous challenges for federal managers attempting to establish social networks, teamwork, and organizational commitment for their employees. This study used the case study design with a socio-technical conceptual framework as the basis to explore the strategies managers used. Data were collected via semistructured interviews with federal managers of teleworkers located in the Midwest region of the United States. A coding strategy was employed to organize the transcripts from the interviews into themes, and methodological triangulation was utilized by comparing the interview data with data from federal teleworking documents. From these analyses, 10 themes emerged: group meetings, knowledge-sharing networks, management of teleworkers, <b>teleworker</b> agreements, <b>teleworker</b> equipment, challenge of team building, telework as a reward, limitation on days teleworked, training, and flexibility of teleworkers. Managers incorporating these themes into best practices could have the tools and strategies to effectively implement and manage teleworking programs by helping to improve organizational commitment, teamwork, and socialization. The strategies could also help alleviate the isolation that some federal teleworkers experience.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between employee telework and work attitudes, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, and perceived co-worker support. A web-based questionnaire was distributed to employees at five organizations. Surveys were completed by 1, 350 employees. A positive relationship was predicted between telework and overall job satisfaction, as mediated by perceived autonomy. Further, moderating effects of job level were predicted for the above relationships. A negative relationship was predicted between telework and perceived co-worker support, moderated by task interdependence. It was also predicted that <b>teleworkers</b> would {{report higher levels of}} affective commitment, and that this relationship would be mediated by perceived organizational support. Finally, it was predicted that <b>teleworkers</b> would report higher levels of continuance and normative organizational commitment than non-teleworkers, and that the telework-normative commitment relationship would be moderated by employee exchange ideology. The predicted relationships received mixed support. Time spent teleworking was found to be related to overall job satisfaction, and this relationship was mediated by perceived autonomy. Employee job level had no moderating effects. Time spent teleworking was also found to be related to perceived co-worker support, although the direction of the relationship was opposite what was predicted and no moderating effect of task interdependence was found. <b>Teleworkers</b> did report higher levels of perceived organizational support than non-teleworkers, as predicted, although <b>teleworkers</b> did not report higher levels of affective commitment.
