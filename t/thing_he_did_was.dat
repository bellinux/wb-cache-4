25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E

After the collision, Lifsh said that the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to try to lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. The EMS unit that {{arrived on the scene}} about three minutes after the accident said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23pm, followed by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.

[...] The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed {{his time in the}} TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E
500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up with a way to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E

Chugg was the eldest of four children, while his grandmother, Ella Chugg, was his [...] "best friend". He credits his {{great-grandfather}} with his idiosyncratic use of profanity [...] "the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> taught me to swear. And it's always been {{a major part of}} my delivery of things. There might have been one or two instance over the 40 years where I was probably out of order but in the main it's usually been because it needed to be done". He attended Glen Dhu Primary School and then Queechy High School.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable ways was {{demonstrated}} in the 1992 Olympics, when the Dream Team, including Jordan and Pippen, took on Croatia for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured Toni Kukoč, a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting {{to a degree that}} some of the Bulls found annoying. Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, {{it was as if they}} had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause." [...] Jordan would later be quoted as saying: [...] "The trade of Oakley was good, and the best <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted Earl Monroe for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Jones {{spiraled}} out of control. [...] Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot {{introduced him to}} cocaine before a show {{because he was too}} tired to perform. [...] The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. [...] During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. [...] He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. [...] Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. [...] In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. [...] Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call [...] "the Duck" [...] and [...] "the Old Man". [...] In his article [...] "The Devil In George Jones", Nick Tosches states, [...] "By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. [...] He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. [...] Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. [...] Upon his release in January 1980, the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> pick up a six-pack." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{held out}} to him half-heartedly the two bits of paper, one pinkish-brown, the other blue. Stephen {{saw that she was}} trembling.

But there was also in Stephen a certain primitive virility, pickled, it is true, at Cambridge, and in the Law Courts dried, but still preserving something of its possessive and assertive quality, and the second <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to say, [...] "No, I'm damned!" ...|$|E
