2500|$|Thus, if {{a person}} has several options, you can {{calculate}} the opportunity cost of choosing one. But can we calculate a universal opportunity cost, which would include all the options? The prevailing opinion was that the opportunity cost could not be applied outside of cases of limited resources. This led some economists to limit the object of economics to [...] "exceptional" [...] resource situations (an idea still present in all economics textbooks). Still unknown are the consequences that might follow from an economic science that has no fixed limits outside of the economic system, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> of goods.|$|E
2500|$|Methodologies {{and data}} sources. The Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) of WHO and UNICEF, {{which is the}} internationally {{accepted}} source for the measurement to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water supply and sanitation, relies on the compilation of various surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Cluster Indicators Surveys (MCIS)) to establish access rates. These surveys typically assess the availability of infrastructure, not service quality. The 2017 estimates for Burkina Faso thus indicate access rates to an at least basic water source of 79 percent in urban areas and 43 percent in rural areas. The Government relies on an entirely different approach, based {{on the concept of}} [...] "reasonable access". This concept differs from the JMP approach by taking into account aspects of service quality, such as waiting time and water quality. According to the government approach, the water access rates in 2005 were lower than under the JMP approach, standing at 74 percent in urban areas and 60 percent in rural areas. While the “reasonable access” approach is more sophisticated, it also faces greater challenges in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> of data.|$|E

In addition, private enterprises are significantly more liquidity-constrained than state-owned enterprises in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> cash flow while international joint ventures are the least liquidity-constrained in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> replacement capital. Furthermore, collective-owned enterprises are less liquidity-constrained than state-owned enterprises in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> cash flow.
