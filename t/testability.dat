25|$|Criticism of {{evolutionary}} psychology involves questions of <b>testability,</b> cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular {{functioning of the}} brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, {{as well as political}} and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{controversial}} philosophical {{origins of the}} concept, particularly its close association with logical positivism, operational definitions have undisputed practical applications. This is especially so {{in the social and}} medical sciences, where operational definitions of key terms are used to preserve the unambiguous empirical <b>testability</b> of hypothesis and theory. Operational definitions are also important in the physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|Maintainability {{includes}} {{concepts of}} modularity, understandability, changeability, <b>testability,</b> reusability, and transferability from one development team to another. These {{do not take}} the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.|$|E
25|$|Software {{functional}} {{quality is}} defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional requirements, identified for example using Voice of the Customer analysis (part of the Design for Six Sigma toolkit and/or documented through use cases) {{and the level of}} satisfaction experienced by end-users. The latter is referred as to as usability and is concerned with how intuitive and responsive the user interface is, how easily simple and complex operations can be performed, and how useful error messages are. Typically, software testing practices and tools ensure that a piece of software behaves in compliance with the original design, planned user experience and desired <b>testability,</b> i.e. a piece of software's disposition to support acceptance criteria.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{includes}} {{that it may}} {{be better}} to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor <b>testability.</b> Empirical evidence regarding the suggested reproductive success is lacking. Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of {{a very large number of}} adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small effect that it escapes natural selection. The personality is thought to be influenced by a very large number of genes and may be disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be a product of a high mutation load. Psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or side-effect, of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of {{the value}} of Darwin's theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, [...] "I have in the past {{described}} the theory as 'almost tautological' ... I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the <b>testability</b> and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} make a recantation." [...] His conclusion, later in the article is [...] "The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} this type was the comparative method, which was developed over many years, culminating in the nineteenth century. [...] This uses a long word list and detailed study. [...] However, it {{has been criticized for}} example as being subjective, being informal, and lacking <b>testability.</b> The comparative method uses information from two or more languages and allows reconstruction of the ancestral language. The method of Internal reconstruction uses only a single language, with comparison of word variants, to perform the same function. Internal reconstruction is more resistant to interference but usually has a limited available base of utilizable words and is able to reconstruct only certain changes (those that have left traces as morphophonological variations).|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Popper {{gave the}} example of Einstein's {{gravitational}} theory, which predicted [...] "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted." [...] Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs {{had to be taken}} during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, [...] "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted." [...] Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or <b>testability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, {{inference}} to explanatory hypotheses for {{selection of}} those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, {{on the basis}} of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple {{in the sense of the}} [...] "facile and natural", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from [...] "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism [...] "the logic of abduction". Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its <b>testability</b> and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity. One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} link the <b>testability</b> with the {{difficulty}} to find potential faults in a system (if they exist) by testing it, a relevant measure to assess the <b>testability</b> is how many test cases are needed in each case to form a complete test suite (i.e. a test suite such that, after applying all test cases to the system, collected outputs will let us unambiguously determine whether the system is correct or not according to some specification). If this size is small, then the <b>testability</b> is high. Based on this measure, a <b>testability</b> hierarchy has been proposed.|$|E
