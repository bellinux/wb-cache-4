Anybody who is not proud of his race {{is not a man}} at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence {{was also}} a {{headquarters}} for a band of Redlegs that had initiated a particularly vicious jayhawking campaign in late March 1863. The purported objective of this group was to eliminate civilian support for the Confederate guerillas, but their tactics (executions, arson, and plundering) were employed rather indiscriminately. As one observer noted (apparently {{a member of the}} Fifth Kansas Cavalry), “I believe the Red Legs will kill any man in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> a good horse; and they have glorified themselves considerably over finishing some unarmed sympathizers.” In describing the activities of the Redlegs, Union General Blunt stated, “A reign of terror was inaugurated, and no man’s property was safe, nor was his life worth much if he opposed them in their schemes of plunder and robbery.” It is difficult to quantify the number of civilians killed by the Redlegs, but a letter written from the Lexington area early in the Redlegs campaign (April 1863) stated that the Redlegs had “killed at least fifty men, who were unarmed and heretofore lived in peace and quiet".|$|E

The success of that work was followed in 1920 by an enthusiastic reception for The Hymn of Jesus, described in The Observer as [...] "one of the most brilliant and one of the most sincere pieces of choral and orchestral expression heard for some years." [...] The Times called it [...] "undoubtedly the most strikingly original choral work which has been produced in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> many years." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Marshall visited Knoxville, Tennessee and {{met with}} Benton MacKaye, a {{regional}} planner who gained support to designate and lay out the Appalachian Trail. Together with Harvey Broome, a Knoxville lawyer, they discussed Marshall's 1930 proposal for an organization dedicated to wilderness preservation. Bernard Frank, a fellow forester, joined them later in the year; the men mailed an [...] "Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness" [...] to like-minded individuals. The invitation expressed their desire [...] "to integrate the growing sentiment which we believe exists in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> holding wild areas sound-proof as well as sight-proof from our increasingly mechanized life," [...] and their conviction that such wildernesses were [...] "a serious human need rather than a luxury and plaything".|$|E
500|$|.....addressed the Senate on 'the colossal {{innocence of}} the junior Senator from Wisconsin.' Comparing McCarthy to 'Dennis the Menace' of cartoon fame, the Vermonter {{delivered}} a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation. 'In every country in which communism has taken over,' he reminded the Senate, 'the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.' He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.' 'Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, he could not {{have done a better job}} for them.' 'This is a colossal innocence, indeed.'" ...|$|E

500|$|As a protege of Slessor, Hardman proclaimed: [...] "An {{air force}} without bombers isn't an air force". He {{maintained}} {{that the only way}} to attain [...] "true and enduring air superiority" [...] was by attacking the enemy's vital centres, which included its means of producing fighters. He recommended that the RAAF purchase one of Britain's nuclear-capable [...] "V bombers"—the Vickers Valiant, Handley Page Victor, or Avro Vulcan—though this never eventuated, and Australia's jet bomber remained the English Electric Canberra until the long-delayed introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C in 1973. Towards the end of his tenure as CAS, Hardman gave an interview in which he criticised Army and Navy operations against a backdrop of continuing interservice rivalry for the defence budget. He was quoted as saying: [...] "The Air Force in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>for</b> either defence or offence, is the only force worth while. It can be sent anywhere in the world to the point where it can do most good and be rapidly switched to any other point." [...] In contrast to the initial disquiet at his appointment, upon his departure from Australia Hardman was described by The Age as [...] "the outstanding CAS in the RAAF's history", a [...] "brilliant organiser", and a [...] "master of the theory of air power". He was succeeded by McCauley on 18January 1954.|$|E

2500|$|Trouble {{continued}} to follow Gorton to Providence, where his democratic ideas concerning {{church and state}} led to a division of sentiment in this town. [...] On 8 March 1640, Roger Williams wrote to Massachusetts magistrate John Winthrop, [...] "Master Gorton having abused high and low at Aquidneck, is now bewitching and bemadding poor Providence, both with his unclean and his foul censures of all the ministers of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> (<b>for</b> which myself in Christ's name have withstood him) and also denying all visible and external ordinances in depth of Familism." [...] Being a bitter partisan by nature, Gorton used his talent and energy to consolidate many discontented settlers into a destructive party in the otherwise peaceful settlement established by Williams.

2500|$|In the president's request, he had {{not asked}} for the {{combined}} numbers of U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft; he asked for the [...] "number of combat aircraft by types which should be produced in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> the Army and our Allies in 1943..." [...] This meant that the Navy's aircraft needs, which were significant, were not requested, but that the aircraft needs for America's allies would be included, allies that were to receive {{a certain amount of}} Navy-type aircraft. Hansell decided to make his plan wholly inclusive of all American aircraft requirements—Army, Navy, and Allied—so {{that there would be no}} misunderstanding about how aircraft-producing resources would be allocated. Hansell accepted the aircraft production plans that the Navy submitted, but with one vital change: the four-engined bombers the Navy wanted would be built as Air Corps bombers, flown by USAAF units.|$|E
