5000|$|Carrington's {{radio show}} on BBC Radio 2 {{entitled}} All Time Greats began on 4 October 1981. It was broadcast {{for two hours}} every Sunday from 1pm. Although initially pre-recorded and broadcast from a BBC studio, his first live broadcast {{from his home in}} Perthshire was on 31 August 1997, this was the day that Diana, Princess of Wales, died and Carrington agreed that it would be inappropriate to use the pre-recorded show on that day. In 2004 it was moved to an hourly slot on a Tuesday evening, and a few years later to a Friday night. The show was called 'The Music Goes Round' with a usual weekly theme of music, an occasional special 50s night and musical nights. He introduced every show with the greeting [...] "Evening all, from home in Perthshire" [...] and then always ended his show with [...] "Bye just now!" [...] and [...] "...of course, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> [...] "us" [...] emphasised at your place" [...] not forgetting a reference to his cat, [...] "Golden Paws" [...] Sam. Carrington used his personal collection of some 80,000 CDs, LPs and 78s. When he retired in 2016 the show was still attracting more than 800,000 listeners.|$|E

I wanted to be alone with you for a while today but it’s {{probably}} a good thing I wasn’t. {{there were a couple of}} things I was going to say—nothing important but it’s undoubtedly for the best that we weren’t alone today. What a bunch of moods we went through last night. Just about every one in the books—or don’t they have a book of moods? Gee, honey, you’re so wonderful and patient—I love you so. The more I think about March, the further it seems away. Gee, honey, will it ever get here. Everyone else says it will be here before I know it. I wish I could believe that. Time sure flies when I’m with you but golly, darling, when you’re not around, every minute drags. I love you so, honey. Judson, I know that I’ve never been in love with anyone before. There could never be anyone else for me either, darling. You’ve spoiled me for every other male. There isn’t a man living who could compare to you. I love you so, darling. I only wish that I could show you how much I love you. That’s one thing I’ll never be able to do. I love you so, my darling. Honestly, you’re so sweet and thoughtful. How can anyone be as wonderful as you. Judson, I do hate to be away from you even for a few minutes. These next two months will be murder, darling, I don’t know what I’ll ever do without you for two whole months. Darling, I’m in a rut. I can’t think of anything but you 2 ̆ 6 being near you. That’s the only thing I care to think about, too. Hon, this can’t go on much longer. Golly, I love you so. Weekends go so fast now. This one just flew so awfully fast. Darling, I meant to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> up to the Air Show. It was wonderful. Gee, those planes were beautiful. I can understand how you love them so much 2 ̆ 6 I wish I could fly with you. It was a wonderful show 2 ̆ 6 you’re wonderful, too. What a one track mind I have, darling. How do you like this short little letter, my darling? I just go on 2 ̆ 6 on writing to you. You’re so marvelous 2 ̆ 6 I love you. Honey, it just doesn’t seem possible. Really, I was so sure that I never could love you any more than I did before but—well, it’s the same old story. I love you so much more, my darling. It just doesn’t seem possible, honey, that I could love anyone this much. Well, my darling, please write often. I love you so. Oh, tell Steve I’ll try to write him tomorrow. I don’t have anything to tell him, though because I’m in such a fog that I wouldn’t hear anything anyone said to me. What did you do after you left us tonight. Golly, I hated to leave you today, honey. Well, hon, I’ve got to get to sleep. It’s about 7 : 30 and I’ll probably get there about none. I love you. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
