2500|$|The {{stage and}} set for Ovo were {{designed}} by Gringo Cardio and utilize irregular shapes throughout. [...] The rear wall is [...] wide by [...] high and is only supported at the sides, thus allowing the trampolines for the final act <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> During its arena tour, Ovo used the stage from the classic cirque show, Dralion. Inset in the wall are 24 [...] "firefly eggs"; these are moulded fibreglass bulbs fitted with LED bulbs which can produce a full color spectrum of light. [...] The [...] "membranes" [...] seen throughout the performance are quite large in scale, the largest being [...] wide by [...] high. [...] The egg seen {{at the beginning of}} the show is inflated to the size of [...] wide by [...] high.|$|E
5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> from place <b>to</b> place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> its <b>place</b> <b>to</b> further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|The patella {{generally}} dislocates laterally, and can {{be accompanied}} by acute pain and disability. Immediate reduction {{can be accomplished by}} hyperextension of the knee, and by providing a medialward pressure to move the patella back into the patellofemoral groove. Hyperextension of the knee on its own could possibly move the patella <b>into</b> <b>place,</b> because this motion locks the knee in place. When the knee is locked the ligaments are twisted and taut, allowing the muscles involved to relax and the patella <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> back <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> If that does not work, a medical professional must manually perform an orthopedic reduction. [...] Swelling and impaired mobility follow patellar dislocation, and a rehabilitation program of six to sixteen weeks is recommended whether or not the patient undergoes surgery.|$|R

With tailgate down, shuttle car <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> along sides {{and bottom of}} reservoir. Reservoir retracts along inside of car and out through tailgate, leaving coal behind in car. System not restricted to coal mining and may prove economical for hauling other solid materials...|$|R

5000|$|By 1993, issues {{back home}} over his {{courtship}} of and marriage to Barbara Feltus, whose mother was German and father was African-American, and tax {{problems with the}} German Government, had caused Becker <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> a severe mid-career decline.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Risingson" [...] on Massive Attack's Mezzanine album, the singer {{apparently}} appeals to his company {{to leave the}} club they're in, deriding the common persons' infatuation with them, and implying that he's about <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> antisocial behaviour: ...|$|R
50|$|Robert enters. The nuns hide, but {{return to}} prevent his escape. Robert stands terrified before a saint's tomb. The Abbess lures him towards the talisman in the saint's hand. Robert seizes it. The nuns {{continue}} their dance, fluttering like white moths. Their graves open and they {{sink into the}} earth. Stone slabs <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>place,</b> covering the dead. A choir of demons is heard.|$|R
6000|$|As I held up my gun {{and gazed}} at the abruptly-deserted main-deck I was aware of Wada's touch on my arm. I looked. In his hand were a dozen little [...] .22 long, soft-nosed, {{smokeless}} cartridges. He wanted me to reload. I threw on the safety, opened the magazine, and tilted the rifle {{so that he could}} let the fresh cartridges of themselves <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b>|$|R
30|$|Yet {{whatever}} {{the cost of}} such solutions, it will be small {{compared to that of}} failing to intervene at all, and allowing nations <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> a state of anarchy – a process of ‘undevelopment’ that leads to impoverishment and suffering for millions.|$|R
6000|$|... "The holy saints {{remember}} us this day!" [...] said McCann, {{missing a}} stroke to cross himself. [...] "Will ye pull, ye damned Dutchman? Or we'll {{be the first}} <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> hell. This is no kind of a place at all at all." ...|$|R

They are never fully visible, and the {{character}} {{on the other side}} of the door is indicated by one of several door designs that <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> Episode 3 briefly reveals that they too are rabbits. In season six/zero, it's revealed they used to not wear the doors all the time. They are the main antagonists of season 1 and six/zero.|$|R
25|$|John Wolffe {{assesses the}} Lectures as: an {{interesting}} {{treatment of the}} problem of anti-Catholicism from an observer whose partisan commitment did not cause him <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> mere polemic and who had the advantage of viewing the religious battlefield {{from both sides of the}} tortured no man's land of Littlemore.|$|R

50|$|According to Fitzgerald critic James West, The Beautiful and Damned is {{concerned}} with the question of 'vocation'—what does one do with oneself when one has nothing to do? Fitzgerald presents Gloria as a woman whose vocation is nothing more than to catch a husband.

50|$|Because {{baseball}} {{shoes are}} spiked on the bottom, sliding with the spikes up increases {{the probability of}} injury to the defensive player covering the base. Knowledge of this fact can often increase the defensive player's fear of the possible contact from an impending slide and thus increase his distraction while attempting to make a play. Ty Cobb developed nine different ways <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> a base.|$|R
50|$|These {{records are}} also {{noteworthy}} {{for the high}} quality recording techniques used at RioSom studios in Rio de Janeiro by engineer Norman Sternberg. In the beginning, Elenco was a small label, based in Rio de Janeiro.
