500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|You, Me, and Everyone We Know's music {{falls under}} the rock and pop genres. [...] The band's {{influences}} include Joe Cocker, Andrew W.K., and Schuylar Croom, lead vocalist of the band He Is Legend. They have also been compared to others such as The Format, fun. and Panic! at the Disco. [...] Of the band's lyrics and music, Liebsch has said, [...] "A lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> a mix of what sits {{in the back of}} your head", and, [...] "Most of the songs are more cautionary tales than anything else. In the end we're trying to write exciting music that's catchy and throws you for a loop at the same time." ...|$|E
5000|$|In El Salvador pasteles are a red tinted corn flour-based {{dish with}} a {{stuffing}} of either beef or chicken with chopped potatoes and carrots. <b>The</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> cooked separately {{so that the}} flavors mix. Once <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> cooked, it is put into the molded flour dough, which is made by adding the mixture of boiled water and achiote powder, thus giving the flour the red coloring. Once <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> flour turnover it is fried to a finish. It is usually served with curtido (a lightly fermented cabbage slaw.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E

50|$|The non-fried {{version is}} much more {{complicated}} and is called runbing (潤餅) in Mandarin (still po̍h-piáⁿ (薄餅) in Taiwanese Hokkien).There {{are two kinds of}} skins which roll the stuffing: one that is slowly heated until cooked is famous for being very thin; the other is baked. Furthermore, the way of cooking <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> very different as well. In northern Taiwan, <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> flavored, stir-fired, sometimes it goes with peanut powder, and the sauce is salty. In southern Taiwan, <b>the</b> popiah <b>stuffing</b> <b>is</b> water blanched without additional seasoning, and flavoured primarily with sugar and peanut powder. For people who live in southern Taiwan, the addition of sufficient sugar is key for popiah. Moreover, some people like to heat or steam the spring roll again after it is made.|$|R

But the songs are fast; {{we have a lot}} of fast burners on this album. And <b>the</b> double-bass <b>stuff</b> for <b>the</b> heavier songs is really challenging for me this time. The patterns are super-hard, some of them." ...|$|R
