5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on <b>the</b> <b>inclination</b> of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, <b>the</b> <b>inclination</b> of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

We investigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of protoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths.

5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. <b>The</b> <b>inclination</b> of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inclination</b> {{distribution}} of Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become broader {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from the scattering objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. In a model including Planet Nine, the scattering objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of the scattering objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a broader inclination distribution. This inclination distribution is broader than is observed, in contrast to a five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed inclination distribution.|$|E
