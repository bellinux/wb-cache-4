5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign. Will wrote that if [...] "labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products {{with as much}} energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, {{there would be no}} need for Congress <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> protectionism". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A." [...] by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents.|$|E
500|$|British singer, Rita Ora, plays Drake's distant love {{interest}} in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video {{in front of a}} gray backdrop, as he seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "artistically contradictory", however said that the scenes of Drake sitting [...] "alone in his bedroom as flashing images of busy streets and crowds of strangers float around him, pensive and rebellious", and called them [...] "controlled chaos", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that [...] "He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers", and that he stuck with [...] "one leading lady".|$|E

500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured {{to the top of a}} deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven. For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant." [...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him ...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world." ...|$|E

40|$|What do we {{mean when}} we talk about events?

Thinking the event means <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the unthinkable, the unforeseeable and ultimately the unknowable. It is about letting go of a concept – almost impossible to relinquish – that teaching and learning are transparent entities: understandable, limitable, predictable, something we can and do know <b>about.</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>about</b> the event <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what actually happens, not what we think should or ought to happen in our classrooms...|$|R

6000|$|I did therefore, {{during my}} stay in London, make an {{accurate}} {{study of the}} things that London seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> As a comparative basis for this study I brought with me a carefully selected list {{of the things that}} New York was thinking about at the moment.

Having thus a working idea of what I may call the mind of New York, I was able to collect and set beside it a list of similar topics, taken from the London Press to represent the mind of London.

60|$|Now, {{all this}} seemed unsubstantial, and I remembered these things dimly, {{like a dream}} or a story told to me in childhood; and sometimes, when recalling the past, I seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> ancient history--Sesostris, and the Babylonians and Assyrians, {{and that sort of}} thing. And, besides, it would be very hard to get back from a place where even the name of London was unknown.

Anyhow, a year could not make much difference, and I should also keep my money, which seemed an advantage, though it wasn't much.
