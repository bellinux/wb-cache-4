5|$|B-line. Founded by Bolzano, born 1915. Bolzano's {{less common}} line, {{although}} strong in Austria, is not prevalent elsewhere. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> spreading nevertheless; the U.S. and several European countries including Great Britain are establishing Bolzano lines.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail's {{plans for}} {{electrification}} of the Great Western Main Line include provision for flood defences where <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> in {{proximity to the}} Holy Brook.|$|E
5|$|SIR {{operates}} 24/7 with modified R44 New York City Subway cars, and {{is run by}} the New York City Transit Authority, {{an agency}} of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and operator of the New York City Subway. However, there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the subway system proper. SIR riders do get a free transfer to New York City Subway lines, and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> included on official New York City Subway maps. Commuters who use the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan; <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> accessible from within the Ferry Terminal and most of its trains connect with the ferry.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>were</b> closed around 1990. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} remaining east-west lines in Schleswig-Holstein. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> a possible detour route of military strategic importance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> quadrupled in 1903. In 1925 <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> electrified.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1891 in the Bosnian gauge of 760mm. From 1963 <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> realigned and rebuilt to Standard gauge. Parts of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>line</b> <b>were</b> flooded by <b>the</b> {{creation of the}} a number of Hydroelectric dams along the river. <b>The</b> standard gauge <b>line</b> <b>was</b> officially opened on 26 and 27 November 1966. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> electrified in 1969.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} a {{quotation}} by Robert Louis Stevenson—"The cruelest lies are often told in silence". <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> taken from Virginibus Puerisque, and Other Papers, an 1881 collection of essays.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> built, {{owned and}} {{maintained}} by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. At Sandvika, the line connects to the Drammen Line, which runs to Oslo Central Station in the east. At Asker, the line connects to the Spikkestad and Drammen Lines; the latter connects to the Sørland- and Vestfold Line at Drammen. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> served by Norwegian State Railways with regional trains to Vestfold, Buskerud and Telemark, and the express trains along the Sørland Line and the Bergen Line; in addition, the Airport Express Train operates from Asker to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. During night, freight trains also use the line.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not {{currently}} electrified, {{and there is}} local support for electrification {{as an extension of}} the Great Western Main Line upgrade programme. A community centre and café was opened at the station in 2011.|$|E
30|$|In this region, {{you have}} an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart next to an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together. When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together, <b>the</b> 3 D shape of the terrain is steep, and changes quickly (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES). When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart, <b>the</b> shape of the terrain is shallow, and changes slowly (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES).|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} lifted after closure, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{in need of}} {{a complete}} rebuild.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1897, and was {{initially}} operated as a water counterbalance funicular. In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> automated, {{still as a}} water counterbalance funicular. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and converted to electric operation, with new cabins and stations.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not electrified, but plans {{remain in}} place to address this {{as part of the}} planned {{modernisation}} of the Great Western Main Line. A new platform will also be built, allowing increased services from London.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{now called}} the St Helier Line, and forms part of the Sutton Loop, served by trains from Thameslink and Southern.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{is part of}} the LGV Est {{high-speed}} rail line, which will connect Paris with Strasbourg. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> also a part of the Main line for Europe trans-European {{high-speed rail}} line from Paris to Bratislava, Slovakia.|$|E
30|$|In this region, {{you have}} an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart next to an area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together. When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> closer together, <b>the</b> {{elevation}} is changing quickly, meaning the region has a steep slope (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES). When <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>are</b> farther apart, <b>the</b> elevation is changing slowly, meaning the region has a shallow slope (TRACE PERPENDICULAR ACROSS THE LINES).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{lifted in}} <b>the</b> later 1960s after <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> used for <b>the</b> {{construction}} of the new Harecastle Tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> used as <b>the</b> diversion route from the Mainline at Longport to <b>the</b> loop <b>line</b> and back on the mainline north of Kidsgrove.|$|R
50|$|The {{junction}} {{closed in}} 1986 as <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{not being used}} any more even for freight. In 1988, the tracks were disconnected {{at both ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> tracks remained, overgrown, for over 18 years until 2007 when <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> dismantled and <b>the</b> area where <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> was concreted over.|$|R
5|$|With extra {{interest}} payments factored in, {{the cost of}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> expected to exceed £1 billion.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if the far end of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> opened between Caboolture and Woodford in 1909. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} to Kilcoy in 1913. [...] <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{closed to}} all traffic by British Railways on 5 January 1969. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to competition from trams, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> electrified in 1916 using a unique 1,200 volt side-contact third rail system, which remained in operation until <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> converted to Metrolink operation in 1991. From 1959 until 1991, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> operated by [...] EMUs.|$|R
5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: <b>The</b> <b>Line</b> <b>is</b> too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations. The station {{was designed to be}} serviced with side platforms as it mainly serves the surrounding neighbourhood. As it is the only station in the system that is not connected to a regular bus or streetcar route {{it is one of the}} least used subway stations in Toronto. The 300 Bloor-Danforth Night Bus operates on Danforth from 1:30-5:30 a.m. after <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> shut down for nightly maintenance.|$|E
5|$|East (railroad south) of the station, {{the line}} curves south onto Jay Street and has three track {{switches}} with the IND Sixth Avenue Line. A power station for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> {{located on the}} west side of Jay Street just north of Concord Street. A second substation is located at Red Cross Place and Cadman Plaza East.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> only {{operated}} {{for four}} years. In June 1918, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> damaged by flooding and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> abandoned on December 31, 1920.|$|R
25|$|Once shuttle {{services}} on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>were</b> introduced, operation of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> simplified {{to cut down}} on the staff required.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> {{worked on}} <b>the</b> one engine in steam principle, {{and the speed}} limit {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> 15 mph.|$|R
5|$|From Kings Cross, {{the line}} {{proceeds}} west towards the Sydney Central Business District on a viaduct that passes over the suburb of Woolloomooloo and the Eastern Distributor. The line then passes into a tunnel underneath the Art Gallery of New South Wales to a station underneath Martin Place. Turning south, the line proceeds through Town Hall, Central and Redfern stations, before emerging behind the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> double track throughout, with turnback sidings at Martin Place and Bondi Junction for citybound trains, and at Central for trains from Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level {{crossing}} and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|N-line. Founded by Nibbio, born 1920. Early in its history, the Nibbio line {{split into}} two branches, one in Italy and one in Austria. The N-line is populous, with the {{greatest}} number of stallions at stud. It is one of two (the other being the A-line) with a presence in all Haflinger breeding countries. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> most prolific in Austria and Italy.|$|E
50|$|As built <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> single track, {{excluding}} at {{the junction}} at the Horbury end, and was 8 mi in length; <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> declared fit for use on 26 December 1849, and was handed to the L&YR on 31 December 1849. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> doubled by 1855.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Hitler <b>Line</b> <b>was</b> a German {{defensive}} line in central Italy during the Second World War. The strong points of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>were</b> at Aquino and Piedimonte. In May 1944, <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>the</b> Senger <b>Line,</b> after General von Senger und Etterlin, {{one of the}} generals commanding Axis forces in the area. This was done at Hitler's insistence, in order to minimise any propaganda significance should <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>be</b> penetrated.|$|R
50|$|Freight traffic did {{not meet}} {{expectations}} and <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> reduced to single track after 1923. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1964.|$|R
