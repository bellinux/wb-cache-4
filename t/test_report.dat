25|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on New Year's Eve between 3,000 and 5,000 red-winged {{blackbirds}} {{fell from the}} sky in Beebe. Most were dead on the ground but some were living but dazed. Laboratory tests have been performed and the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission, the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin as well as the University of Georgia's wildlife disease study group have procured specimens of the dead birds. In addition to the blackbirds a few grackles and starlings also {{fell from the sky}} in the same incident.

40|$|Crowdsourcing is an {{appealing}} and economic solution to software application testing {{because of its}} ability to reach a large international audience. Meanwhile, crowdsourced testing could have brought a lot of bug reports. Thus, in crowdsourced software testing, the inspection {{of a large number of}} <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is an enormous but essential software maintenance task. Therefore, automatic prediction of the severity of crowdsourced <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is important because of their high numbers and large proportion of noise. Most existing approaches to this problem utilize supervised machine learning techniques, which often require users to manually label a large number of training data. However, Android <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> are not labeled with their severity level, and manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the above problems, we propose a Knowledge Transfer Classification (KTC) approach based on text mining and machine learning methods to predict the severity of <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> Our approach obtains training data from bug repositories and uses knowledge transfer to predict the severity of Android <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> In addition, our approach uses an Importance Degree Reduction (IDR) strategy based on rough set to extract characteristic keywords to obtain more accurate reduction results. The results of several experiments indicate that our approach is beneficial for predicting the severity of android <b>test</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R
25|$|Later {{investigations}} discovered problems {{concerning the}} state of Sewol {{at the time of}} departure. The Safety Investigation Report made by the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal noted that Sewol at the time of departure was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo when its maximum allowance was 987 tons. TIME magazine further noted that the cargo had been improperly secured. The Report also noted that only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, that some ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and that the last voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. Kukmin Ilbo reported that Captain Shin, the regular captain of Sewol, had warned the company about the decrease in stability and passenger satisfaction and attributed it to the removal of the side ramp. However, Captain Shin claimed that the company responded with threats to fire him if he continued his objections. Captain Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from the company responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. The Korea Herald also reported that the captain had requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, which was not done. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Korean Register of Shipping had noted in a stability <b>test</b> <b>report</b> dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'top heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' The New York Times reported that the company budget for the safety training of the crew was $2 USD, which was used to buy a paper certificate.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet units {{received}} 247 P-40B/Cs (equivalent to the Tomahawk IIA/B in RAF service) and 2,178 P-40E, -K, -L, and -N models between 1941 and 1944.

In late September 1941, the first 48 P-40s were assembled and checked in USSR. Test flights showed some manufacturing defects: generator and oil pump gears and generator shafts failed repeatedly, which led to emergency landings. The <b>test</b> <b>report</b> indicated that the Tomahawk was inferior to Soviet [...] "M-105P-powered production fighters in speed and rate of climb. However, it had good short field performance, horizontal manoeuvrability, range and endurance." [...] Nevertheless, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks were used against the Germans. The 126th IAP fighting on the Western and Kalinin fronts were the first unit to receive the P-40. The regiment entered action on 12 October 1941. By 15 November 1941, that unit had shot down 17 German aircraft. However, Lt (SG) Smirnov noted that the P-40 armament was sufficient for strafing enemy lines but rather ineffective in aerial combat.
