The control groups consisted of 21 histologically negative <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> and fifteen cases of vascular margins of nephrectomies. For detection of the presence of HPV, two methods were used: 1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra, 2) Cervista™ HPV HR. All cases were from the files of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis. Results HPV DNA was detected by PCR and genotyping in 16 of 22 (73 %) histologically positive cases of GCA and in only five of 21 (24 %) histologically negative <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Among the vascular margin controls, only three of 15 (20 %) were positive for HPV DNA. The second, independent method (Cervista TM) confirmed the aforesaid results with 100 % concordance with the exception of three cases which had low genomic DNA for which {{it was not possible to}} perform the test.

40|$|Objective: It is {{controversial}} whether microorganisms {{play a role}} in the pathogenesis of large and medium vessel vasculitides (eg, giant cell arteritis [GCA], Takayasu arteritis [TAK] and focal idiopathic aortitis [FIA]). Recent studies have reported the presence of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) within formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> and aortas of about three-quarters or more of patients with these conditions, and in a minority of controls. In a prospective study, we sought to confirm these findings using DNA extracted from vessels that were harvested under surgically aseptic conditions and snap frozen. Methods and Results: DNA samples extracted from 11 surgically sterile <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> and 31 surgically sterile thoracic aortas were used in an attempt to identify the vessel-associated VZV genome. Two different validated PCR methods were used. Thirty-one thoracic aorta aneurysm specimens included biopsies from 8 patients with GCA, 2 from patients with TAK, 6 from patients with FIA, and 15 from patients without vasculitis, who had non-inflammatory aneurysms. Eleven <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> were collected from 5 patients with GCA and 6 controls.

40|$|Objective. Patients with giant-cell {{arteritis}} (GCA) usually respond dramatically to corticosteroid treatment. However, recurrences {{are frequent}} and corticosteroid requirements are highly variable among patients. The aim {{of our study}} was to identify genes potentially involved in disease persistence. Methods. Gene expression was explored with cDNA arrays in <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> from six GCA patients with relapsing disease and six patients who easily achieved sustained remission. Differentially expressed genes of interest were subsequently analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry in <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> from 35 patients with biopsy-proven GCA and nine controls. Results. CCL 2 (MCP- 1) was up-regulated in <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> samples from relapsing individuals. In the extended series of patients, CCL 2 mRNA concentration in lesions was significantly higher than in controls (31 15. 6 vs 0. 44 0. 10, P 0. 0001). In addition, CCL 2 was more abundant in patients who experienced two or more relapses during the first year compared with those who endured sustained remission (127 82 vs 11 5. 5, P 0. 0233) and correlated with the cumulated prednisolone dose (R 0. 533, P 0. 0024). CCL 2 mRNA concentration correlated with IL- 1 (R 0. 45, P 0. 02), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) (R 0. 47, P 0. 013) and IL- 6 (R 0. 52, P 0. 0053) mRNA. However, circulating CCL 2 determined by ELISA was decreased in patients with strong systemic inflammatory response, suggesting that reduction in circulating CCL 2 may reinforce the local gradient in lesions.

40|$|Background—In giant cell {{arteritis}} (GCA), vasculitic {{damage of}} the aorta and its branches {{is combined with}} a syndrome of intense systemic inflammation. Therapeutically, glucocorticoids remain the gold standard because they promptly and effectively suppress acute manifestations; however, they fail to eradicate vessel wall infiltrates. The effects of glucocorticoids on the systemic and vascular components of GCA are not understood. Methods and Results—The immunoprofile of untreated and glucocorticoid-treated GCA was examined in peripheral blood and <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> with protein quantification assays, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. Plasma interferon- and interleukin (IL) - 17 and frequencies of interferon-– producing and IL- 17 –producing T cells were markedly elevated before therapy. Glucocorticoid treatment suppressed the Th 17 but not the Th 1 arm in the blood and the vascular lesions. Analysis of monocytes/macrophages in the circulation and in <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> revealed glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of Th 17 -promoting cytokines (IL- 1, IL- 6, and IL- 23) but sparing of Th 1 -promoting cytokines (IL- 12). In human artery–severe combined immunodeficiency mouse chimeras, in which patient-derived T cells cause inflammation of engrafted human <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries,</b> glucocorticoids were similarly selective in inhibiting Th 17 cells and leaving Th 1 cells unaffected.

40|$|The peptidergic sensory {{innervation}} of cranial {{blood vessels}} may {{play an important}} part in vascular head pain. The neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P in sensory fibres are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by the blood vessels, and when released from nerve terminals mediate neurogenic inflammation. NGF is increased in inflamed tissues, and acts via its high affinity receptor trk A on nociceptor fibres to produce hyperalgesia. CGRP and trk A immunoreactive nerve fibres have therefore been studied, for the first time, in inflamed (n= 7) and non-inflamed (n= 10) <b>temporal</b> <b>arteries</b> <b>biopsied</b> from patients with headache and suspected giant cell arteritis. CGRP immunoreactivity was markedly decreased to absent in adventitial nerve fibres in inflamed regions of vessels, which may reflect secretion from nerve terminals, as CGRP immunoreactivity could still be seen in nerve trunks in periadventitial tissue. Trk A immunoreactive nerve fibres were found in a similar distribution to CGRP containing nerve fibres in non-inflamed vessels, and the trk A immunoreactivity was virtually unchanged in inflamed vessels. The evidence supports a role for NGF related mechanisms in inflammatory vascular head pain. Anti-NGF or anti-trk A agents may represent novel analgesics in this condition. ...|$|R

Isolated orbital amyloidosis is a rare condition and requires systemic examination. The authors report a case of amyloid deposit in the orbit whose systemic investigation has been negative. METHODS: A 64 -year-old woman presented to the eye clinic with left-sided orbital mass, mild exophthalmos with downward ocular displacement, and ptosis. The patient presented also visual acuity loss and ocular hypertension. No systemic involvement was noted by systemic workup and it confirmed the primary orbital amyloidosis. RESULTS: The patient was subject to full clinical examination, laboratory examinations, orbital echography, magnetic resonance imaging and total body computed tomography scans, rectal mucosa, and <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies.</b> It was necessary to exclude systemic amyloidosis.

This {{study investigated the}} hypothesis that high-resolution MR imaging of the superficial cranial arteries is a noninvasive imaging technique that can detect the occurrence of giant cell arteritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast-enhanced, high-resolution MR imaging was performed on 64 consecutive patients with suspected giant cell arteritis. Mural thickness, lumen diameter, and a mural contrast enhancement score were assessed with T 1 -weighted spin-echo images with submillimeter in-plane spatial resolution. The final rheumatologist’s diagnosis according to the clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology including laboratory tests and results of <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> from 32 patients {{was used as a}} “gold standard ” for the evaluation of the MR imaging findings.

40|$|Monocytes/macrophages are {{critical}} in systemic and local inflammation in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and possibly in clinically overlapping polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Therefore, we aimed {{to understand the}} contribution of monocyte subsets and the CX 3 CR 1 -CX 3 CL 1 and CCR 2 -CCL 2 migratory pathways, to the pathology of GCA. Peripheral blood monocytes were enumerated in samples from newly-diagnosed, untreated GCA and PMR patients and after prednisone-induced remission. The distribution of classical (CD 14 (bright) CD 16 (neg)) and the more pro-inflammatory, intermediate (CD 14 (bright) CD 16 +) and non-classical (CD 14 (dim) CD 16 +) monocyte subsets was analysed by flow cytometry. The phenotype of macrophages in <b>temporal</b> <b>artery</b> <b>biopsies</b> (TABs) from GCA patients was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. A clear monocytosis was seen in newly diagnosed GCA and PMR patients caused by elevated numbers of classical monocytes. Prednisone treatment suppressed numbers of non-classical monocytes. Both chemokine CX 3 CL 1 and CCL 2 were highly expressed in the TAB. Most macrophages in the TAB of GCA patients expressed non-classical monocyte markers CD 16 and CX 3 CR 1 whereas co-localisation of CD 16 with classical monocyte marker CCR 2 was infrequent. In conclusion, we report an altered distribution of monocyte subsets in both GCA and PMR patients. The majority of macrophages in TABs of GCA patients were CD 68 + CD 16 + CX 3 CR 1 + CCR 2 - and thereby resembled the phenotype of non-classical monocytes...|$|R
