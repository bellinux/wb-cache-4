40|$|AbstractSea freight {{transportation}} plays {{a vital role}} in the global supply chain. Sri Lanka is located closer to one of the world busiest sea routes: east to west. Since Sri Lanka is located in the Southern tip of the Indian sub-continent, its sea ports could play a pivotal role in transhipment activities of the South Asian region. Presently, Sri Lanka is developing its two of the main sea ports to cater the regional demands. However, still it has not concerned to enhance the productivity of the <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations</b> in detail. This study aims to enhance the transhipment productivity by considering different options using modelling and simulation techniques. The main strategies tested in this study are LEAN and Green concepts towards overall operations. Commercially available simulation package, Flexsim is used for modelling and simulating port operations. The results reveal that incorporating LEAN and green concepts along with multi model transportation strategies between main ports will enhance the overall productivity of the <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{problem of}} {{analysing}} operational policies for transhipping containers in a port container terminal is studied using an agent-based simulation approach. The decision makers involved in <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations,</b> i. e., the terminal manager, the port captain, the stevedores {{and the ship}} captains, {{as well as some}} of the operators of the physical resources, such as cranes and straddle carriers, are modelled as agents. A simulator, called SimPort, has been developed to illustrate the viability of this approach, To exemplify its usage, it has been configured based on real data from container terminals and used for comparing eight operational policies in several scenarios. The policies concern the sequencing of ships, berth allocation, and stacking rule. The policies are evaluated with respect to a number of aspects, such as, turn-around time for ships and travelled distance of straddle carriers...|$|E

This project encompasses the usage of a combination of an overland conveyor system, modern barges and barging technologies as well as a transhipper. Located approximately 50 kilometres south-east of Rockhampton and approximately 40 kilometres north-west of Gladstone in Central Queensland my thesis project is set to deliver a low impact and inventive coal export solution(IAS, June 2011). The project is set to have an overall export of 18 million tonnes of coal per annum and will include construction of a rail unloading facility, stockyard, barge loading terminal and offshore marine <b>transhipment</b> <b>operation.</b> The project will incorporate barging technology rather than more traditional port facilities and transport coal along Raglan Creek near Port Alma and then transfer the coal into ships in the open waters. The purpose of this project is to analyse and design the bulk material handling operational specifications of the export facility such as the;  Stockyard Size and layout  Conveyor belt widths and optimal speed  Barge loading facility  Transhipper loading and discharge specifications These bulk material handling design specifications have been determined through a number of spread sheets and calculations as defined throughout the report below...|$|R

30|$|The {{predominance}} of maritime transport {{has increased in}} particular for manufactured goods due to the intensification of containerized transport services. Thanks to containerization and the global liner shipping network, small and large exporters and importers of finished and intermediate containerizable goods from far away countries can trade with each-other, even if their individual trade transaction would not economically justify chartering a ship. Thanks to a network of regular container shipping services with <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations</b> in so-called hub ports, basically all countries are today connected to each other. A recent empirical study confirmed the “[e]ffects of the Container Revolution on World Trade” (Bernhofen et al. 2013). As far as North-North trade is concerned the authors found a cumulative (concurrent plus lag effects) average treatment effect of containerization over a 20  year time period amount to 790 %. The cumulative effect of bilateral GATT membership is found to raise trade {{by an average of}} 285 %, which is less than half the cumulative effect of full containerization.|$|E

40|$|Intermodal road‐rail {{transport}} has {{a medium}} to high market share for large flows over long distances and for seaport hinterland flows, and competes on cost in these markets with road transport. Due {{to the small}} size of this market segment compared to the total transport market the modal shift potential is marginal at best. It is therefore increasingly recognized that the conventional approach to intermodal transport focusing on large flows over long distances may be insufficient to address the persistent problem of a growing modal share of road freight. As a complement to the conventional approach, alternative network operations are needed that allow an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage. This innovative approach requires fast and efficient <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations,</b> which cannot be achieved by the present conventional terminals since they absorb too much time and money. Hence, technological innovations in the transhipment process will have a major role to play for achieving a modal shift. The raiload technology enables automatic transhipments of standardised loading units below catenaries and thereby makes fast and efficient <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations</b> possible, both for railrail as well as for rail‐road exchange. By that, the technology facilitates the implementation of innovative rail networks. The aim of this research is to analyse how this technological innovation can be integrated in a context of innovative intermodal transport services. The results indicate that fast and efficient transhipment technologies are a prerequisite for intermodal linertrains which can integrate short and medium distance transports in the intermodal system. Linertrains can open business opportunities for operators and cost savings for shippers in a market segment which is dominated by road transport. Furthermore, linertrains can further contribute to reaching policy goals, e. g., lower externalities from freight transport and regional development of far‐off regions. Yet, it is still too early to expect a breakthrough of linertrains. The implementation requires a system innovation but current politics and dominant actors still limit their actions to incremental improvements within the current rail production paradigm and dominant technology based on economies of scale and oppose organisational innovations. However, the fact that the implementation of intermodal linertrains seems to be unrealistic today should not discourage policy makers and stakeholders. System innovations are long‐termprocesses and there are indications that the transition process has started. Continuously increasing freight transport volumes and a significantly increased awareness for sustainable development put the dominating road freight transport paradigm under pressure. As a response, transport politics, transport buyers, and transport operators show an increased interest in intermodal transport. Hence, the current barriers should be seen as challenges to overcome rather than as impediments to progress. To manage the transition towards innovative intermodal transport services and to overcome current barriers, {{there is a need for}} connecting the existing dynamics by applying the technological innovation in the existing large‐scale production system. These niche‐applications do not require major changes of transport and logistics structures and can provide room for technological learning and development which is needed to reduce economic uncertainties and risks involved in technological innovations. A promising approach is a new‐generation large scale hub terminal for seaport hinterland flows, since the raiload technology can contribute to solving existing efficiency and capacity problems in this segment of the transport market...|$|E
40|$|Floating Bulk <b>Transhipment</b> <b>Operation</b> (FBTO), as a link in {{the whole}} bulk {{logistic}} chain, used to be performed only in well-sheltered water. Current operability assessment of FBTO is mainly based on experience and rules of thumbs, only taking into account environmental conditions such as significant wave height and wind speed. Corresponding to rocketing development of FBTO in more challenging environment, it {{becomes more and more}} important to develop a dedicated and reliable methodology which can assess the operability of FBTO properly. Matching the features of FBTO, long duration and multiple operational phases, persistency analysis is introduced in the operability study. However, persistency analysis has still not been thoroughly studied and well-supported by literature. Moreover, among all existing operability techniques, persistency analysis as one of them has its capability and limitation. To be better adapted to FBTO and to further extend the methodology for other offshore operations, it is thus beneficial to decompose the operability assessment procedure and then categorize the available techniques, as well as to understand conditions of each. This thesis report starts with a benchmark study of worldwide FBTO project. Among various FBTO configurations, the most representative scenario is chosen, which consists of 1 capesize vessel, 1 floating crane and 1 feeder vessel. Operation procedure and criteria are described based on interviewing different floating bulk transhipment operator companies. After that, this thesis proposes an operability assessment methodology for FBTO and has the versatility in assessing any other offshore operation, if the three components of this methodology, operability assessment table, mechanism and switches, are used properly. The methodology concludes with an operability assessment scheme, in which useful operability study techniques, such as persistency analysis, scatter analysis, frequency-domain analysis etc., are categorized. Then, an in-depth study about persistency analysis is performed. Persistency analysis approaches more reality than scatter analysis because it accounts duration and chronological sequence of the operation, as well as change in weather conditions. Finer persistency data quality and proper selection of sampling interval will both lead to more accurate operability assessment. Last but not least, the case study illustrates how the proposed methodology works. The first case compares persistency analysis to scatter analysis, while the second one studies the influence due to persistency data of different resolution on operability assessment. The last case demonstrates using this methodology to predict expected duration of FBTO including possible suspension.

40|$|The main {{contributions}} of this dissertation are the design, development {{and application of}} optimisation methodology, models and algorithms for large-scale problems arising in Operations Management. The first chapter introduces constraint transformations and valid inequalities that enhance the performance of column generation and Lagrange relaxation. I establish theoretical connections with dual-space reduction techniques and develop a novel algorithm that combines Lagrange relaxation and column generation. This algorithm is embedded in a branch-and-price scheme, which combines large neighbourhood and local search to generate upper bounds. Computational experiments on capacitated lot sizing show significant improvements over existing methodologies. The second chapter introduces a Horizon-Decomposition approach that partitions the problem horizon in contiguous intervals. In this way, subproblems {{identical to the original}} problem but of smaller size are created. The size of the master problem and the subproblems are regulated via two scalar parameters, giving rise to a family of reformulations. I investigate the efficiency of alternative parameter configurations empirically. Computational experiments on capacitated lot sizing demonstrate superior performance against commercial solvers. Finally, extensions to generic mathematical programs are presented. The final chapter shows how large-scale optimisation methods can be applied to complex operational problems, and presents a modelling framework for scheduling the <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations</b> of the Noble Group, a global supply chain manager of energy products. I focus on coal operations, where coal is transported from mines to vessels using barges and floating cranes. Noble pay millions of dollars in penalties for delays, and for additional resources hired to minimize the impact of delays. A combination of column generation and dedicated heuristics reduces the cost of penalties and additional resources, and improves the efficiency of the operations. Noble currently use the developed framework, and report significant savings attributed to it...|$|E
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ISE 2015 WangZxx, 189 pages :color illustrationsTerminal {{operations}} {{are known to}} be among the most challenging operational research topics because the field is full of theories with applications to real-life practice. In the last decade, terminal operations research has been carried out on such topics as berth allocation, quay crane scheduling, yard planning, container locating and internal tractors assignment and scheduling (ITAS). The latter is a particularly important topic since it directly affects the overall performance of container terminals, involving terminal productivity, equipment utilization and service rate, as well as associated seaside operations with yard-side operations. It involves the scheduling of internal tractors to transport different loading and unloading containers between vessels at the quayside and the yard side. The idea of ITAS is to improve the internal traffic flow in the container terminal. It mainly deals with the problem of assigning different internal tractors to pick-and-drop different exporting containers from the yard side to the quayside, and importing containers from the quayside to the yard side. However, many container terminal companies are still not able to efficiently and effectively cope with ITAS in the terminal logistic. There are a few challenging problems with respect to planning and managing a container transportation network that trouble terminal operators in terminal industry. In fact, the experience of an operator plays a crucial role in making the decision for exact number of internal tractors and transportation routes in daily operations. This is due to that the number of containers and storage locations are so large that the job of assigning and scheduling internal tractors to maximize terminal efficiency and enhance service level is extremely complicated. Moreover, allocating suitable storage locations for inbound containers requires a jointly consideration of managing internal tractors. It is difficult to decide which storage locations should be reserved for a certain vessel and where an inbound container should be stored, and this situation becomes even more complicated when transhipment is required. Although ITAS has been thoroughly researched, most of the studies lack consideration of practical issues, such as terminals outsourcing a number of internal tractors to perform a set of container delivery requests, and the transportation of transhipment containers. Due to a highly competitive business environment, container terminals are facing a tradeoff between container transportation efficiency and cost. Terminals strive to increase the efficiency of container delivery, which may need good transportation schedules and internal tractor deployment strategies. The scheduling and assignment of internal tractors is critical for maintaining high terminal performance in the overall container terminal system. In this connection, this study considers ITAS integration with the internal tractor deployment strategy and <b>transhipment</b> <b>operations,</b> and new models are developed. The ultimate goal is to maximize the terminal operation efficiency. Heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve these integrated and complicated models. Computational results show that solving the integration problem as a whole can significantly improve the terminal operation efficiency. This research is not only pioneering in the area of container terminal operations, but the findings also provide a vital reference for future research on ITAS. The study has generated the following five deliverables: (i) ITAS is enriched by formulating and modeling all potential available storage locations; (ii) a novel ITAS system integrating container storage allocation and yard truck deployment strategy is identified and modeled; (iii) a two-level heuristic optimization methodology is developed to deal with the novel ITAS system, which is shown to obtain better results compared with other algorithms; (iv) a new ITAS system for transhipment container delivery and transportation in transhipment hubs is detailed demonstrated and modeled; and (v) a decomposition iterative algorithm optimization methodology for the proposed ITAS system in transhipment hubs is proposed.
