5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him <b>the</b> <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E

5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context.

Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and {{paved the way for the}} 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air are {{a set of}} {{commercial}} aviation rights granting a country's airlines the privilege to enter and land in another country's airspace, formulated as a result <b>of</b> disagreements over <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> aviation liberalisation in the Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944, known as the Chicago Convention. The United States had called for a standardized set of separate air rights to be negotiated between states, but most other countries were concerned that <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. airlines would dominate air travel if there were not strict rules. <b>The</b> <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air are the fundamental building blocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international commercial aviation route network. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms [...] "freedom" [...] and [...] "right" [...] confer entitlement to operate international air services only within <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multilateral and bilateral treaties (air services agreements) that allow them.|$|R
