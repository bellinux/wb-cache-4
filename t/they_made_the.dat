5|$|Their most {{successful}} moment came in 1998, when, {{against all the}} odds they defeated Wigan in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> playoffs finishing in fifth place. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put {{in a bid to}} be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered {{a long period of}} decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> playoffs only twice. They did not appear in the Finals in this time and only won one of the three series they appeared in, beating the Atlanta Flames two games to none in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Boston manager Art Ross {{predicted}} that Thompson, now 35, would {{play for the}} Red Wings {{for at least another}} five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record in both of these seasons, although <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32–41–12 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5–6, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–74 season, {{the team}} was {{hampered}} {{by the loss of}} West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out. Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge. Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.|$|E

5|$|Route 112 {{was first}} {{assigned}} in the 1928 state numbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The route, when originally assigned, did start in Markham, but at an intersection with U.S. Route 1. The route's northern terminus {{remained the same}} in the route's entire lifetime. In 1941, the southern terminus was adjusted from the intersection with U.S. Route 1 (the Baltimore Pike) to an intersection with U.S. Route 322 near Markham. Although <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> adjustment, PA 112 ended up becoming one of the many routes decommissioned in 1946, when the commonwealth of Pennsylvania removed several hundred miles from their system. The designation has not been re-used since the 1946 removal.|$|E

5|$|The French {{defeat at}} Sedan left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at Sedan, was {{so fast that}} there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such shock that they were taken prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. By eliminating the bunkers in the Bellevue sector, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{have enjoyed}} a {{consistent}} fanbase throughout their history. The Toronto Raptors set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, 2002 seasons when <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season {{to an average}} of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2% of capacity at the ACC. Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season. Their television ratings, however, are considerably lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and most other sporting events shown on Canadian television.|$|E
5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who {{had played}} a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême. Charles VII returned, and this time {{destroyed}} the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two towers in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> castle among the best defended in France.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{also thought}} it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the film}} was made in {{opposition}} to classical style, it was embraced by those within the Hollywood industry, and ultimately helped Florey, Vorkapić, and Toland get more prestigious assignments within the film industry. Vorapich was offered a special effects position at Paramount Pictures shortly after A Hollywood Extra was released. Paramount wanted to hire Florey for the position, but after Josef von Sternberg clarified that Vorkapić was most responsible for A Hollywood Extras special effects, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> offer to him. Film production designer William Cameron Menzies was anxious to work with Florey after watching A Hollywood Extra, so the two co-authored The Love of Zero, with Florey directing and Menzies designing the sets.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Sudbury High School, Armstrong {{played on}} the hockey team with Red McCarthy and Tim Horton. Inspired by a newspaper advertisement offering tryouts with the Copper Cliff Redmen of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association (NOJHA), Armstrong convinced Horton and McCarthy {{to join him in}} trying out. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> team and Armstrong began his junior hockey career at age 16 in the 1946–47 season. He recorded six goals and five assists in nine games and caught the attention of scouts for the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Toronto Maple Leafs who added him to their protected list. He also played with the Prince Albert Blackhawks for part of that season. Armstrong quit school in grade 11 to focus on his hockey career.|$|E

5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E
5|$|York only secured {{survival}} from relegation {{late into}} 2012–13, their first season {{back in the}} Football League. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> League Two play-offs the following season, and were beaten 1–0 on aggregate by Fleetwood Town in the semi-final. However, York were relegated to the National League four years after returning to the Football League, with a bottom-place finish in League Two in 2015–16. York were further relegated to the National League North {{for the first time}} in 2016–17; however, they ended the season with a 3–2 win over Macclesfield Town at Wembley Stadium in the 2017 FA Trophy Final.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Morris {{announced}} his departure from the team, Martin announced that David Nedohin, the fourth player on his former provincial rival Randy Ferbey's team, would join Martin's team. Martin and team won their first event of the season at the Shoot-Out. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> semifinals in their next event at the Point Optical Curling Classic, but Martin injured his back during the semifinal game. Jeff Sharp subbed in at lead, and Martin's team finished the event as runners-up to Jeff Stoughton.
