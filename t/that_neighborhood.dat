5|$|Both Smith and {{his wife}} were of mixed-race African and European ancestry. As he became {{economically}} successful, he built a house in a good neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified in <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood</b> as white, whereas in 1850 they were classified as mulatto. He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but, after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 blacks were killed, Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white.|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood</b> concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E

40|$|Recognition {{is growing}} <b>that</b> {{criminogenic}} <b>neighborhood</b> effects may not {{end at the}} borders of local communities, <b>that</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> are located relative {{to one another in}} ways that shape local crime rates. Inspired by this insight, this research explores the changing spatial distribution of race and income around a location and determines how such changes are associated with crime patterns and trends in neighborhoods in Los Angeles. We examine how changes from 2000 to 2010 in the income composition, racial composition, and intersection of these two constructs are linked with changes in levels of crime across local areas. We find <b>that</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> experiencing greater increases in spatial inequality in a broader area (two and a half miles around the neighborhood) experience greater increases in crime levels in the focal area over the decade, and that this pattern is strongest for neighborhoods simultaneously experiencing increasing average household income or increasing inequality. We also find <b>that</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> simultaneously experiencing increases in inequality and racial-ethnic heterogeneity experience increases in crime...|$|R

25|$|The {{extension}} from New Rochelle to Port Chester {{was built}} to a much more economical standard, as exemplified by wooden platforms and more modest stations. The line was completed as far as Larchmont in 1921, Mamaroneck in 1926, Harrison in 1927, Rye in 1928, and Port Chester in December 1929. An additional station was constructed in White Plains at Ridgeway in 1929 to serve the growing residential area in <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Consisting of two side platforms, the wooden construction mimicked the Port Chester extension.|$|E
25|$|After midcentury, {{another group}} of {{migrants}} arrived in the neighborhood. Most African Americans {{who had come to}} Albany in the Great Migration of the 1920s had settled in Arbor Hill, where the quality houses of the Ten Broeck Triangle that had once been home to the city's wealthy were becoming cheaper as the wealthy moved west or to the suburbs. Thus affected and repopulated, <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood</b> began to suffer from neglect and declined. The city's response was small-scale urban renewal, and black residents displaced by the demolitions that required moved to the South End.|$|E

500|$|Friends {{had long}} urged Dunne {{to collect the}} Dooley pieces in book form, but he was reluctant, {{considering}} them lightweight. With the barkeeper now nationally known, Dunne finally agreed, and Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War appeared in November 1898. The book's preface was signed [...] "F.P.D." [...] {{the only time he}} would make even a slight acknowledgement of authorship in the eight Dooley books published in his lifetime, a gesture in vain as he was already becoming well known. It was an immediate bestseller, gaining favorable reviews from the critics. Dunne had selected almost all of the wartime pieces for {{the second half of the}} book (in War). [...] At the time, he could not get copies of his columns from before 1895, and may have felt that non-Chicagoans would not appreciate Bridgeport; thus, just 5 of the 31 [...] "peace" [...] essays dealt only with the affairs of <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> He did include a piece that featured Molly Donahue, the new woman of the neighborhood, and also a moving tribute to a heroic local fireman.

500|$|Additional {{development}} has been ongoing {{on the campus of}} Kent State University and the largely residential neighborhood located between downtown Kent and the western edge of campus. The university began buying properties in <b>that</b> <b>neighborhood</b> in 2007 and by December 2012 had acquired 43. Construction of the University Esplanade extension, designed to link campus with downtown, started in August 2012 after several of the buildings in the area, most of which had been rental homes, were demolished or moved. The Esplanade extension continued a segment of the Portage Hike and Bike Trail that extends to Dix Stadium and was completed in October 2013. Kent State is constructing a new $48 million, [...] facility for the College of Architecture and Environmental Design along the Esplanade extension and also relocated the former home of May Prentice, the first female faculty member at Kent State, to the extension as the home for the Wick Poetry Center. Construction on the architecture building started in October 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in 2016. In total, there are plans totaling approximately $150 million for several other facilities and upgrades across campus, including a new building for the College of Applied Engineering, Sustainability and Technology and a renovation and reorganization of the facilities for the School of Art. The city and county have also seen developments in the same area. A new county municipal courthouse on East Main Street was completed in April 2014, and in 2015, Kent City Council approved the sale of the city hall complex to a private developer for construction of a five-story apartment building on the site, which opened in August 2016.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} link between the {{competitiveness}} of the local banking market, urban develop-ment, and crime. We provide micro-level evidence <b>that</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>that</b> experienced more bank mergers are subjected to future reduced loan provision, diminished local construction, lower prices and rents, an influx of poorer households, and higher crime in subsequent years. A one standard deviation increase in bank concentration raises homicide and burglary rates by approximately 1 percent.

50|$|A {{theory that}} is used to explain {{disorganization}} in the neighborhoods is the social disorganization theory which was developed based on the works of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw. This theory states <b>that</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> affected with high poverty rates and economic depression are often victim to high rates of population turnover. They are also commonly very diverse in their population. Social disorganization theory says that a high turnover rate in population lead to a failure in the development of an informal social structure, which results in difficulty in maintaining social order in a community. This is turn leads to high rates of violence and crime in <b>that</b> specific <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|R
