5|$|Born in 1131, Ladislaus was {{the second}} son of King Béla the Blind and his wife, Helena of Rascia. A few months after his birth, his mother took him and his elder brother, Géza, to an {{assembly}} held at Arad where the barons who were considered responsible for <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> of the King were massacred upon the Queen's order.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Ladislaus' brother-in-law, King Zvonimir of Croatia, in 1089 or 1090 created an {{opportunity}} for him to claim Croatia for himself. Ladislaus' sister, Helena, and several noblemen (mainly from northern Croatia) supported Ladislaus' claim. His troops occupied the lowlands, but a native claimant, Petar Svačić, resisted in the Petrova Mounts. Nevertheless, Croatia and Hungary remained closely connected for more than nine centuries. LadislausI appointed his nephew, Álmos, to administer Croatia. Although a younger son, Álmos was also favored against his brother, Coloman, when the king was thinking of his succession. Even so, Coloman succeeded his uncle in 1095, while Álmos received a separate duchy under his brother's suzerainty. Throughout Coloman's reign, the brothers' relationship remained tense, which finally led to <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> of Álmos and his infant son.|$|E
5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out <b>the</b> <b>blinding,</b> whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. These are: (i) the regions surrounding <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot maintain their spatial values; (ii) the opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot is “sewn-up”; and (iii) <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Thresoolds across <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Rather, our {{results are consistent with}} a preservation of spatial values around <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot...|$|R

40|$|We {{usually do}} not notice <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, a receptor-free region on the retina. Stimuli {{extending}} through <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot appear filled in. However, if an object does not reach through but ends in <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, it is perceived as "cut off" at the boundary. Here we show that even {{when there is no}} corresponding stimulation at opposing edges of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, well known motion-induced position shifts also extend into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot and elicit a dynamic filling-in process that allows spatial structure to be extrapolated into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. We presented observers with sinusoidal gratings that drifted into or out of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot, or flickered in counterphase. Gratings moving into <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot were perceived to be longer than those moving out of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot or flickering, revealing motion-dependent filling-in. Further, observers could perceive more of a grating's spatial structure inside <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot than would be predicted from simple filling-in of luminance information from <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot edge. This is evidence for a dynamic filling-in process that uses spatiotemporal information from the motion system to extrapolate visual percepts into the scotoma of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> spot. Our findings also provide further support for the notion that an explicit spatial shift of topographic representations contributes to motion-induced position illusions...|$|R
25|$|In December John IV, who {{had been}} left behind at Nicaea, was blinded and relegated to a monastery. After {{rendering}} him ineligible for the throne, Michael VIII quickly married off John's sisters to two Italians and a Bulgarian noble, so their descendants could not threaten his own children's claim to the imperial succession. Although Michael tried to keep <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> of John a secret, the news eventually leaked out and Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos excommunicated Michael VIII. This ban was not lifted until six years later (1268) on the appointment of patriarch Joseph I.|$|E
25|$|In 1621, Abbas fell seriously ill. His heir, Mohammed Khodabanda, {{thought he}} was on his deathbed and began to {{celebrate}} his accession to the throne with his Qizilbash supporters. But the shah recovered and punished his son by blinding him, which would disqualify him from ever taking the throne. <b>The</b> <b>blinding</b> was only partially successful and the prince's followers planned to smuggle him out of the country to safety with the Mughals whose aid they would use to overthrow Abbas and install Mohammed on the throne. But the plot was betrayed, the prince's followers were executed and the prince himself imprisoned in the fortress of Alamut where he would later be murdered by Abbas' successor, Shah Safi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>blind</b> {{have so many}} inconveniences {{in their}} lives. In recent years, more and more blind {{sidewalks}} are designed and built for them. This {{is good news for}} <b>the</b> <b>blind.</b> However, people would consciously or unconsciously leave some stuff on <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> sidewalk. Therefore, <b>the</b> occupation of <b>blind</b> sidewalk is a serious problem gradually. We decided to develop an application on smartphone to help <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> to avoid troubles referred above. Within the camera on the smartphone, the application detects obstacles on <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> sidewalk based on image processing and warns <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> that there are obstacles in front of him. This paper proposed an approach on detecting <b>the</b> direction of <b>blind</b> sidewalk after <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> sidewalk to avoid the obstacles. We used several algorithms of image processing and conduct several experiments to exam this system...|$|R

500|$|Béla's {{blindness}} {{prevented him}} from administering his kingdom without assistance. He put his trust in his wife and her brother Beloš. Both royal and private charters from Béla's reign emphasize Queen Helena's pre-eminent role in the decision-making process, proving that the king regarded his wife as his co-ruler. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, at [...] "an assembly of the realm near Arad" [...] in early to mid-1131, Queen Helena ordered the slaughter of all noblemen who were accused of having suggested <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> of her husband to King Coloman.

500|$|Kamikaze (神風) is a Japanese word, usually {{translated}} as divine wind, {{believed to be}} a gift from the gods. The term is first known to have been used as the name of a pair or series of typhoons that are said to have saved Japan from two Mongol fleets under Kublai Khan that attacked Japan in 1274 and again in 1281. Protestant Wind is a name for the storm that deterred the Spanish Armada from an invasion of England in 1588 where the wind played a pivotal role, or the favorable winds that enabled William of Orange to invade England in 1688. During Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, the French soldiers had a hard time with the khamsin wind: when the storm appeared [...] "as a blood-stint in the distant sky", the natives went to take cover, while the French [...] "did not react until it was too late, then choked and fainted in <b>the</b> <b>blinding,</b> suffocating walls of dust". During the North African Campaign of the World War II, [...] "allied and German troops were several times forced to halt in mid-battle because of sandstorms caused by khamsin ... Grains of sand whirled by the wind blinded the soldiers and created electrical disturbances that rendered compasses useless." ...|$|E

In addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including one who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks {{to crack down on the}} protesters. The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.

500|$|Little else is {{recorded}} about Ealdorman Ælfhelm's career before his death. Notice of the latter, with <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> {{of his two}} sons, comes in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which related under the year 1006:In this year Archbishop Ælfric died and Bishop Ælfheah succeeded him to the archiepiscopal see. In the same year Wulfgeat was deprived of all his property, and Wulfheah and Ufegeat were blinded and Ealdorman Ælfhelm killed. The Worcester Chronicle, which for this period consists of entries taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle supplemented with extra information, gives an expanded saga-like version of this account, attributing Ælfhelm's death to Eadric Streona:The crafty and treacherous Eadric Streona, plotting to deceive the noble ealdorman Ælfhelm, prepared a great feast for him at Shrewsbury at which, when he came as a guest, Eadric greeted {{him as if he}} were an intimate friend. But on the third or fourth day of the feast, when an ambush had been prepared, he took him into the wood to hunt. When all were busy with the hunt, one Godwine Porthund (which means the town dog) a Shrewsbury butcher, whom Eadric had dazzled long before with great gifts and many promises so that he might perpetrate the crime, suddenly leapt out from the ambush, and execrably slew the ealdorman Ælfhelm. After a short space of time his sons, Wulfheah and Ufegeat, were blinded, at King Æthelred’s command, at Cookham, where he himself was then staying. This material in the Worcester Chronicle seems to have been part of a lost saga about Eadric Streona, not extant but used by various surviving 11th- and 12th-century sources. Kapelle thought Ælfhelm's murder, conducted without King Æthelred's displeasure, was the result of suspect loyalty in the face of Scandinavian invasions.|$|E
500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{received}} mixed praise from trade publications. The Mirror commended the film for the clever adaptation which preserved coherency in the story, the good acting and adequate costuming despite a few {{flaws in the}} production. Among the errors highlighted by the Mirror was Eliza's ice scene and another scene where the black actors wore inaccurate attire such as a laborer who wore a fine shirt and tie. The Morning Telegraph reviewer did not care for the production much, finding issues with the adaptation, the acting and the scenes. The Moving Picture News was more positive in its review, praising the photography and the sensible adaptation of the book to the film format. Three different reviews in The Moving Picture World were published, each of which were positive. In contrast to the fault found in the Mirror, one of the reviewers specifically praised the ice scene by stating, [...] "This {{part of the picture}} seems to have been conceived and carried out with extraordinary realism. You see the snow falling, the ice floes cracking and moving, you felt the danger that the woman and child were running as they made their escape across the ice, pursued by their remorseless enemy through <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> snowstorm. This is one of the finest effects I have seen on the moving picture screen, and the whole story, so far as I have seen it, is worked out with wonderful realism, effect and verisimilitude. It's as good a rendering of the subject as I have ever seen, and I have seen Uncle Tom's Cabin played several times." [...] The Leavenworth Times of Leavenworth, Kansas had an article reviewing the production and offered much praise for adaptation.|$|E
500|$|Several scenes {{within the}} film depict violence, torture and cruelty toward animals, leading to {{controversy}} and censorship attempts {{upon completion of}} the film. Most of these scenes took place during the raid of Vladimir, showing for example <b>the</b> <b>blinding</b> and the torture of a monk. Most of the scenes involving cruelty toward animals were simulated. For example, during the Tatar raid of Vladimir a cow is set on fire. In reality the cow had an asbestos-covered coat and was not physically harmed; however, one scene depicts the real death of a horse. The horse falls from a flight of stairs and is then stabbed by a spear. To produce this image, Tarkovsky injured the horse by shooting it in the neck and then pushed it from the stairs, causing the animal to falter and fall down the flight of stairs. [...] From there, the camera pans off the horse onto some soldiers to the left and then pans back right onto the horse, and we see the horse struggling to get its footing having fallen over on its back before being stabbed by the spear. [...] The animal was then shot in the head afterward off camera. This was done to avoid the possibility of harming what was considered a lesser expendable, highly prized stunt horse. The horse was brought in from a slaughterhouse, killed on set, and then returned to the abattoir for commercial consumption. In a 1967 interview for Literaturnoe obozrenie, interviewer Aleksandr Lipkov suggested to Tarkovsky that [...] "the cruelty in the film is shown precisely to shock and stun the viewers. And this may even repel them." [...] In an attempt to downplay the cruelty Tarkovsky responded: [...] "No, I don't agree. This does not hinder viewer perception. Moreover we did all this quite sensitively. I can name films that show much more cruel things, compared to which ours looks quite modest." ...|$|E
