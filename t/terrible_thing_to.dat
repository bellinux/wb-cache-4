500|$|The {{damage done}} by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the {{destruction}} of property. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it is a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have to deal with." [...] He added, [...] "You {{want to make sure}} that it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|This period {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind Is a <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Taste; Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also began working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks.

2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Missy Elliott for Mass Confusion Productions, with additional production by Kanye West. Lee Hatim is also credited {{in the song}} because it contains excerpts from The Masquerader' 1975 single, [...] "It's a <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Waste Your Love." [...] West previously sampled the track in his own demo recording, [...] "Apologize", which was later released on his 2005 mixtape Freshmen Adjustment. [...] "Knock Knock" [...] was recorded by Carlos Bedoya at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida with further assistance from Marcella Araica. Scott Kieklak mixed the song, while mastering was overseen by Tom Coyne. Elliott also provided additional vocals.|$|E
2500|$|The follow-up, The Mind Is a <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Taste was {{supported}} by a tour from 1989 to 1990. Due to the complex nature of the album's drumming, a second drummer, Martin Atkins, was used. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of Chris Connelly (keyboards and vocals), Nivek Ogre (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists Mike Scaccia, Terry Roberts, and William Tucker, with Jourgensen, Barker and Rieflin serving as the group's core members. This tour was documented on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up. Two singles, [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (for which a video was made) and [...] "So What" [...] were released from the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Monica, taken from her fourth studio album After the Storm (2003). It was written and produced by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and commissioned following the delay and subsequent reconstruction of Monica's 2002 album, All Eyez on Me. One out {{of a handful of}} tracks which Elliott contributed, the song incorporates elements of 1970s-style soul and quiet storm, as well as hip hop, and is built around excerpts of the record [...] "It's a <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>to</b> Waste Your Love" [...] as written by Lee Hatim and released by The Masqueraders in 1976.

2500|$|The entire {{matter was}} called [...] "a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{do to the}} American people" [...] by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The rapid growth of {{television}} as a new technology in the 1950s occurred at such a rate that laws and prohibitions could not keep up. This medium was so new that people recognized neither its dangers nor its potential for manipulation. All of the regulations regarding television at that time were defined under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which dealt with the advertising, fair competition, and labeling of broadcast stations. The Act and regulations written by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were indefinite in regards to fixed television programs. Due {{to the fact that}} there were no specific laws regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, it is debatable whether the producers or contestants alike did anything wrong. Instead, it could be inferred that the medium was ill-used.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind is a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.") ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E

2500|$|Templer {{remained}} with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, {{he was sent}} to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener's Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer's arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his 'C' Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer's battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion in , now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, [...] "I still sometimes in my sleep at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. It was a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties". A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.|$|E
