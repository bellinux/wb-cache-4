25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used {{to power}} {{electric}} stoves from a single-phase line have to be rated for greater current values than ones for <b>three-phase</b> <b>system</b> because all the power has to be transferred through a single line. Electric stoves are often hardwired to the electrical supply system, connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector or with non-standard high power proprietary domestic connector (as some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves). In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32A connector.|$|E
25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti {{went into}} this {{business}} in 1882 when {{he set up a}} shop in London designing various electrical devices. Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, {{and was one of the}} few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of Lord Kelvin, Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and transformer in 1882. John Hopkinson, a British physicist, invented the three-wire (<b>three-phase)</b> <b>system</b> for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882.|$|E
25|$|Three-phase AC railway {{electrification}} {{was used in}} Italy, Switzerland and the United States {{in the early twentieth}} century. Italy was the major user, for lines in the mountainous regions of northern Italy from 1901 until 1976. The first lines were the Burgdorf-Thun line in Switzerland (1899), and the lines of the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina from Colico to Chiavenna and Tirano in Italy, which were electrified in 1901 and 1902. Other lines where the <b>three-phase</b> <b>system</b> were used were the Simplon Tunnel in Switzerland from 1906 to 1930, and the Cascade Tunnel of the Great Northern Railway in the United States from 1909 to 1927.|$|E
50|$|The {{symmetric}} <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> {{described here}} are simply {{referred to as}} <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> because, although {{it is possible to}} design and implement asymmetric <b>three-phase</b> power <b>systems</b> (i.e., with unequal voltages or phase shifts), they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems.|$|R

25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a <b>three-phase</b> <b>system</b> may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{four-wire}} <b>three-phase</b> <b>system,</b> {{sometimes called}} [...] "four-wire wye", the safety ground {{is connected to}} a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. [...] Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. [...] In the U.S., the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type. [...] In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.|$|E
2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a <b>three-phase</b> <b>system</b> is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.|$|E

It is found that the patterns of the PV Curves of unbalanced <b>three-phase</b> power <b>systems</b> are quite different from that of balanced <b>three-phase</b> power <b>systems</b> or positive-sequence power systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 There {{has been}} a large {{increase}} in the number of <b>three-phase</b> diagnostic x-ray <b>systems</b> installed in hospital special-procedure rooms during the last decade. The reason for this is the capability of <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> of making possible the very short exposure times and increased tube loading required for some of the recently developed radiological procedures. Analysis of the voltage waveforms indicates that x-ray beams produced by <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> have a higher effective energy and a higher exposure rate than those produced by single-phase equipment operated at the same kilovoltage and tube current. This study compares dose distributions for single- and <b>three-phase</b> x-ray <b>systems</b> operated under conditions similar to those used in medical radiography. Depth-dose data were taken using thermoluminescent dosimeters in a tissue equivalent (Mix D) phantom at 40, 60, 80, 100, 125, and 150 kVp. Measurements were made at 1 cm intervals from the incident phantom surface to a depth of 13 cm, and at 2 cm intervals from 13 to 25 cm. The source to phantom surface distance was 30 inches. Curves of equivalent kilovoltage, which would provide approximately the same radiographic results, were derived for single- and <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems.</b> The data were normalized for equal exposures for various phantom thicknesses related to the energy used, and dose differentials were determined for both equal and equivalent kilovoltages...|$|R
5000|$|Two-phase {{electric}} power uses two AC voltages, with a 90-electrical-degree phase shift between them. Two-phase circuits may be wired with {{two pairs of}} conductors, or two wires may be combined, requiring only three wires for the circuit. Currents in the common conductor add to 1.4 times the current in the individual phases, so the common conductor must be larger. Two-phase and <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> can be interconnected by a Scott-T transformer, invented by Charles F. Scott. Very early AC machines, notably the first generators at Niagara Falls, used a two-phase system, and some remnant two-phase distribution systems still exist, but <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> have displaced the two-phase system for modern installations.|$|R

40|$|The hydrodynamics of the {{downwards}} concurrent flotation column (CDFC) of the Jameson {{design has}} been studied. The effect of operating variables {{on the gas}} holdup in two- and three-phase mixtures was measured. To measure gas holdup, the isolating technique, conductivity and pressure techniques were employed. Gas fractions between 10 and 65 % were achieved. These high holdups are a consequence of bubbles being forced downwards against their buoyancy. The high gas fraction {{may account for the}} fast flotation claimed for this cell. The conductivity technique using Maxwell's equation gave a maximum error of 6 %, in both two- and <b>three-phase</b> <b>systems</b> (considering the water-solids mixture as one phase).
