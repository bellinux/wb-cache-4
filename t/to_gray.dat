5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown <b>to</b> <b>gray.</b> There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown <b>to</b> <b>gray.</b> Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote <b>to</b> <b>Gray</b> requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with {{temperature}} changes, depending somewhat on {{the rate}} of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50°C and converts <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> selenium at 180°C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.|$|E

5|$|The fur, {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and {{yellowish}} brown on the sides. The underparts are sharply different in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, {{so that the}} fur appears grayish white. The fur is shorter and darker than in T.talamancae and softer and thicker than in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis of}} their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E

It was so popular that it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The revised version of 1768 was that later printed.|$|E

5|$|With a forearm {{length of}} 50 to 56mm (2.0 to 2.2in) in males and 46 to 53mm (1.8 to 2.1in) in females, {{this is a}} {{medium-sized}} bat. Its fur color is variable, ranging from reddish brown <b>to</b> <b>gray,</b> but it is generally darker than the species in the closely related genus Paratriaenops which also occur on Madagascar. The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the second upper premolar is displaced outside the toothrow. The maximum frequency of the echolocation call averages 94.2kHz and the species can easily be recognized {{on the basis of}} its call.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown <b>to</b> <b>gray.</b> The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E

Texas then committed a five-yard offsides penalty before Oxendine ran forward for four yards. On the next play, Oxendine fumbled the ball after {{being hit by a}} Texas defender. The loose ball was picked up by a Texas defender, who returned it to the 50-yard line. Brown threw two incomplete passes, then Tech committed a five-yard penalty. On third down, Brown completed a 21-yard pass to Davis, who gained a first down at the Tech 24-yard line. After the long gain, Brown threw two more incomplete passes. On third down, Brown threw another interception <b>to</b> <b>Gray,</b> who returned the ball to the Tech 31-yard line and allowed the Hokies' offense to return to the field with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E
5|$|The park's waterfalls expose two {{distinct}} rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The higher and more recent {{of these is}} the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> sandstone and gray to red shale. The lower and older layer is the Catskill Formation, which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The harder Huntley Mountain Formation caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation to the south. The portions of the Allegheny Front within the park are named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487.|$|E

5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} the rock {{formations}} within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green <b>to</b> <b>gray</b> sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding {{as much as the}} softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 (PA 487).|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown <b>to</b> <b>gray.</b> It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus. Among living Triaenops species, it {{is smaller than}} T.persicus and T.afer, but somewhat larger than T.parvus. The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E
