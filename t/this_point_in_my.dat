And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt to}} present a {{thorough}} discussion of the selection and acquisition of research reports {{reminds me of a}} slogan printed on my teen-age daughter's jacket: "Do you have a minute?

Within the limits of my knowledge, I will present a brief outline of the recent growth of research, some effects of this growth upon the body of report literature, some problems of the government which inhibit reporting on research, efforts of the government to improve the flow of information, and a generalized discussion of the selection and acquisition of reports.

A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders." ...|$|E
60|$|I am thus one of {{the very}} few examples, in this country, of one who has not thrown off {{religious}} belief, but never had it: I grew up in a negative state with regard to it. I looked upon the modern exactly as I did upon the ancient religion, as something which in no way concerned me. It did not seem to me more strange that English people should believe what I did not, than that the men I read of in Herodotus should have done so. History had made the variety of opinions among mankind a fact familiar to me, and this was but a prolongation of that fact. <b>This</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> early education had, however, incidentally one bad consequence deserving notice. In giving me an opinion contrary to that of the world, my father thought it necessary to give it as one which could not prudently be avowed to the world. This lesson of keeping my thoughts to myself, at that early age, was attended with some moral disadvantages; though my limited intercourse with strangers, especially such as were likely to speak to me on religion, prevented me from being placed in the alternative of avowal or hypocrisy. I remember two occasions in my boyhood, on which I felt myself in this alternative, and in both cases I avowed my disbelief and defended it. My opponents were boys, considerably older than myself: {{one of the}}m I certainly staggered at the time, but the subject was never renewed between us: the other who was surprised and somewhat shocked, did his best to convince me for some time, without effect.|$|E
40|$|I {{have three}} aims in this paper. First, I {{show that in}} order to motivate {{skepticism}} about other minds it is necessary to have both the right conception of the human body – alive and fully functioning without a connection to the mind – and the right conception of the mind – knowable directly in our own case and without the need for inference. Second, while the seventeenth-century Cartesian Gerauld de Cordemoy had the right conception of the human body and the right conception of the mind, and likely wrote the first self-standing monograph dedicated to skepticism about other minds, I show that René Descartes lacked the right conception of the human body. Instead, Descartes always maintained that the living functioning human body exists with a mind. Finally, I show that when responding to skepticism about other minds at the prompting of Henry More, Descartes did not appeal to competent language use but to natural facts about the origin of the human body. This serves to reiterate that for Descartes where there are living human bodies there are always minds. These results challenge us to reexamine the human body’s place in Descartes’ physics of extended matter. I explore <b>this</b> last <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> concluding remarks...|$|R

40|$|<b>My</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> photography {{began when}} I {{was twelve years}} old. This fascination developed because I was able to 'keep' things that I saw.

The first photographs were mainly of objects and animals [not people] and an occasional picture of a friend or familymember As my interest changed and developed photography became a way of not only holding onto an experience but the camera helped to create a new one. I can remember thinking to myself after photographing some people on a dock that I didn't care how the photographs came out but the fact that I enjoyed taking them was enough. I held onto this idea for a long time. Looking at photographs that I've taken has always served as an open door to relive the experience before, during and after the picture was taken.

60|$|That we {{may know}} the Laird better, a brief {{description}} of his home may be introduced. Within {{a mile and a half}} of the east end of Princes Street, Edinburgh, lies, on the left of the railway to the south, a squalid suburb. You drive or walk on a dirty road, north-eastwards, through unambitious shops, factories, tall chimneys, flaming advertisements, and houses for artisans. The road climbs a hill, and you begin to find, on each side of you, walls of ancient construction, and traces of great old doorways, now condemned. On the left are ploughed fields, and even clumps of trees with blackened trunks. Grimy are the stacks of corn in the farmyard to the left, at the crest of the hill. On the right, a gateway gives on a short avenue which leads to a substantial modern house. Having reached <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pilgrimage, I met a gentleman who occupies the house, and asked if I might be permitted to view the site. The other, with much courtesy, took me up to the house, of which only the portion in view from the road was modern. Facing the west all was of the old Scottish château style, with gables, narrow windows, and a strange bulky chimney on the north, bulging out of the wall. The west side of the house stood on the very brink of a steep precipice, beneath which lay what is now but a large deep waterhole, but, at the period of the Gowrie conspiracy, was a loch fringed with water weeds, and a haunt of wild fowl. By this loch, Restalrig Loch, the witch more than three centuries ago met the ghost of Tam Reid, who fell in Pinkie fight, and by the ghost was initiated into the magic which brought her to the stake.|$|E
60|$|As {{most of the}} {{movements}} of expression must have been gradually acquired, afterwards becoming instinctive, {{there seems to be}} some degree of a priori probability that their recognition would likewise have become instinctive. There is, at least, no greater difficulty in believing this than in admitting that, when a female quadruped first bears young, she knows the cry of distress of her offspring, or than in admitting that many animals instinctively recognize and fear their enemies; and of both these statements there can be no reasonable doubt. It is however extremely difficult to prove that our children instinctively recognize any expression. I attended to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first-born infant, who could not have learnt anything by associating with other children, and I was convinced that he understood a smile and received pleasure from seeing one, answering it by another, at much too early an age to have learnt anything by experience. When this child was about four months old, I made in his presence many odd noises and strange grimaces, and tried to look savage; but the noises, if not too loud, as well as the grimaces, were all taken as good jokes; and I attributed this at the time to their being preceded or accompanied by smiles. When five months old, he seemed to understand a compassionate, expression and tone of voice. When a few days over six months old, his nurse pretended to cry, and I saw that his face instantly assumed a melancholy expression, with the corners of the mouth strongly depressed; now this child could rarely have seen any other child crying, and never a grown-up person crying, and I should doubt whether at so early an age he could have reasoned on the subject. Therefore it seems to me that an innate feeling must have told him that the pretended crying of his nurse expressed grief; and this through the instinct of sympathy excited grief in him.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how the Oktoberfest impacts on {{regional}} identity in Bavaria, with particular focus on its capital, Munich. Over the last decade, a conscious revival of Bavarian traditions at the event has become noticeable. This thesis investigates why {{there has been a}} revival of Bavarian characteristics at the Oktoberfest and seeks also to explain why this revival is occurring at <b>this</b> particular <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time. <b>My</b> investigation of the revival of regional Bavarian identity was conducted with a qualitative approach and placed in the wider context of Germany and Europe. Using theories around 'imagined communities' (Anderson, 1991), 'communities' boundaries' (Cohen, 1985) and 'invented traditions' (Hobsbawm, 1983), I show that, alongside the historical and political background of Bavaria, wider trends and developments in the course of Europeanisation and globalisation have {{played a significant role in}} the increasing interest in and emphasis on Bavarian identity in Munich. The research showed that the Oktoberfest offers the most prominent occasion for the Munich locals to display Bavarian traditions. Moreover, it serves as a 'celebratory stage' for the locals to reassert their identity, which is stressed as being distinct from the German nation. Also, the celebration of Bavarian tradition can be interpreted as people's 'return' to their regional roots in their search for stability in a rapidly globalising world...|$|R

Firstly, we will proceed with a description of the diverse technologies utilized during the project's development for the manage of large quantities of data, and for the future automated process of supervised learning. After this, we will proceed with the study of the cases using data compiled from calls, messages, and geolocation, from which we will obtain the diverse characteristics that will later be compiled into the algorithms of the Machine Learning program. Three different systems will be designed using the features obtained from: calls, messages, and a combination of them both. On the other hand, communicational habits have shown a tremendous change since the polarization of smartphones. The use of calls has seen a steady decrease, while we progressively tend to ignore SMS's and communicate largely using instant messaging apps, like WhatsApp. For this reason, and with the objective of applying our models to the real world, the learning system created from SMS's to predict the user's personality will focus and use data entirely from WhatsApp conversations. In conclusion, this project has seen the development of three automated learning systems, with one of those previously mentioned applying data extracted from WhatsApp conversations. This has in turn lead to a greater percentage of success from the expected value, considering that there was no precedence in this area...|$|R
40|$|These {{chapters}} {{consider how}} art {{can provide a}} space for wider critical debate on established patriarchal power relations, which have operated in Western culture since the Enlightenment period. As a female artist, I want to explore the space in art of both the female body and the community body. This work seeks to position the female body within the 2 ̆ 2 form 2 ̆ 2 of her subjectivity, to destabilize patriarchal strongholds through the displacement of the traditionally aestheticised female 2 ̆ 2 nude”. That is, I examine the (historicized) notion of a “subject” and the representation of an 2 ̆ 2 object”, and understand the female 2 ̆ 2 nude” as a representation of patriarchal dominance to this day. I use my art work: of women to explore recent feminist theory that investigates these historicized notions, hoping to present images that critique rather than wholly participate {{in the tradition of}} objectifying women without question. Ultimately, I move to a broader field, to incorporate an idea of a community 2 ̆ 2 body 2 ̆ 2 that is embracing of those bodies culturally precluded from subjective empowerment. My attention is specifically focused on the remediation of the once 2 ̆ 2 derelict 2 ̆ 2 land and 2 ̆ 2 polluted 2 ̆ 2 waterways of East Perth, to the 2 ̆ 2 pristine 2 ̆ 2 condition of what is now an exclusive corporate and residential site. I intend to address my art to the many 2 ̆ 2 marginalized 2 ̆ 2 bodies, traditionally and presently obstructed from subjective representation within our Western culture. In bringing both 2 ̆ 2 bodies 2 ̆ 2 together, my art aims to help disrupt the patriarch from his central subjective stronghold. Chapter 1 explores the (assumed) privileged 2 ̆ 2 gaze 2 ̆ 2 of the Western male artist (and my own naive participation in this practice). which transforms the 2 ̆ 2 deformed 2 ̆ 2 physical 2 ̆ 2 matter” of women into the 2 ̆ 2 iconic 2 ̆ 2, conceptual 2 ̆ 2 form 2 ̆ 2 of the patriarch 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Woman 2 ̆ 2. Chapter 2 examines the space for a female voice that recent psychoanalytic theory evokes in challenging the conventions of patriarchy. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> particular, <b>my</b> praxis seeks to reflect this emergence for women, as reconnections to the 2 ̆ 2 matter 2 ̆ 2 of the maternal body are made. Chapter 3 investigates how feminist theory resists the patriarchal icon for female 2 ̆ 2 beauty 2 ̆ 2 (in the classical 2 ̆ 2 nude 2 ̆ 2), through its representation of new bodily images and identities for women. Subsequently, I journey <b>in</b> <b>my</b> visual practice <b>in</b> responding to this 2 ̆ 2 resistance 2 ̆ 2, and focus specifically on the feminist notion of 2 ̆ 2 ambiguity 2 ̆ 2 for female self-expression, as a means to subversively obstructing patriarchal hegemony. Chapter 4 articulates the significance of 2 ̆ 2 desire 2 ̆ 2 for women in their discovery of themselves at an intimate level, without the intervention of masculine visual penetration. I represent this intimacy (this 2 ̆ 2 divinity 2 ̆ 2 for women), through tactile qualities <b>in</b> <b>my</b> practice, which serve to connect women to themselves, whilst interrupting the penetration of the patriarchal gaze. Finally, Chapter 5 shows how the resistance and corporeality of the female body comes to symbolize the existence of the “community body 2 ̆ 2 that works to reclaim a 2 ̆ 2 presence 2 ̆ 2 (a place of domicile) within the redeveloped site of East Perth...|$|R
