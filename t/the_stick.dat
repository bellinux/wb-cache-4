40|$|The Fe 2 O 3 {{particles}} {{with the}} diameter between 74 and 150 mu m were pre-reduced with CO at 923 K to precipitate the carbon on the surface.

For clarifying the prevention mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>sticking,</b> <b>the</b> carbon in different states was characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and its effects on <b>sticking</b> were discussed. <b>The</b> carbon on the surface was divided into two states, the graphitic carbon and the carbon in Fe 3 C.

40|$|Sticking of H and D atoms on {{interstellar}} dust grains {{is the first}} step in molecular hydrogen formation, which is a key reaction in the InterStellar Medium (ISM). After studying <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficients of H 2 and D 2 molecules on amorphous silicate surfaces experimentally and theoretically, we extrapolate the results to <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient of atoms and propose a formulae that gives <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficients of H and D on both silicates and icy dust grains. In our experiments, we used the King and Wells method for measuring <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficients of H 2 and D 2 molecules on a silicate surface held at 10 K. It consists of measuring with a QMS (quadrupole mass spectrometer) the signals of H 2 and D 2 molecules reflected by the surface during the exposure of the sample to the molecular beam at a temperature ranging from 20 K to 340 K. We tested the efficiency of a physical model, developed previously for sticking on water-ice surfaces. We applied this model to our experimental results for <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficients of H 2 and D 2 molecules on a silicate surface and estimated <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient of atoms by a single measurement of atomic recombination and propose an extrapolation. Sticking of H, D, HD, H 2, and D 2 on silicates grains behaves the same as on icy dust grains. <b>The</b> <b>sticking</b> decreases with <b>the</b> gas temperature, and is dependent on the mass of <b>the</b> impactor. <b>The</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient for both surfaces and impactors can be modeled by an analytical formulae S(T), which describes both the experiments and the thermal distribution expected in an astrophysical context.

40|$|DoctorSticking {{phenomenon}} occurring during {{hot rolling}} {{of the five}} kinds of ferritic stainless steels, STS 445 NF and the modified stainless steels, was investigated in this study. Hot-rolling simulation tests were conducted by a high-temperature wear tester which could simulate actual hot rolling. The simulation test results revealed that <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> process proceeded with three stages, i. e., nucleation, growth, and saturation. Since the hardness continuously decreased as the test temperature increased, whereas the formation of Fe-Cr oxides in the rolled steel surface region increased, <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> of five stainless steels was evaluated by considering both the high-temperature hardness and oxidation effects. The addition of Zr, Cu, or Si had a beneficial effect on <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> resistance, while <b>the</b> Ni addition did not show any difference in <b>the</b> <b>sticking.</b> Particularly in <b>the</b> case of the Si addition, Si oxides formed first in the initial stage of high-temperature oxidation, worked as initiation sites for Fe-Cr oxides, accelerated the formation of Fe-Cr oxides, and thus raised <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> resistance by about 10 times {{in comparison with the}} steel without Si content. But these results can’t show the actual rolling process because it had no furnace condition before rolling process. So, <b>the</b> mechanisms of <b>sticking</b> phenomena occurring during hot rolling of a modified STS 445 NF ferritic stainless steel have been investigated in this study by using a pilot-plant-scale rolling machine. As the rolling pass proceeds, the Fe-Cr oxide layer formed in a reheating furnace is destroyed, and the destroyed oxides penetrate into the rolled steel to form a thin oxide layer on the surface region. <b>The</b> <b>sticking</b> does not occur on the surface region containing oxides, whereas it occurs on the surface region without oxides by the separation of the rolled steel at high temperatures. This indicates that <b>the</b> resistance to <b>sticking</b> increases by <b>the</b> increase in the surface hardness when a considerable amount of oxides are formed on the surface region, and that <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> can be evaluated by the volume fraction and distribution of oxides formed on the surface region. The addition of Zr, Cu had a beneficial effect on <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> resistance, while <b>the</b> Ni addition did not show any difference in <b>the</b> <b>sticking.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand Si had a harmful effect on <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> resistance. <b>The</b> lubrication and the increase of the rolling speed and rolling temperature beneficially affect to <b>the</b> resistance to <b>sticking</b> because they accelerate the formation of oxides on the steel surface region. In order to prevent or minimize <b>the</b> <b>sticking,</b> thus, it is suggested to increase the thickness of the oxide layer formed in the reheating furnace and to homogeneously distribute oxides along the surface region by controlling the hot-rolling process...|$|R
