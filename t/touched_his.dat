5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

Tomita competed in both the parallel bars and high bar competition. Tomita was 6th at the parallel bars because of some visible mistakes. In his final competition in the high bar, Tomita performed with his signature skills and elegance, the only obvious error he committed was when he <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand to the mat after his dismount.

500|$|Yorkshire {{appointed}} Major Arthur Lupton as captain, {{hoping that}} {{his experience in}} the army {{would allow him to}} exercise greater control than his predecessors had managed. Aged 46, he was old for a cricketer. He had played once for Yorkshire in 1908, but was no longer an effective batsman. He was very popular with the players, and managed to improve discipline but had little influence on team tactics. He left such matters to Rhodes and Robinson, to the point where several apocryphal stories emerged about his lack of control. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm and said, [...] "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [...]" [...] After three years in charge, Lupton resigned the captaincy at the end of 1927. In their search for a successor, Yorkshire hoped to appoint a player with a better cricketing reputation who would serve for a longer term.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{meeting with}} Bhansali, Kumar {{told him about}} the film; he {{explained}} that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to hear the story and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, he liked it and immediately agreed to produce the film. However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience. This concern evaporated after the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Kom won a bronze medal. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements. After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Bhansali revealed that the story of the film was so inspiring, it <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> heart and described the film as [...] "a rare experiment". He added [...] "Not many films are based on biopics of living people. I am proud that I am part of this film." ...|$|E

[...] Holly George-Warren, editor and author of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: The First 25 Years, said: [...] "With the death of Keith Moon in 1978, rock arguably lost its single greatest drummer." [...] According to Eder, [...] "Moon, with his manic, lunatic side, and his life of excessive drinking, partying, and other indulgences, probably represented the youthful, zany side of rock & roll, {{as well as its}} self-destructive side, better than anyone else on the planet." [...] The New Book of Rock Lists ranked Moon No.1 on its list of [...] "50 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Drummers," [...] and he was ranked No.2 on the 2011 Rolling Stone [...] "Best Drummers of All Time" [...] readers' poll. In 2016, the same magazine ranked him No. 2 in their list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, behind John Bonham. Adam Budofsky, editor of Drummer magazine, said that Moon's performances on Who's Next and Quadrophenia [...] "represent a perfect balance of technique and passion" [...] and [...] "there's been no drummer who's <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> unique slant on rock and rhythm since." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted [...] for the device. Although the music video for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award {{for the quality of}} the special effects used in its production.

500|$|In each of {{the four}} seasons from 1922 to 1925, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, {{averaging}} over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season. Rhodes, by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used. Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days, he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen. He took over 100 wickets in 1922, 1923 and 1924, but took only 57 in 1925, a very good year for batting. As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period. He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers, directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding. Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; for example, Arthur Lupton, captain from 1925 to 1927, [...] "very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson." [...] Stories emerged that he was an [...] "overmighty subject", arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm and said, [...] "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [...]" [...] However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, although they agreed that he could be difficult. [...] Beverley Lyon, who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934, criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.|$|E
