50|$|In {{the context}} of the European Transparency Initiative, which was {{introduced}} in 2005 by EU Commissioner Siim Kallas, the European Commission introduced the voluntary register of lobbyists in the European Union on 23 June 2008. The so-called Transparency-register of both European Parliament and EU Commission was established three years later, on the 23 of June 2011. The registration is not mandatory, however, it is a precondition to accreditation and physical access to buildings of the European Parliament. The objective of the joint transparency register is to increase transparency of the EU lobbying system by enabling public inspection of the lobbying process itself, including an insight on who the lobbyists are, that try to shape EU governance, and whose interests they represent. Organisations as well as private actors and individuals can register in one of the six broadly composed categories of the Transparency Register. These include law firms, <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations,</b> non-governmental-organisations (NGOs) and organisations which represent interests of local, regional or communal authorities and other public institutions. Moreover, during the process of registration the applicant must provide certain information which is published on the website of the Transparency Register by the European Union. These include the main office, the particular ambition, mission and interests, memberships, clients and an estimate of financial resources including received EU funding. By registering, applicants agree to a unitary code of conduct.|$|E

The cases show that the promotion of IEC requires highly targeted competencies that are not generally available in local organisations, and this may cause the failure of the activities promoted...|$|E

Drawing on both literatures, the article compares the lobbying strategies of U. S. and Canadian interest groups during the economic crisis of 2008 [...] 2009. The impact of political institutional and political partisan factors on venue choice is analyzed in a comparative crucial case study of Michigan and Ontario. Statistical analysis of original survey data from ninety-eight business, <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> indicates that neither interest group financial resources nor {{the severity of the}} crisis predict lobbying frequencies or targets. Two factors strongly influence where interest groups lobby: the relative importance of the government levels and the partisan control of government. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} outlines, first, {{the characteristics}} of effective regulation overall; second the essential ingredients for financial services and securities regulation. The regulatory agency has become an essential tool of governance today. In {{a wide variety of}} sectors, governments attempt to direct and control the activities of business through different statutory regimes, via agencies using strategies ranging from friendly advice to criminal charges. The targets of regulation, the companies in each sector, respond to government regulation in a variety of ways, from total engagement/compliance to overt or covert resistance and defiance. Overall levels of compliance vary, first, with the history and internal organization of a particular business, its sector, size, profitability and geographic location; second with {{the characteristics of}} the regulatory agency, specifically its size, history and resources; and third, with the nature and strength of 3 rd parties invested in the regulatory process – for example, NGOs, <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations,</b> pressure, interest and protest groups (Braithwaite &...|$|E
40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Irish business stems from {{their tendency to}} rely on single products or market characteristics for success, instead of developing a comprehensive marketing strategy Desk research was undertaken {{in order to develop}} a better understanding of services marketing and create a background of the tourism industry. The nature of services was identified,as well as the processof the development of Irish services,along with the increasing dependence on services for employment. The influence of consumerism and decision-making was also studied. Primary research focuses on the Hotel and Catering industry,with specific reference to the ways these two segments pursue their marketing strategies. It was found that the majority of problems confronting the two are {{as a result of the}} scale of operations vis. a highly fragmented industry which suffers from the lack of professional marketing skills. The main <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> do not appear to be meeting the needs of the typical small firms in hotel and catering in Dublin.

This paper discusses the components of a successful assessment, what you can expect, {{and how you can}} benefit. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Industrial Assessment Center Program, its track record and its approach, are described in some detail -including the criteria for receiving an assessment through the Program.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] In every country, {{standardization}} {{is a reflection of}} that nation's level of industrialization. Creating consistent, widely adopted standards helps industries manufacture products in ways that are efficient, safe, repeatable, and of high quality. Standards are essential for translating new ideas, inventions, and discoveries into economic growth and prosperity. Whether standards originate from national governments, professional associations, private enterprises, or other standard-setting entities, they capture the interdependencies among the different sectors. On a broader level, they also embrace a nation's industrial, technical, and social policies. As nations change, standardization principles and practices change with them. Nowhere is this more true than in China today, where a historic revision of the Chinese standardization regime is taking place. New methods, new ideas, and new strategies for effective standardization are percolating within Chinese government and civil society. One of the new ideas is "association standards," which are set by nonprofit, nongovernmental "social organizations" such as <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations.</b> Though widespread in the United States, association standards are in the developmental stages in China, with reform efforts now focused on increasing the decision-making autonomy of nongovernmental standard-setting organizations. This paper compares Chinese and American systems for setting industrial standards. Specifically, the paper compares the US system of voluntary standards, which relies on consensus among parties and market-driven initiatives, with current efforts to reform China's government-directed standardization system. The paper focuses on five aspects: the degree of development of these nonprofit associations, the abilities of the associations, government attitudes, market demand, and overseas experience. The paper culminates in a discussion of policy implications for China's reform efforts. An important argument is that the government should introduce pragmatic, feasible policy measures that address the needs and capabilities of standard-setting organizations. These policies can draw important lessons from the achievements of America's voluntary standard system. This would require a deep understanding of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the US approach to voluntary standards...|$|E
