5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel <b>tankage,</b> but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E

25|$|This {{problem is}} {{frequently}} solved by staging— the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty <b>tankage</b> and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either serial where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or parallel, where rockets are burning {{together and then}} detach when they burn out.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War I Bernard Langer flew a Roland Pfeilflieger, equipped with a Mercedes engine and extra <b>tankage</b> {{in place of the}} passenger, on a non-stop sixteen-hour flight. During the war at least one LFG Roland Pfeilflieger served with the Schutztruppe (Protection Force) in German South-West Africa, now Namibia between 1914 and 1915.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{accelerations}} can {{be increased}} by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by {{a reduction in the}} fuel load and <b>tankage</b> and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{derivative of}} the A321, the A321-100, featured {{a reduction in}} range compared to the A320 as extra fuel <b>tankage</b> was not added to the initial design {{to compensate for the}} extra weight. The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the A321-100 was increased to 83,000kg (183,000lb). The A321-100 entered service with Lufthansa in 1994. Only about 90 were ever produced.|$|E
25|$|Thus far, the {{required}} velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattainable by any single rocket because the propellant, <b>tankage,</b> structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass {{that is too}} great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has {{so far not been}} achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, American Jet Industries {{began work}} on a turboprop-powered {{conversion}} of the Cessna 402, named the Turbo Star 402, using Allison 250-B17 engines. The prototype flew on 10 June 1970. Further modifications providing increased fuel <b>tankage,</b> higher gross weight, and lower minimum control speed were carried out in 1974 and the modification was recertificated. Scenic Airlines of Las Vegas purchased {{the rights to the}} design in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} R-2 {{originally}} used a 550hp Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior nine cylinder radial powerplant, as the aircraft was designed {{primarily as a}} cross-country racer with increased <b>tankage</b> that did not require the larger 800hp Wasp. In 1933, the R-2 was modified for closed-circuit racing and was fitted with the more powerful engine and cowling of the R-1 version. Other modifications included a larger wing, equipped with flaps.|$|E
25|$|The fourth is {{the maximum}} delta-v this {{technique}} can give (without staging). For rocket-like propulsion systems {{this is a}} function of mass fraction and exhaust velocity. Mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by propulsion system weight and <b>tankage</b> weight. For a system to achieve this limit, typically the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.|$|E
25|$|The Re.2000 had no {{fuel tanks}} {{contained}} within the fuselage; nevertheless, using {{the entirety of the}} wing's internal volume for fuel <b>tankage,</b> it could house a maximum of 460kg (640 lt) of gasoline, providing it with a 900–1,100km endurance, far in excess of its contemporary rivals built by Macchi and Fiat. However, the Re.2000 was considered to be not as rugged as its Macchi-built contemporaries; specifically, its fuel tanks were considered to be vulnerable, which were not of the self-sealing variety then becoming popular in military service. It has been claimed that this lack of durability had been a major factor when, following an official evaluation by the Regia Aeronautica, the service decided to reject the type.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage F1 used a shoulder-mounted swept wing, {{instead of}} the Delta wing of the Mirage III, which {{resulted}} in a more than 50% reduction in required runway lengths and increased internal fuel <b>tankage</b> for 40% greater combat range. The approach speed prior to landing is 25% less than the preceding Mirage IIIE. According to Dassault, the negative performance impact associated with the increased thickness of the Mirage F1's wing over the Mirage III's counterpart had been offset by improvements made to the propulsion system. The wing is fitted with both double-slotted trailing edge flaps and full-span leading edge slats, the latter being automatically operated to reduce the aircraft's turn radius during combat.|$|E
25|$|A final consideration, {{especially}} for the Great Plains Project, {{was the use of}} methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 had to be very large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel <b>tankage,</b> and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul liquified natural gas, using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) was an obvious choice. Methane burns much cleaner than jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place.|$|E
500|$|The 767-300ER, the extended-range {{version of}} the 767-300, entered service with American Airlines in 1988. The type's {{increased}} range {{was made possible by}} greater fuel <b>tankage</b> and a higher MTOW of [...] Design improvements allowed the available MTOW to increase to [...] by 1993. Power is provided by Pratt & Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6, or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Typical routes for the type include Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The combination of increased capacity and range offered by the 767-300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators. It is the most successful {{version of the}} aircraft, with more orders placed than all other variants combined. As of September 2017, 767-300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders. There were 441 examples in service as of July 2016. The type's main competitor is the Airbus A330-200.|$|E
500|$|More {{influential}} {{than the}} 707 in the 698's design was wind-tunnel testing {{performed by the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, which indicated {{the need for a}} wing redesign to avoid the onset of compressibility drag which would have restricted the maximum speed. Painted gloss white, the 698 prototype VX770 flew {{for the first time on}} 30 August 1952 piloted by Roly Falk flying solo. The prototype 698, then fitted with only the first-pilot's ejection seat and a conventional control wheel, was powered by four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon engines of [...] thrust; there were no wing fuel tanks, temporary <b>tankage</b> was carried in the bomb bay. VX770 made an appearance at the 1952 Society of British Aircraft Constructors' (SBAC) Farnborough Air Show the next month when Falk demonstrated an almost vertical bank. After its Farnborough appearance, the future name of the Avro 698 was a subject of speculation; Avro had strongly recommended the name Ottawa, in honour of the company's connection with Avro Canada. Weekly magazine Flight suggested Albion after rejecting Avenger, Apollo and Assegai. The chief of the air staff preferred a V-class of bombers, and the Air Council announced the following month that the 698 would be called Vulcan after the Roman god of fire and destruction. In January 1953, VX770 was grounded for the installation of wing fuel tanks, Armstrong Siddeley ASSa.6 Sapphire engines of [...] thrust and other systems; it flew again in July 1953.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Saturation System" [...] or [...] "Saturation spread" [...] {{typically}} {{includes a}} living chamber, transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber, which is {{commonly referred to}} in commercial diving and military diving as the diving bell, PTC (Personnel Transfer Capsule) or SDC (Submersible Decompression Chamber). The system can be permanently placed on a ship or ocean platform, but is more commonly capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. The entire system is managed from a control room (van), where depth, chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system <b>tankage</b> bulkhead by a trunking space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer {{to and from the}} bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at rates of about of 15 to 30msw (50 to 100fsw) per day, (schedules vary). Thus the process involves only one ascent, thereby mitigating the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of multiple decompressions normally associated with non-saturation ("bounce diving") operations. The chamber gas mixture is typically controlled to maintain a nominally constant partial pressure of oxygen of between 0.3 and 0.5 bar during most of the decompression (0.44 to 0.48bar on US Navy schedule), which is below the upper limit for long term exposure. NOAA has used rather different saturation decompression schedules for relatively shallow (less than 100fsw) air and nitrox saturation dives, which use oxygen breathing when pressure is reduced to less than 55fsw.|$|E

The additional fuel <b>tankage</b> increases the total capacity of this model to [...] These modifications also increased the maximum takeoff weight of the A321-200 to [...] This variant first flew in December 1996, and entered service with Monarch Airlines in April 1997. Its direct competitors include the 757–200 and the 737-900/900ER.|$|E
2500|$|As the war progressed, {{there were}} {{instances}} when the dive bombers were pressed into duty as fighters in the interceptor role, their maneuverability being {{enough to allow}} them to survive in this role. In June 1942, an improved version of the D3A powered by a [...] Kinsei 54 was tested as the Model 12. The extra power reduced range, so the design was further modified with additional fuel tanks to bring the total <b>tankage</b> to , giving it the range needed to fight effectively over the Solomon Islands.

Extra cabin windows can be fitted if the [...] "kiddie seats" [...] are to be used. The MX-7 uses the same fuselage as the M-6,which is a modified M5 fuselage but the same wing span as the M-5, and incorporates the increased fuel <b>tankage,</b> hoerner style wing tip [...] and five-position flaps designed for the M-7.|$|E
2500|$|While the Tiger VIII engine {{used in the}} Whitley Mks II and III {{was more}} {{reliable}} than those used in early aircraft, the Whitley was re-engined with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in 1938, giving rise to the Whitley Mk IV.

Other changes made included {{the replacement of the}} manually operated tail and retractable ventral turrets with a Nash & Thompson powered turret equipped with four [...]303in (7.7mm) Browning machine guns, the increasing of fuel <b>tankage</b> capacity, including two additional fuel tanks in the wing. A total of 40 Whitley Mk IV and Whitley Mk IVA, a sub-variant featuring more powerful models of the Merlin engine, were completed.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{featured}} a conformal ventral store to house either a fuel tank or a rocket engine. The rocket engine, a Napier Double Scorpion motor, also contained a reserve of [...] of high-test peroxide (HTP) {{to drive the}} rocket’s turbopump and act as an oxidizer; fuel would have been drawn from the aircraft internal <b>tankage.</b> The rocket engine was intended {{at an early stage}} in the Lightning’s development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted; the subsequent basic performance with reheated Avons was deemed sufficient and the rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958.

[...] These it passed with flying colours, its performance better than predicted and with perfect reliability. In early 1929 the Vellore was {{fitted with a}}n Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar VI and extra <b>tankage</b> in the freight compartment for a flight to Australia. Leaving Lympne on 18 March 1929 with a full 5,000lb (2,270kg) load including the extra fuel, the Vellore II (or Jaguar-Vellore) made Benghazi in stages before engine trouble brought on a forced landing. [...] After spares were sent out the flight continued until, over the Timor Sea and close to Australia, the engine began to malfunction again and the Vellore was wrecked in trees near the Cape Don lighthouse at the western extremity of the Cobourg Peninsula on the Australian mainland.
