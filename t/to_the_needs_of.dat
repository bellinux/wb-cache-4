London's main port is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived {{the closure of the}} inner docks.

5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists.

Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing.
