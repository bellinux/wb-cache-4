5|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, one faction of Orcs {{demanded that the}} portal be closed. However a chief of {{exceptional}} cunning realized that <b>the</b> <b>Humans,</b> although out-numbered, had prevailed {{through the use of}} superior tactics, organization, and by magic. He united the clans, imposed discipline on their army and sought new magics from the Warlocks and Necromancers. Their combined forces were ready to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Humans.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village.

The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, <b>the</b> <b>Humans</b> had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which <b>the</b> <b>Humans</b> had not discovered.|$|E

When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from <b>the</b> <b>humans</b> and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. <b>The</b> <b>humans</b> notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew – impossibly spindly creatures, who communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send messages to <b>the</b> <b>humans.</b> As her attempts to transmit from the civilization's territory are ineffective, she travels to a mountain range to transmit directly under the spacecraft – conquering the fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67billion g. <b>The</b> <b>humans</b> recognize her message and realize that the cheela live a million times faster than humans.|$|E

5|$|About 10,000years ago <b>the</b> <b>humans</b> who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
