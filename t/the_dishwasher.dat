5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher,</b> causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E

25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher,</b> and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>{{dishwasher}}</b> cleans dishes, glassware, {{and eating}} utensils. The first dishwasher was a wooden one whereby {{a person would}} turn a handle to splash water on the dishware. It was invented in 1850 by Joel Houghton of Ogden, New York. The device was a failure. Houghton received U.S. patent #7,365 on May 14, 1850. The first successful and practical dishwasher was invented in 1886 by Josephine Cochrane. The motorized device turned a wheel while soapy water squirted up and rained down on the dishware.

50|$|Smith {{wants to}} know why <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> is not working. Jones tells him that the {{basement}} lights have to be on before <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> will work. Smith doesn't understand the connection between the functioning of <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> and the status of the basement lights, so Jones explains that <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> is connected to the basement lights in a series circuit. This is an example of mechanistic explanation. In order to explain the phenomenon of the malfunctioning dishwasher, Jones has to appeal to the lower-level components of the circuit process, like a light switch and the wiring. Jones has to appeal to the organization of those components, i.e. the serial organization of the circuit. Jones also has to appeal to a causal aspect, the light switch being on completes the circuit, and thus allows power to flow to <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher.</b> After Jones explains those aspects of the mechanism, Smith is able to understand the connection between <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> and the basement lights. This example, though imperfect, does help to illustrate mechanistic explanation.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from <b>the</b> water. <b>Dishwasher</b> salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit; unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not contain added insoluble anticaking agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may contain added iodine {{in the form of}} sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher's</b> water softening unit can damage it.|$|R

5000|$|In the 2010s {{manufactures}} routinely offered various {{new energy}} conservation features in dishwashers.

When <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> had cleaned the dishes {{to the point of}} not releasing more food particles, then the soil sensor would report the dishes being cleaned. The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time. If dishes were especially dirty, then <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> saves energy and water by only being in operation for as long as needed.|$|E

50|$|European dishwashers {{almost universally}} use {{two or three}} spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> leaving both racks {{unimpeded}} and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements {{in the base of}} the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use more basic and old fashioned water distribution and exposed elements in the base of <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher.</b> Some North American machines use a large cone or similar structure in the bottom dish rack to prevent placement of dishes {{in the center of the}} rack. <b>The</b> <b>dishwasher</b> directs water from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher</b> up through this structure to the upper wash arm to spray water on the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from Whirlpool and Kitchenaid, use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of <b>the</b> <b>dishwasher,</b> which allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model Frigidaire dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).|$|E
50|$|A {{dishwasher}} is {{a mechanical}} device for cleaning dishware and cutlery.
