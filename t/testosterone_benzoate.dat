It is a prodrug of testosterone and, when administered via intramuscular injection, {{is associated with a}} long-lasting depot effect and extended duration of action.|$|E
40|$|A sample work-up and {{enrichment}} technique {{involving the}} use of supported liquid membrane (SLM) and detection by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer operating under positive ion electrospray mode (LC-PI-ESI-MS) has been developed for the determination of six anabolic androgenic compounds in different biomatrices; mainly urine, kidney, liver and milk. Anabolic androgenic compounds analysed included 17 -trenbolone, 17 -trenbolone, 19 -nortestosterone, testosterone, 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione and <b>testosterone</b> <b>benzoate.</b> Several factors affecting the extraction efficiency during SLM enrichment, such as donor pH were studied. The detection limits (DL) were 0. 08 µg L– 1 for 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione, 0. 7 ng L– 1 19 -testosterone, 1. 1 ng L– 1 for testosterone, 0. 1 ng L– 1 for 17 -trenbolone, 1. 6 ng L– 1 for 17 -trenbolone and 0. 03 µg L– 1 for <b>testosterone</b> <b>benzoate.</b> Modification at C 17 in the structures of 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione and <b>testosterone</b> <b>benzoate</b> affected their recoveries with SLM and explained their observed high detection limits...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A result {{reported}} earlier that oestradiol sensitizes {{the nervous system}} of the male rat so that it responds to testosterone with increased motor activity could not be repeated. The male and female rat respond differently, the male only to oestradiol and the female to both oestradiol and testosterone. A few rats sometimes respond to <b>testosterone.</b> Oestradiol <b>benzoate</b> pellets implanted beneath {{the skin of the}} gonadectomized rat cause both males and females to take large amounts of exercise in an activity drum. Testosterone propionate causes the females to take much exercise but has a small effect upon the males. Asdell, Doornenbal & Sperling (1962) have suggested that testosterone propionate is effective in males if the implant follows one of oestradiol benzoate. Therefore it was postulated that oestrogen sensitizes the nervous system to androgen. We have been unable to repeat this work and believe that the previous result was obtained because the testosterone implant was made before the direct effect of the oestrogen had disappeared...|$|R
5000|$|Estradiol {{phenylpropionate}} (EPP), {{also known}} as estradiol 17β-phenylpropionate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen. It is the phenylpropionate ester of estradiol. EPP is marketed in combination with estradiol benzoate under the brand name Dimenformon Prolongatum in the Netherlands and in combination with estradiol <b>benzoate,</b> <b>testosterone</b> propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, and testosterone isocaproate under the brand name Mixogen (a balanced mixture of estradiol and testosterone esters).http://home.intekom.com/pharm/donmed/mixogen.html Both of these drug combinations are long-acting injectables indicated in hormone replacement therapy for women in menopause. Dimenformon Prolongatum has also been investigated as a single injection, [...] "morning after" [...] post-coital contraceptive, and is additionally used {{as a component of}} hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|R
40|$|Oestradiol <b>benzoate,</b> <b>testosterone</b> propionate, progesterone, corticosterone, 3 -methylcholanthrene and {{phenobarbital}} {{were administered}} to Wistar rats at the pubertal period, and their effects on hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities were determined. Pretreatment with oestradiol benzoate had a temporary suppressive effect on androsterone UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in rats with the high-activity phenotype of androsterone glucuronidation. The effect was marked in 40 -day-old rats, but was not found in older rats. Androsterone UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was induced by phenobarbital in rats with the high-activity phenotype, but not in rats with the low-activity phenotype. Foster-feeding experiments showed that breast milk did not alter the genetically determined expression of androsterone UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in Wistar rats. In contrast, 4 -nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was not affected by steroid hormones, but was highly induced by 3 -methylcholanthrene...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In adulthood, male rats express {{higher levels}} of {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) than do female rats. We tested whether this sex difference is primarily {{due to differences in}} neonatal levels of testosterone. Male and female rats were gonadectomized on the day of birth and treated with testosterone propionate (TP) or vehicle on postnatal days 1, 3, and 5 (P 1, P 3, and P 5). Three months later, all rats were implanted with testosterone-filled capsules. Two weeks later, brains were processed for in situ hybridization to detect AVP mRNA. We found that neonatal TP treatment significantly increased the number of vasopressinergic cells in the BST over control injections. We then sought {{to determine the effects of}} testosterone metabolites, estradiol and dihydrotestosterone, given alone or in combination, on AVP expression in the BST. Rat pups were treated as described above, except that instead of <b>testosterone,</b> estradiol <b>benzoate</b> (EB), dihydrotestosterone propionate (DHTP), a combination of EB and DHTP (EB�DHTP), or vehicle was injected neonatally. Neonatal treatment with either EB or EB�DHTP increased the number of vasopressinergic cells in the BST over that of DHTP or oil treatment. However, treatment with DHTP also significantly increased the number of vasopressinergic cells over that of oil treatment. Hence, in addition to bolstering evidence that estradiol is the more potent metabolite of testosterone in causing sexual differentiation of the brain, these data provide the first example of a masculinizing effect of a nonaromatizable androgen on a sexually dimorphic neuropeptide system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} the applicability of a yeast androgen and estrogen bioassay in the detection of steroid esters in hair samples of animals treated with a hormone ester cocktail. The outcome of the activity screenings was critically compared with the results previously obtained with LC-MS/MS analysis. Hair samples of one pour-on treated animal, 10 ml DMSO containing 25 mg estradiol benzoate (EB), 60 mg testosterone decanoate (TD) and 60 mg testosterone cypionate (TC), were selected and analyzed with the androgen and estrogen yeast bioassay. Results showed that by the introduction of a hydrolysis step, bioassays can be used to screen for the presence of hormone esters in hair samples. Based on the difference in fluorescence responses between the nonhydrolyzed and the hydrolyzed hair samples, it was possible to detect the presence of EB up to at least 56 days after a single pour-on treatment and to detect the presence of TC and TD up to at least 14 days after the treatment. Although the LC-MS/MS analysis could detect TC and TD up to 49 days after treatment, bioassays have the advantage that they can also detect any (un) known steroid ester.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of in vitro treatment with <b>testosterone</b> propionate, estradiol <b>benzoate,</b> luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone on respiration, glucose uptake, and lactic acid accumulation by testis tissue from normal and cryptorchid rats. The tissues were incubated at 33. 5 C (testis temper-ature) and 37. 5 C (body temperature) in a modified Locke’s solution containing 5. 5 x 1 O a & glucose. The in vitro oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and glucose uptake of 2 - and 8 -day cryptorchid testis tissues were about 50 % lower than those of normal testis tissue. Lactic acid accumulation of the cryptorchid testicular tissues was not significantly different from that of normal testis tissue. In vitro treatment with testosterone propionate and luteinizing hormone depressed significantly all the metabolic parameters studied, whereas estradiol benzoate and follicle-stimulating hormone (in low concentrations) stimulated the oxidative metabolic activity of both normal and cryptorchid testis tissues. No consistent temperature effects were noted in the experiments with the various hormones. Although the hormonal status of the cryp-torchid mammal is not precisely known at present, there is evidence in the literature which suggests that changes occur in the out-put of gonadal and gonadotrophic hormones. Scrotal insulation in rams was found to increase seminal fructose, suggesting an in-crease in testosterone production (Glover, 1956). Hanes and Hooker (1937) reported that cryptorchid swine testis contained less “male ” hormone than normal swine testis. Engberg (1949) found markedly depressed urinary I 7 -ketosteroids in cryptorchid boys, men, and mature rabbits. Skinner and Row-son (1967) showed that the absolute andro-gen content of cryptorchid ram, stallion, and bull testes was drastically reduced.
