5|$|USB {{runs with}} a 5V power line, while FireWire in current {{implementations}} supplies 12V and <b>theoretically</b> can supply up to 30V.|$|E
5|$|While Carson {{led the way}} <b>theoretically,</b> Zobel was {{involved}} in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} {{drawings}} and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined {{at both the}} hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is <b>theoretically</b> possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.|$|E
5|$|In general, most field events allow a {{competitor}} {{to take their}} attempt individually, under <b>theoretically</b> the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance.|$|E
5|$|Neutrons {{from the}} fission of {{uranium-235}} are captured by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form neptunium-239 (half-life 2.36days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239. Egon Bretscher {{working on the}} British Tube Alloys project predicted this reaction <b>theoretically</b> in 1940.|$|E
5|$|People giving or {{receiving}} tattoos, piercings, and scarification are <b>theoretically</b> at risk {{of infection}} but no confirmed cases have been documented. It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV.|$|E
5|$|Riding on a {{treadmill}} is <b>theoretically</b> identical to riding on stationary pavement, and physical testing has confirmed this. Treadmills have been developed specifically for indoor bicycle training. Riding on rollers is still under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Sands {{went to the}} California Institute of Technology (Caltech), {{where he}} helped build and operate a 1.5 GeV {{electron}} synchrotron. He {{was the first to}} demonstrate, both <b>theoretically</b> and experimentally, the role of quantum effects in electron particle accelerators. He also studied beam instabilities, wake fields, beam-cavity interactions, and other phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The Huggins tables {{have not}} been officially tested, but are more {{conservative}} than the 1956 US Navy tables. They have been calculated from limits which would <b>theoretically</b> produce venous bubbles 10 to 20% of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakthrough}} with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory. They realised that a {{slow neutron}} reactor fuelled with uranium would <b>theoretically</b> produce {{substantial amounts of}} plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because uranium-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short-lived new isotope, uranium-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed <b>theoretically</b> feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissile—readily fissioned by both slow and fast neutrons, with the added advantage of being different from uranium, and therefore could be chemically separated from it. Bretscher even devised a chemical method to separate.|$|E
5|$|The main use {{of uranium}} in the {{civilian}} sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can <b>theoretically</b> produce about 20terajoules of energy (2joules), assuming complete fission; {{as much energy as}} 1500 tonnes of coal.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{would be}} {{vulnerable}} to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as comets, meteoroids, and material in interstellar space that is currently being deflected by the Sun's bow shock. The heliosphere, and any protection it <b>theoretically</b> provides, would cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|<b>Theoretically,</b> {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies <b>theoretically</b> held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, <b>theoretically,</b> ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a <b>theoretically</b> no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|Binary {{systems of}} sub-brown dwarfs are <b>theoretically</b> possible; Oph 162225-240515 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was <b>theoretically</b> predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could <b>theoretically</b> be used to recreate the virus. The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Dark {{energy in}} its {{simplest}} formulation {{takes the form}} of the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and <b>theoretically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could <b>theoretically</b> restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would <b>theoretically</b> prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and <b>theoretically.</b> Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption {{is a series of}} sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741nm {{is the most}} prominent and important.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} iron {{consists of}} four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe, 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.282% of 58Fe. Of these stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a nuclear spin (−). The nuclide 54Fe <b>theoretically</b> can undergo double electron capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's judiciary, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts. Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence. This <b>theoretically</b> allows the judiciary to interpret the law {{based solely on the}} legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown <b>theoretically</b> that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road {{undulations}} can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. <b>Theoretically</b> the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|The Gideon Gono {{series of}} 2004 carried the {{signature}} of the incumbent Reserve Bank governor, Dr. Gideon Gono and consisted of only one denomination of the first dollar ($500). This was the last series of regular banknotes of the first dollar, as hyperinflation forced all regular banknotes series out of use, although remaining legal tender <b>theoretically</b> until 21 August 2006.|$|E
5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; <b>theoretically,</b> other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|The US women's 4 x 400 metres {{relay team}} was {{recommended}} by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to be stripped of their gold medal, after the suspension of Crystal Cox for doping. The gold medal should <b>theoretically</b> go to Russia, silver to Jamaica and bronze to Great Britain. However, up to today, no further action has been taken by IOC. Hence, the US relay team is still listed as the winner for this event.|$|E
5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although <b>theoretically</b> staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album through his own label, Boxcar Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was <b>theoretically</b> able to retain the profits from the album. Having Fun with Elvis on Stage was first {{distributed}} at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, <b>theoretically</b> allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may <b>theoretically</b> spend {{at a given}} depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay at a given depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} the stem denoted the animal {{from which the}} antibody was obtained. The first monoclonal antibodies were produced in mice (substem -o-, yielding the ending -omab; usually Mus musculus, the house mouse) or other non-human organisms. Neither INN nor USAN has ever been requested for antibodies from rats (<b>theoretically</b> -a-), hamsters (-e-) and primates (-i-).|$|E
5|$|<b>Theoretically,</b> any gas giant {{could be}} {{enclosed}} in a solid shell; {{at a certain}} radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy {{could be provided by}} tapping the thermal energy of the planet. This concept is explored peripherally in the novel Accelerando (and the short story Curator, which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by Charles Stross, in which Saturn is converted into a human-habitable world.|$|E
