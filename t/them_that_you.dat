Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> messed with at your peril."

[...] Kaczynski additionally states that [...] "a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists", as in his view [...] "eftism is {{in the long run}} inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology". He also criticizes conservatives, describing them as [...] "fools" [...] who [...] "whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth.

2500|$|Shrimpton {{believes}} that the apparent indifference of earlier authors {{was due to the}} general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech On the Navy (354 BC): [...] "It is difficult to speak to you about , because you have such a hearty dislike of <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true." ...|$|E

He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E

The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet lishenets in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine Chudak. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where [...] the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror).

He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn.

Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.
