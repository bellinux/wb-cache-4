500|$|According to Lee, {{the album}} was fun {{but not in a}} [...] "poppy way" [...] and the band enjoyed its recording.

There's always one big relationship on a record that I sing about <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>I</b> feel like my big relationship on this album [...] with Evanescence itself, and with the fans. I think lyrically you're hearing a lot about a relationship, a struggle with a relationship or love in a relationship, and mostly I'm singing about that." ...|$|E

500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I believe God intended me to come here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>I</b> can do for my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>I</b> wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon {{was listed}} on the Gallup Organization's top-ten list of the most admired women {{fourteen}} times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was third in 1969, and remained at number two until 1972, when she was ranked number one as the most admired woman. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she {{was seen as an}} example of the [...] "American Dream," [...] having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the [...] "great silent majority" [...] of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the United States Mint and a long-time friend of Pat's, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as [...] "a good example to the women of this countryif they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups." [...] Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent Helen Thomas that Pat [...] "was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>I</b> think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I {{think we have a}} very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly not in the same template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>I</b> could say about it, what's in my head, and I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E

2500|$|Paxton {{decided to}} try some more {{elaborate}} recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, {{as well as his}} acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. [...] Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with The Things I Notice Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. [...] His song [...] "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. [...] The diverse [...] "Baroque Folk" [...] experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. [...] Regarding this time, he said, [...] "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved <b>the</b> <b>most...</b> <b>I</b> know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. [...] I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. [...] And I just wanted to hear folk songs." [...] Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>I</b> would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
