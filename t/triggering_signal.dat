When using with Cactus V6, both power output and zoom level of the RF60 can be adjusted remotely.|$|E
50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal,</b> the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no <b>triggering</b> <b>signal,</b> the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, Robert Moog created one of {{the first}} modular voltage-controlled music synthesizers, and {{demonstrated}} it at the AES convention that year. Moog employed his theremin company to manufacture and market his synthesizers which, unlike the synthesizers created by Don Buchla (the other prominent figure in the early history of the synthesizer), featured a piano-style keyboard as {{a significant portion of the}} user interface. Moog also established standards for analog synthesizer control interfacing, with a logarithmic one volt-per-octave pitch control and a separate pulse <b>triggering</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Famous modular {{synthesizer}} manufacturers included Buchla & Associates, Moog Music, ARP Instruments, Inc., and Electronic Music Studios. Moog established standards recognized worldwide {{for control}} interfacing on analog synthesizers, using an exponential 1-volt-per-octave pitch control {{and a separate}} pulse <b>triggering</b> <b>signal.</b> These control signals were routed using {{the same types of}} connectors and cables that were used for routing the synthesized sound signals. A specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder, based on equipment developed for speech synthesis. Vocoders are often used to make a sound that resembles a musical instrument talking or singing.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s synthesizers {{were still}} usually {{confined}} to studios {{due to their}} size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device. Harald Bode, Don Buchla, Hugh Le Caine, Raymond Scott and Paul Ketoff {{were among the first}} to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Buchla later produced a commercial modular synthesizer, the Buchla Music Easel. [...] Robert Moog, who had been a student of Peter Mauzey and one of the RCA Mark II engineers, created a synthesizer that could reasonably be used by musicians, designing the circuits while he was at Columbia-Princeton. The Moog synthesizer was first displayed at the Audio Engineering Society convention in 1964. It required experience to set up sounds but was smaller and more intuitive than what had come before, less like a machine and more like a musical instrument. Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate <b>triggering</b> <b>signal.</b> This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a music sequencer producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included ARP, who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm EMS.|$|E
40|$|This paper propose {{an optical}} {{structure}} to generate <b>trigger</b> <b>signals</b> for {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) using backward light which is usually disposed. The backward light is called backward amplified stimulated emission generated from semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) when using swept wavelength tunable laser (SWTL). A circulator is applied to block undesirable lights in the SWTL instead of an isolator in common SWTL. The circulator also diverts backward amplified spontaneous lights, which finally bring out <b>trigger</b> <b>signals</b> for a high speed digitizer. The spectra of the forward lights at SOA and the waveform of the backward lights were measured to check the procedure of the trigger formation in the experiment.

40|$|Pancreatic beta cells, which {{synthesize}} and secrete insulin, work as fuel-sensors. They {{adapt the}} rate of insulin secretion to the variations in plasma levels of glucose and ether nutrients. The stimulatory effect of glucose requires metabolism of the sugar by beta cells to generate both triggering and amplifying signals. The closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, probably mediated by an elevation in the ATP/ABP ratio in the cytoplasm, leads to membrane depolarization. The subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels during bursts of action potentials produces an intermittent Ca 2 + influx that causes an oscillatory rise of cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. This <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> entrains synchronous oscillations of insulin secretion. In addition, glucose increases the effectiveness of Ca 2 + on the secretory machinery. The nature of this amplifying signal is still unclear, but adenine nucleotides might also be involved. Hierarchically, {{the control of the}} membrane potential by glucose metabolism is the most important site of regulation, because it modulates the production of the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal,</b> whereas the second site only serves to amplify the response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{used the}} forward fall {{paradigm}} to test two hypotheses namely, that a supraspinal long-loop neural pathway {{is involved in}} the compensatory response, and secondly that the neural circuits underlying the performance of a balance-challenging task that requires the sequencing of several motor programs (compensatory reactions and stepping to recover balance) matures late in childhood. The first hypothesis was supported by the findings that the responses occurred earlier when the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> was moved from the abdominal up to the chest level. The time required to react to the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> within the supraspinal structures was also longer in children. The second hypothesis was verified by the observation of persisting soleus-tibialis coactivation in children up to 14 years old in three experimental conditions: unexpected release of the fall, voluntary release of the fall and longitudinal testing. These results suggest that the central processes involved in sequencing the postural responses do not mature until mid-adolescence. The maturation continues throughout childhood, with progressive emphasis on the central long- rather than short-latency pathways...|$|E
40|$|Preincubation of {{resident}} peritoneal macrophages with 10 - 100 ng/ml LPS for 60 min {{resulted in}} the cells becoming primed for enhanced (three-to eightfold higher) arachidonic acid (20 : 4) secretion {{in response to a}} variety of triggers. The half-maximal concentration of LPS required for priming was 10 ng/ml irrespective of whether the trigger was particulate (examples: zymosan or immune complexes) or soluble (such as PMA or A 23187). Similarly, the time required for half-maximal priming of macrophages was 20 min irrespective of which trigger was used. The primed state persisted for at least 30 h. LPS-priming of macrophages also affected the kinetics of 20 : 4 metabolite secretion. The lag phase characteristically observed when 20 : 4 secretion is triggered was reduced in LPS-primed cells. Furthermore, LPS-primed cells secreted 20 : 4 metabolites when challenged with latex beads, while unprimed cells did not. These data suggest that stimuli such as zymosan, which elicit 20 : 4 secretion in macrophages, promote two signals, a priming signal and a <b>triggering</b> <b>signal.</b> LPS is capable of establishing the priming signal but not the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal,</b> while latex promotes the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> but is unable to prime the cells for 20 : 4 release. LPS did not effect the profile of 20 : 4 metabolites secreted in response to any of the triggers, nor did it effect the profile of products synthesized from exogenously added 20 : 4, suggesting that it did not regulate the 20 : 4 cascade at the level of either the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways. Macrophages respond to LPS without the intervention of T lymphocytes, since the macrophages from nude mice could be primed for enhanced 20 : 4 secretion...|$|E

40|$|Physiologically, insulin {{secretion}} {{is subject}} to a dual, hierarchal control by triggering and amplifying pathways. By closing ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) in the plasma membrane, glucose and other metabolized nutrients depolarize beta-cells, stimulate Ca 2 + influx, and increase the cytosolic concentration of free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i), which constitutes the indispensable <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> to induce exocytosis of insulin granules. The increase in beta-cell metabolism also generates amplifying signals that augment the efficacy of Ca 2 + on the exocytotic machinery. Stimulatory hormones and neurotransmitters modestly increase the <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> and strongly activate amplifying pathways biochemically distinct from that set into operation by nutrients. Many drugs can increase insulin secretion in vitro, but only few have a therapeutic potential. This review identifies six major pathways or sites of stimulus-secretion coupling that could be aimed by potential insulin-secreting drugs and describes several strategies to reach these targets. It also discusses whether these perspectives are realistic or theoretical only. These six possible beta-cell targets are 1) stimulation of metabolism, 2) increase of [Ca 2 +]i by closure of K+ ATP channels, 3) increase of [Ca 2 +]i by other means, 4) stimulation of amplifying pathways, 5) action on membrane receptors, and 6) action on nuclear receptors. The theoretical risk of inappropriate insulin secretion and, hence, of hypoglycemia linked to these different approaches is also envisaged...|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{secretion}} from pancreatic B-cells is {{tightly controlled}} by {{variations in the}} plasma concentration of nutrients, in particular glucose. Glucose does not bind to a receptor, but must be metabolized by B-cells to influence {{the function of the}} latter. A rise of the ATP/ADP ratio in the cytoplasm closes K(+) -ATP channels in the plasma membrane. This causes depolarization with intermittent opening of Ca 2 + channels and generation of a triggering signal: oscillations in the concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca 2 +. Glucose metabolism also generates a yet unidentified amplifying signal, that augments the efficacy of Ca 2 + on the machinery releasing insulin granules. The regulation of insulin secretion may thus be achieved through variations in the amplitude of the indispensable <b>triggering</b> <b>signal</b> or of the important, but insufficient, amplifying signal...|$|E
