2500|$|The low {{temperature}} difference means that water volumes {{must be very}} large to extract useful amounts of heat. [...] A 100MW power plant {{would be expected to}} pump on the order of 12 million gallons (44,400 metric tonnes) per minute. [...] For comparison, pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the Battleship Bismark, which weighed 41,700 metric tons, every minute. [...] This makes pumping a substantial parasitic drain on energy production in OTEC systems, with one Lockheed design consuming 19.55 MW in pumping costs for every 49.8 MW net electricity generated. [...] For OTEC schemes using heat exchangers, to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> plants, making them {{one of the most critical}} components due to their impact on overall efficiency. A 100 MW OTEC power plant would require 200 exchangers each larger than a 20-foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{standard}} semitransparent photovoltaic (PV) modules can largely replace architectural glass {{installed in}} the windows, skylights, and facade of a building.

Subsequently, the authors analyzed the influence of HISG structures on the optical, <b>thermal,</b> and <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> performance of the original semitransparent PV module {{and the degree to which}} enhanced performance is possible.

40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{and change}} affect electricity generation in several ways. Electricity generation is directly dependent on climate/weather parameters like wind (wind <b>power</b> <b>generation)</b> or air temperature and resulting water temperature (<b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants). River discharge {{as a result}} of precipitation and temperature, the latter being one main factor influencing evapotranspiration, is important for hydro <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> and cooling of <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants. In this study possible effects of climate variability and change on electricity generation in Germany are analyzed.

While hydro <b>power</b> plants and <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants are affected negatively due to declining river discharge or higher water temperatures, for wind <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> no clear tendency was found. The reduction for hydro <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> could be leveled out by a slight increase in installed capacity and modernization of turbines and generators. By a replacement of old once-through cooling systems by closed-circuit cooling systems for new <b>thermal</b> <b>power</b> plants the negative impacts on electricity generation can be reduced significantly.
