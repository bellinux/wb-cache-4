25|$|Desmond's story {{continues}} {{where it}} left off, in 2012. After escaping the Templars' attack {{at the end}} of Assassin's Creed II, Desmond Miles, Lucy Stillman, Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings flee to Monteriggioni, establishing a new hideout in the ruins of the Villa Auditore. After restoring the electricity in the old tunnels under the villa, the player once again takes control of Ezio Auditore through Desmond's genetic memory, using the Animus 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). Their mission is to find the Apple of Eden, an important and mysterious artifact that could prevent the impending disaster <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> in that same year, believed to be perpetrated by the Templars.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.|$|E

2500|$|When Rudd {{announced}} {{his intention to}} issue an apology, the Liberal Party split on the issue in 2008.

Former Liberal minister Judi Moylan said: [...] "I think as a nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't be thinking about it as an individual apology— it's an apology <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from the nation state because it was governments that did these things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Volume 1 {{focuses on}} the {{introduction}} of the characters of the story, marking the events that lead to their team formations. All the while, mysterious thefts of Dust are occurring around the city of Vale, notably organized by the show's antagonist, Roman Torchwick. Volume 2 follows up from these events of Volume 1, and team RWBY sets out in order to investigate the meaning behind these thefts. They aim to discover the villain's plans for the city of Vale before the Vytal Festival—a festival between the four kingdoms of Remnant where they have their best students demonstrate their skills and abilities in celebration of the peace between all four kingdoms. Volume 3 starts with the beginning of the Vytal Festival; however, a sinister plot lurks behind the celebratory events, and the heroes {{can only do so much}} to prepare for the evil <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming.</b> Volume 4 takes place six to eight months following the events of Volume 3, with the members of Team RWBY separated and in different parts of the globe, mainly trying to get to [...] "Mistral" [...] (another location in the series) where another Huntsman Academy is located, to prepare it for a new evil. Volume 5 follows the members of Team RWBY each making their way to Mistral, as well as picking themselves back up after recovering during the previous Volume.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial {{segment of the}} CanAm Highway. [...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route. [...] "The CanAm matters so little to Saskatchewan highway planners that they've turned the most southern part of it within the province -- the Highway 35 link from Weyburn to the little U.S. border crossing at Oungre -- to gravel. SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonorable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'. [...] "Brenda Bakken Lackey called Highway 35 an “embarrassment’’ and a hazard for truckers’ business since it {{was turned into a}} gravel roadway last year. [...] 'When it rains, there is mud and when it is dry, there is flying dust and gravel,' she said. 'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say {{they are not going to}} put up with the mud <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' [...] " [...] "The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely especially when it comes to emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken."
