40|$|SummaryNeural {{circuits}} in {{the brain}} often receive inputs from multiple sources, such as the bottom-up input from early processing stages and the top-down input from higher-order areas. Here we study the function of top-down input in the mouse superior colliculus (SC), which receives convergent inputs from the retina and visual cortex. Neurons in the superficial SC display robust responses and speed tuning to looming stimuli <b>that</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>approaching</b> objects. The looming-evoked responses are reduced by almost half when the visual cortex is optogenetically silenced in awake, but not in anesthetized, mice. Silencing the cortex {{does not change the}} looming speed tuning of SC neurons, or the response time course, except at the lowest tested speed. Furthermore, the regulation of SC responses by the corticotectal input is organized retinotopically. This effect we revealed may thus provide a potential substrate for the cortex, an evolutionarily new structure, to modulate SC-mediated visual behaviors...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} area for future {{studies in the}} iPSC field is directly testing iPSC tumorigenicity using methods <b>that</b> <b>mimic</b> the <b>approaches</b> <b>that</b> {{would be used for}} regenerative medicine therapies. Such studies are crucial since iPSCs not only form teratoma, but also mice derived from iPSCs have a high incidence of death from malignant cancer. A 2010 paper was published in the journal Stem Cells indicating that iPS cells are far more tumorigenic than ESC, supporting the notion that iPS cell safety is a serious concern.|$|R

Furthermore, we claim through an example that flatness is not a sufficient condition to establish the absence of interactions in the underlying microscopic model of a thermodynamic system, which poses a limitation on the usefulness of Ruppeiner’s metric and conjecture. Finally, we {{address the problem of}} the choice of coordinates in black hole thermodynamics. We propose an alternative energy representation for Kerr-Newman black holes <b>that</b> <b>mimics</b> fully Weinhold’s <b>approach.</b> The corresponding Ruppeiner’s metrics become degenerate only at absolute zero and have non-vanishing scalar curvatures...|$|R
40|$|The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), {{is perhaps}} the most {{successful}} invasive mosquito species in contemporary history. In the United States, Ae. albopictus has spread from its introduction point in southern Texas to as far north as New Jersey (i. e., a span of approximate to 14 degrees latitude). This species experiences seasonal constraints in activity because of cold temperatures in winter in the northern United States, but is active year-round in the south. We performed a laboratory experiment to examine how life-history traits of Ae. albopictus from four populations (New Jersey [39. 4 degrees N], Virginia [38. 6 degrees N], North Carolina [35. 8 degrees N], Florida [27. 6 degrees N]) responded to photoperiod conditions <b>that</b> <b>mimic</b> <b>approaching</b> winter in the north (short static daylength, short diminishing daylength) or relatively benign summer conditions in the south (long daylength), at low and high larval densities. Individuals from northern locations were predicted to exhibit reduced development times and to emerge smaller as adults under short daylength, but be larger and take longer to develop under long daylength. Life-history traits of southern populations were predicted to show less plasticity in response to daylength because of low probability of seasonal mortality in those areas. Males and females responded strongly to photoperiod regardless of geographic location, being generally larger but taking longer to develop under the long daylength compared with short day lengths; adults of both sexes were smaller when reared at low larval densities. Adults also differed in mass and development time among locations, although this effect was independent of density and photoperiod in females but interacted with density in males. Differences between male and female mass and development times was greater in the long photoperiod suggesting differences between the sexes in their reaction to different photoperiods. This work suggests that Ae. albopictus exhibits sex-specific phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits matching variation in important environmental variables...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{empirical}} research strategies/possibilities of complex economic systems. On the one side economics theory {{is more and more}} opening to the ones of social sciences; on the other side, the empirical procedures used are much less often to adapt empirical methods of other social disciplines. Hence an opening towards social sciences can help the economic profession to develop more efficient and broader empirical methodologies to empirically analyse complex phenomenon of an economic system like the shadow economy. We review the literature and estimation procedure on one special case of structural equation modelling, the Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model. This bearing in mind the lack of other reliable methods, we conclude <b>that</b> the (DY-) <b>MIMIC</b> <b>approach</b> {{is one of the best}} approaches to analyse the shadow economy, and is a good example of the advantages derived by an open-mindedness and multidisciplinary approach desirable for the economic research...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} new “neuromorphic computing” {{architectures}} <b>that</b> <b>mimic</b> the brain’s <b>approach</b> to simultaneous processing and storage of information is intense. Because, in real brains, neuronal synapses outnumber neurons by many orders of magnitude, the realization of hardware devices mimicking the functionality of a synapse is a first and essential step in such a search. We report the development of such a hardware synapse, implemented entirely in the optical domain via a photonic integrated-circuit approach. Using purely optical means brings the benefits of ultrafast operation speed, virtually unlimited bandwidth, and no electrical interconnect power losses. Our synapse uses phase-change materials combined with integrated silicon nitride waveguides. Crucially, we can randomly set the synapticweight simply by varying the number of optical pulses sent down thewaveguide, delivering an incredibly simple yet powerful approach that heralds systems with a continuously variable synaptic plasticity resembling the true analog nature of biological synapses...|$|R
40|$|Non-uniform blind {{deblurring}} {{for general}} dynamic scenes is a challenging computer vision problem since blurs {{are caused by}} camera shake, scene depth as well as multiple object motions. To remove these complicated motion blurs, conventional energy optimization based methods rely on simple assumptions such that blur kernel is partially uniform or locally linear. Moreover, recent machine learning based methods also depend on synthetic blur datasets generated under these assumptions. This makes conventional deblurring methods fail to remove blurs where blur kernel is difficult to approximate or parameterize (e. g. object motion boundaries). In this work, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network that restores blurred images caused by various sources in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we present multi-scale loss function <b>that</b> <b>mimics</b> conventional coarse-to-fine <b>approaches.</b> Moreover, we propose a new large scale dataset that provides pairs of realistic blurry image and the corresponding ground truth sharp image that are obtained by a high-speed camera. With the proposed model trained on this dataset, we demonstrate empirically that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in dynamic scene deblurring not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} commerce {{has led to the}} creation of many new and interesting business models for Internet-based selling. In this paper, we will explore a variant of the typical dynamic pricing mechanism, in which buyers and sellers actively engage in the price discovery process, that emphasizes the power of group buying. Dynamic pricing approaches are used by many well known Internet-based firms, including firms that offer online auctions such as eBay and Amazon. com. A group-buying discount is a dynamic pricing mechanism <b>that</b> <b>mimics</b> the general <b>approach</b> of traditional “discount shopping clubs. ” Group buying pricing mechanisms permit buyers to aggregate their purchasing power and obtain lower prices than they otherwise would be able to get individually. However, with the recent closing of Mercata. com, a leading group-buying Web site, and the change in strategic direction of another market leader, Mobshop. com, the future of group-buying discount business models in Internet-based selling is no longer clear. In this essay, we will: (1) introduce the innovations associated with group-buying business models in Internet-based selling; (2) characterize the operational aspects of dynamic pricing mechanisms for group-buying through a discussion of a series of mini-cases with different firms that are widely recognized as the innovators in this area; (3) assess the quality of their business models relative to other new business models for Internet-based selling; and (4) dra...|$|R
