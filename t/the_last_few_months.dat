He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the United States Navy, was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam. He attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. {{at the start of the}} 1930s, before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II, briefly commanding two ships, the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815.

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced {{risk of breast cancer}} for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E

The division arrived in the area of Rijeka in mid-April 1945. However, by April 1945 the Croatian manpower of the division had been significantly reduced due to desertions or release.

5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E

During the German Spring Offensive, launched in March 1918, he was made acting battalion commander. In September 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. He participated in the last offensive action of the war involving the New Zealand Division when on 4 November 1918, his battalion attacked Germans positioned in a fortified house in the Mormal Forest.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot.

As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it.

During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the war, it fought in northern Dalmatia and parts of Lika and Kordun and later in Banija. When the Partisans launched their spring offensive on 20 March 1945, it fought the Partisan 2nd Army as it advanced on Zagreb. The division withdrew from Gospić via Donji Lapac, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi and Kostajnica where most of its remaining Croatian soldiers were separated out from the German elements and probably dispersed. The remainder continued its withdrawal via Sunja, Sisak and Zagreb to Brežice in modern-day Slovenia, where it surrendered to the Partisans at the village of Raka on 10 May 1945, and the remaining Croat soldiers left the division. The division's disarmed German troops were allowed to travel towards Germany for several days before becoming prisoners of war of the Partisans. Gravenstein was tried by the Yugoslav authorities in 1947 and hanged.|$|E
25|$|With {{no income}} {{and outside of}} the law, Giuliano turned to banditry, and later {{extortion}} and kidnapping. His exclusive target was the wealthy, partly from identification with poor peasants, but mostly for efficiency—the rich had more money. Thanks to Sicily's omerta tradition, local peasants were reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement, and Giuliano made them his allies and effective co-conspirators. Throughout his career he paid up to ten times the going market rate for his supplies to the locals. They became good sources of intelligence about rich targets for his crimes, as well as law enforcement activity. While Giuliano's core band was never larger than 20 men, peasants from Montelepre and nearby Giardinello would join him in the mountains temporarily for the excellent pay the bandit offered.

5|$|With an {{interest}} in pathology, Stansfield spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{of his time in}} Edinburgh working at the Royal Infirmary. In 1889, the London County Council (LCC) was established and took over the running of several London mental asylums; in the process, it advertised for a Fourth Assistant Medical Officer and Pathologist at Banstead Asylum, essentially a junior assistant with pathological duties which often related to postmortems. Stansfield successfully applied for the position. While at Banstead, he became interested in the pathology of mental illness and asylum administration. Accustomed to the laboratories at Edinburgh and drilled in rigorous note-taking skills, he set about instilling similar facilities and ethos at Banstead under the auspices of its superintendent, Dr T. Claye Shaw. Each ward would also have its own fixed notebook for medical officers, a practice which over time spread to all other asylums in the country. Thanks to this and his enjoying good relations with its steward, F. Alderton, Stansfield was made Banstead's Second Assistant Medical Officer in 1890 and, when Claybury Asylum opened in 1892–93, he was transferred there as First Assistant Medical Officer, helped by Claye Shaw's influence at the LCC. Over the course of the 1890s, he visited numerous domestic and foreign institutions, travelling to Germany and the United States.|$|E

During this period, the activities of the division primarily involved airborne training, as well as taking part in several training exercises.

By <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of 1943 the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had conducted airborne exercises and finished their training, and had then been transferred to Europe; to ensure the divisions could conduct airborne operations, a majority of the transport aircraft available in the United States had been sent with them, and even more were transferred to Europe as replacements after the American airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. Consequently, very few transport aircraft were available for use by the 13th, and the original training exercise for the division that had been scheduled for June 1944 had to be postponed until 17 September, and then once again until 24 September.|$|E
