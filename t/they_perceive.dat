5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} {{workers and}} their supporters, including activists and employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting what <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as discriminatory treatment {{on the part of}} the Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose what <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
