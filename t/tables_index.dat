Application specific SoC design presents the prospects for incorporating custom NoC architectures that are more suitable for a specific application, and may not be suitable for regular topologies. The precise but often different communication requirements among IP-cores of the SoC call for the design of application-specific topology of SoC for better performance with respect to communication energy, latency, and throughput. In the presented work, a methodology for the design of customized irregular topology for SoC with complex communication behavior is proposed. The proposed methodology uses the aforementioned knowledge of the application’s communication attribute to produce an power optimized network and corresponding routing <b>tables.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — SoC, on-chip networks, application specifi...|$|E

40|$|In quantum coding theory, {{stabilizer}} {{codes are}} probably the most important class of quantum codes. They are regarded as the quantum analogue of the classical linear codes and the properties of stabilizer codes have been carefully studied in the literature. In this paper, a new but simple construction of stabilizer codes is proposed based on syndrome assignment by classical parity-check matrices. This method reduces the construction of quantum stabilizer codes to the construction of classical parity-check matrices that satisfy a specific commutative condition. The quantum stabilizer codes from this construction have a larger set of correctable error operators than expected. Its (asymptotic) coding efficiency is comparable to that of CSS codes. A class of quantum Reed-Muller codes is constructed, which have a larger set of correctable error operators than that of the quantum Reed-Muller codes developed previously in the literature. Quantum stabilizer codes inspired by classical quadratic residue codes are also constructed and some of which are optimal in terms of their coding parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{increasing}} multicast applications and high desire for its deployment, it seems that any new technology should support multicast. However, Mpls (Multiprotocol Label Switching) technology which enhances IP packet forwarding capability by using layer 2 switching still does not offer any special solution for multicast support. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for multicast over Mpls. We separate labels for unicast and multicast traffic. Our method use one label for each multicast tree. Therefore, consumes fewer labels compared to existing proposals and has smaller forwarding <b>tables.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—MPLS, MPLS Multicast, Multicast, Multicast over MPLS. common between multicast and unicast traffics. As a result, the label assignment process to the multicast traffic is not a trivial task currently. Besides, for each multicast tree branch, an output label must be stored in MFT of an LSR which consumes invaluable memory and label. In contrast, our architecture uses a unique label to identify a multicast tree. Therefore, we store only one entry for each multicast tree in MT (Multicast Table) of an LSR that considerably reduces the MT size. By using this scheme {{there is no need}} to label swapping. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the related works. Then, our method is explained in section 3. Finally, we conclude the paper in section 5. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—High-performance routers require {{high-speed}} IP address lookup {{to achieve}} wire-speed packet forwarding. This study proposes a new data structure, the Multi-Index Hybrid Trie (MIHT), for dynamic router table designs. This data structure was constructed {{by combining the}} useful characteristics of the B+ tree and priority trie. IP lookup operations can be performed efficiently by associating each prefix with a key value in the MIHT. Furthermore, because the required tree height and number of prefixes were reduced, dynamic router table operations were performed efficiently using the MIHT. To reduce the memory requirement, each prefix stored its corresponding suffix in a node of the MIHT, rather than storing a full prefix. Experiments using IPv 4 and IPv 6 routing databases indicated that the proposed data structure has efficient memory usage and performs well for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. This study reports {{the results of the}} experiments performed to compare the proposed data structure with other structures using the benchmark IPv 4 and IPv 6 prefix databases AS 1221, AS 4637, AS 6447, AS 65000, AS 1221 *, and AS 6447 * with 407, 067, 219, 581, 417, 995, 406, 973, 12, 155, and 12, 278 prefixes, respectively, where AS 1221 * and AS 6447 * are IPv 6 BGP routing <b>tables.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Classless inter domain routing (CIDR), dynamic router tables, IP address lookup, longest matching prefix, multi-index hybrid trie. ...|$|E
40|$|Pure Lucid {{programs}} are concurrent with very fine granularity. Sequential Threads (STs) are functions introduced {{to enlarge the}} grain size; they are passed from server to workers by Communication Procedures (CPs) in the General Intensional Programming System (GIPSY). A JLucid program combines Java code for the STs with Lucid code for parallel control. Thus first, in this thesis, we describe {{the way in which}} the new JLucid compiler generates STs and CPs. JLucid also introduces array support. Further exploration goes through the additional transformations that the Lucid family of languages has undergone to enable the use of Java objects and their members, in the Generic Intensional Programming Language (GIPL), and Indexical Lucid: first, in the form of JLucid allowing the use of pseudo-objects, and then through the specifically-designed the Objective Lucid language. The syntax and semantic definitions of Objective Lucid and the meaning of Java objects within an intensional program are provided with discussions and examples. Finally, there are many useful scientific and utility routines written in many imperative programming languages other than Java, for example in C, C++, Fortran, Perl, etc. Therefore, it is wise to provide a framework to facilitate inclusion of these languages into the GIPSY and their use by Lucid programs. A General Imperative Compiler Framework and its concrete implementation is proposed to address this issue.

40|$|The query for triple {{information}} on product–attribute (property) –value {{is one of}} the most frequent queries in e-commerce. In storing the triple (product–attribute–value) information, a vertical schema is effective for avoiding sparse data and schema evolution, while a conventional horizontal schema often shows better query performance, since the properties are queried as groups clustered by each product. Therefore, we propose two storage schemas: a vertical schema as a primary table structure for the triple information in RDBMS and a pivoted <b>table</b> <b>index</b> created from the basic vertical table as an additional index structure for accelerating query processing. The pivoted <b>table</b> <b>index</b> is beneficial to improving the performance of the frequent pattern query on the group properties associated with each product class. </p...|$|R
40|$|The one of {{the most}} time {{consuming}} steps for association rule mining is the computation of the frequency of the occurrences of itemsets in the database. The hash <b>table</b> <b>index</b> approach converts a transaction database to an hash index tree by scanning the transaction database only once. Whenever user requests for any Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the request entry is stored in the Log File of the server. This paper presents the hash <b>index</b> <b>table</b> structure, a general and dense structure which provides web page set extraction from Log File of server. This hash table provides information about the original database. Web Page set mining (WPs-Mine) provides a complete representation of the original database. This approach works well for both sparse and dense data distributions. Web page set mining supported by hash <b>table</b> <b>index</b> shows the performance always comparable with and often better than algorithms accessing data on flat files. Incremental update is feasible without reaccessing the original transactional database...|$|R
50|$|A cursor is {{a logical}} pointer within a <b>table</b> <b>index.</b> The cursor may be {{positioned}} on a record, before the first record, after the last record or even between records. If a cursor is positioned before or after a record, there is no current record. It is possible to have multiple cursors into the same <b>table</b> <b>index.</b> Many record and column operations {{are based on the}} cursor position. Cursor position can be moved sequentially by Move operations or directly using index keys with Seek operations. Cursors can also be moved to a fractional position within an index. In this way, the cursor can be quickly moved to a thumb bar position. This operation is performed with the same speed as a Seek operation. No intervening data must be accessed.|$|R
