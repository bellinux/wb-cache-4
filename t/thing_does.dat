25|$|Evidence {{of absence}} is {{evidence}} of any kind {{that can be used}} to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any malignant cells in a patient this null result (finding nothing) {{is evidence of}} absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such inductive reasoning is important to empiricism and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to try to identify when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the <b>thing</b> <b>does</b> not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).|$|E

500|$|Striving {{to persevere}} {{is not merely}} {{something}} that a <b>thing</b> <b>does</b> {{in addition to other}} activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is [...] "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term conatus to refer to rudimentary concepts of inertia, as Descartes had earlier. Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.|$|E

This {{might suggest that}} al-Tabari considered kitab merely {{as a metaphor for}} Allah's knowledge. However, from al-Tabari's comments elsewhere on Allah's knowledge it is quite evident that he is not speaking metaphorically. For example, in 35.11 where the Qur'an states that the length or shortness of a person's life is in a kitab is explained by al-Tabari as [...] "it is in a kitab with Allah, written (maktab) which he computes and knows" [...] (XXII: 71-2).|$|E

2500|$|On 30 August, the OSCE's chairman-in-office, Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, {{met with}} Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. The ministers {{discussed}} among others the missile incident and Moratinos outlined {{the contents of}} the report prepared by his special envoy Žužul on meetings he had the week before in Moscow and Tbilisi. The report, which is not yet publicly available, will be presented by Žužul at the OSCE Permanent Council meeting in Vienna on 6 September. An OSCE spokesman said that [...] "the key point here is that it's not the OSCE's role to pass judgment, or point the finger. It's to listen to all sides, and to recommend and seek ways to avoid similar incidents and tensions in the future. So this is not about trying to establish who was responsible, or what exactly happened, but to look to the future to try to find ways to ensure that this kind of <b>thing</b> <b>does</b> not happen again." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's a kid with a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right <b>thing</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily mean that he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was {{standing in the middle of}} the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
