5|$|Another {{lookalike}} {{species is}} Suillus subaureus, {{which can be}} distinguished microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (<b>translucent)</b> spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3µm), and an association with Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides).|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{clouds are}} <b>translucent</b> {{and so have}} no opacity-based varieties; only one species is opaque, which is cirrus spissatus.|$|E
5|$|Crucibulum laeve has spores {{that are}} elliptical, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> and smooth, with {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 4–6µm.|$|E
5|$|LEGO fans could suggest {{improvements}} to the initial prototypes such as adding color to the roof (which was originally gray) and <b>translucent</b> elements to the hotel sign.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually <b>translucent,</b> and the <b>translucent</b> cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not <b>translucent</b> and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores of M.sextelata are {{elliptical}} and smooth, typically measuring 18–25 by 10–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> cylindrical, {{and measure}} 200–325 by 5–25µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical, septate, and measure 175–300 by 2–15µm. Their tips are variably shaped, from rounded, to club-shaped, to fuse-shaped. The {{contents of the}} paraphyses are hyaline (<b>translucent)</b> to faintly brownish in dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH). Hyphae on the sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 50–180 by 5–25µm. The terminal cells are variably shaped (similar to the paraphyses), and have brownish contents in KOH.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{elliptical}} or , smooth, <b>translucent</b> (hyaline), with {{dimensions of}} 4.5–5.5 by 2–2.5µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, {{are attached to}} 6–8 sessile spores.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt green, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Rinman's green or zinc green, is a <b>translucent</b> green pigment made by heating {{a mixture of}} cobalt (II) oxide and zinc oxide. Sven Rinman, a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.|$|E
5|$|FBI agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and {{his partner}} of five years, Robert Danzig (Joe Flanigan), are {{pursuing}} an arms dealer; while Lee apprehends the man, his partner is killed by a second, mysterious man with <b>translucent</b> skin and seemingly superhuman abilities. The skin of Danzig's body also becomes <b>translucent</b> after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing their intentions. Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about {{the appearance of the}} killer, but are unable to identify him by name.|$|E
5|$|In the post-War years, <b>translucent,</b> molded plastic, electrified, lit-from-within tree toppers in {{the shape}} of angels and stars became popular. Although Santa Claus and other Christmas icons were {{introduced}} as electrified toppers, the star and the angel of the Victorian era remained the preferred motif. Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.|$|E
5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside. Living specimens range in colour from <b>translucent</b> creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|P. labiata will {{sometimes}} approach a <b>translucent</b> nest containing another spider, and will usually wait facing the prey {{for up to}} several hours. Occasionally P. labiata leaps at the prey in the nest, but this is ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The copulatory bulb {{of males}} (the sperm-transferring organ {{at the tip}} of the pedipalps), terminates in a narrow, curving tip called an embolus, which in Unicorn bears a hook at its base and is {{accompanied}} by a similar curved extension called a <b>translucent</b> sclerite.|$|E
5|$|The diamond allotrope {{of carbon}} is clearly nonmetallic, being <b>translucent</b> {{and having a}} low {{electrical}} conductivity of 10−14 to 10−16S·cm−1. Graphite has an electrical conductivity of 3 × 104S·cm−1, a figure more characteristic of a metal. Phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviours.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 is {{compatible}} with iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013. However, some features are not supported. For example, like the iPhone 4, the Notification Center and the Control Center use the transparent style instead of the <b>translucent</b> style in later iOS models.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} stadium is the <b>translucent</b> outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects. Usually, red lighting is used for Bayern home games, blue for 1860 Munich games and white for German national team home games.|$|E
5|$|The red ground {{resulted}} in a warmth of tone that {{was picked up by}} the sensitive panchromatic film. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless <b>translucent</b> talcum. Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with <b>translucent</b> crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to <b>translucent,</b> and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> smooth, and have dimensions of 9–12 by 7–8µm. They are non-amyloid, {{meaning that they}} do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-producing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, measure 38–46 by 3–13µm, and have clamps at their bases.|$|E
5|$|The spores are cylindrical, smooth, and hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> with {{dimensions}} of 3–4 by 1–2µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, with {{dimensions of}} 20–25 by 3–4µm. They have eight sterigmata (slender extensions that {{attach to the}} spores), {{as well as a}} clamp at their base.|$|E
5|$|The spores are <b>translucent</b> (hyaline), roughly spherical, {{thin-walled}} and smooth, with {{dimensions of}} 6–8µm in diameter. The asci, the spore-bearing cells, are cylindrical and 80–100 by 7–8µm; the paraphyses are thin and filamentous and contain orange granules. Edibility {{has not been}} recorded for this fungus.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, {{about the}} same as a copper coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a <b>translucent</b> mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its specific gravity can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} dark brown spore print. The spores are smooth, broadly elliptical, and have dimensions of 6–7.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring 14–25 by 4–7μm; the sterigmata are 4–5μm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are broadly club-shaped to cylindrical, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> and measure 17–30 by 4–8μm.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or <b>translucent</b> third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|At 33 seconds a neon monster, {{with the}} 'SFA' logo on his chest, appears amongst the <b>translucent</b> buildings. More {{shots of the}} band and the {{computer}} generated city follow before the monster reappears during the second chorus, this time with electric bolts shooting from his body. As the track reaches its middle 8 a multicoloured neon spacecraft appears.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages {{has several}} {{features}} {{designed to help}} players complete puzzles. To recall clues or important items, players can use a camera feature to take screenshots, which are then placed in a journal the player can access at any time. Player interactions with other characters are similarly recalled via another journal; everything a character tells the player is stored and can be viewed at any time. Journal pages are narrated by {{the voice of the}} character, and missing pages of the journal appear <b>translucent</b> in menus.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum is {{classified}} in the family Bankeraceae, which was circumscribed by Marinus Anton Donk in 1961. The genus was not in Donk's original family concept, which included only Bankera and Phellodon, genera whose species produce hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> and ornamented spores. Donk left Hydnellum in the tribe Hydnelleae of the family Thelephoraceae, along with Sarcodon and Hydnodon. In 1981, however, Walter Jülich emended Donk's concept of the Bankeraceae, adding hydnoid genera that produced brown, lobed spores—Hydnellum and Sarcodon.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are bright {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are tightly packed {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are pale orange to {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are egg-shaped, measuring 20–24 by 14–16µm when mature, but smaller (14.5–19 by 9–10µm) in immature fruit bodies. They are thin-walled, hyaline (<b>translucent),</b> and inamyloid. The cylindrical asci (spore-bearing cells) are 300–360 by 16–20µm with walls up to 1.5µm thick. Paraphyses measure 90–184 by 10–18.5µm (6–9µm thick if immature); they are hyaline, have a septum at the base, and comprise either {{one or two}} cells. The flesh is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae measuring 3–9µm wide.|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth <b>translucent</b> surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost <b>translucent,</b> and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a glossy surface. Several {{internal}} organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell's outer surface. The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color, with different markings during distinct stages of development.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had <b>translucent</b> skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with <b>translucent</b> skin, watches from afar.|$|E
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on the underside of each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by <b>translucent,</b> pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, {{the author}} and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, <b>translucent</b> ceramics that {{could be classified as}} true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (<b>translucent).</b> Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
