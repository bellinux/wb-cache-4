The acorn weevils (Curculio spp.), larvae of moths (Valentinia glandulella and Melissopus latiferreanus), and gall forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.) feed on the acorns.|$|E
40|$|The black <b>timber</b> bark <b>beetle,</b> Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford 1894), is a {{new species}} for Romanian fauna and a {{potential}} invasive pest in our forests, orchards and vineyards, {{but there is little}} information about it in our scientific literature. Consequently, a short synthesis of the knowledge concerning the biology, ecology, damages, survey and control of the pest, is presented for the foresters, as well as for owners of orchards and vineyards. Preliminary data on its distribution and flight activity suggest that the pest may already be present in many zones of the country and that would have a generation per year...|$|R
50|$|Small pin-holes, {{caused by}} ambrosia beetles boring {{into the living}} trees, are a common and {{characteristic}} defect of Chengal. These small holes are often numerous, but although unsightly, they are only in exceptional cases sufficiently numerous to impair {{the strength of the}} <b>timber.</b> These ambrosia <b>beetles</b> die when the timber is seasoned and thus the damage is restricted almost entirely to that which occurs in the green timber. Big trees of Chengal are sometimes hollow at the centre and badly attacked by large borers, and occasional trees are seriously infected by a fungus (Fomes spp.), which initially gains entry through broken branches or other wounds and eventually reduces the timber to a dark pulpy condition. With the exception of pin holes, the timber of chengal is free from knots and other defects characteristic of sawn timber.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The study (1) {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} of P. nebulosus, (2) examines stimuli that may cause the beetles to locate brood material, and (3) establishes the relationship between moisture stress in Douglas-fir and colonization by P. nebuZosus. and other meristem insects. (1) Development of P. nebulosus goes through the egg stage, three larval instars, and the pupal and callow adult stages. Teneral adults emerge from late spring through fall, disperse, and feed in tissues of live Douglas-fir twigs before attaining sexual maturity. Progeny initiated in early spring may become capable of reproduction and initiate colonization of susceptible host material in fall. P. nebulosus overwinters in all stages except the egg and pupal stages, hibernating in feeding tunnels or galleries of newly colonized breeding sites. The main breeding period is the early spring. Females begin gallery construction. (2) The flight of immature beetles is governed by temperature, but is induced by light and appears primarily oriented toward light. Positive photic response appears to overpower response to vegetative stimuli. Temperature induces a reversal in the beetle's photic response at two thresholds (15. 5 °C and 34 °C). Decrease of light intensity to 17 f. c. induces a light negative and thigmotactic response. Two temperatures (19 °C and 34 °C) limit the range for flight take-off, which occurs only under conditions inducing positive phototropism in the beetle. Field tests failed to attract flying immature beetles to materials known as highly attractive to mature beetles. In laboratory tests, walking beetles responded to ethanol vapors in darkness but were unresponsive in the light. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the beetles alight into Douglas-fir crowns by chance and respond to feeding stimuli under condition-favoring negative phototaxis and thigmotaxis. The flight of mature P. nebulosus differs from the flight of immature beetles primarily in orientation. Field tests showed strong response by mature P. nebulosus to fresh Douglas-fir twigs and stem sections as well as to certain monoterpene solutions and ethanol. Ethanol was also attractive to Pseudohylesinus grandis Sw.; Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopk.; Hy 1 astes nigrinus (Mann); Gnathotriohus spp.; Trypodondron linoatum Oliver; and Anisandrus pyri (Peck). This suggests the possibility that ethanol is a constituent of primary host-attraction also to other scolytids besides <b>timber</b> <b>beetles</b> as suggested by others. The bimodal flight pattern of mature P. nebulosus and its possible causes are discussed. It is possible that trees under midday moisture deficits may become a temporary attraction source and 'absorb' part of the airborne population. (3) Diurnal and seasonal changes in moisture relations of Douglas-fir were determined by Scholander's pressure chamber technique of measuring plant moisture stress (PMS) in vascular plants. The ecological interpretation of PMS, determined at dawn and at midday, is discussed. The relationship between PMS in Douglas-fir and colonization by meristem insects was established by correlating the infestation status of a tree with its PMS (diurnal minimum) condition. PMS thresholds were found which indicate whether a host tree is in a condition (a) inducive; (b) tolerant, or (c) abortive to initial colonization by P. nebulosus, Scolytus unispinosus Lec., D. pseudotsugae (Scolytidae), and Melanophila drummondi Kirby (Buprestidae). These PMS thresholds appear specific for each insect species. The relation between the cardinal PMS condition in the insect-host relationship and other physiological parameters of the tree, such as photosynthetic activity, cell division, etc., are discussed. Only trees under PMS levels indicative of physiological condition with curtailed integrative processes become inducive to attacks by meristem insects. Ecological, silvical and entomological conclusions based on the obtained results may be important in forest management considerations regarding reduction of damage caused by bark beetles...|$|R
40|$|While the use {{of timber}} harvests is {{generally}} accepted as an effective approach to controlling bark beetles during outbreaks, in reality {{there has been a}} dearth of monitoring to assess outcomes, and failures are often not reported. Additionally, few studies have focused on how these treatments affect forest structure and function over the long term, or our forests’ ability to adapt to climate change. Despite this, there is a widespread belief in the policy arena that timber harvesting is an effective and necessary tool to address beetle infestations. That belief has led to numerous proposals for, and enactment of, significant changes in federal environmental laws to encourage more <b>timber</b> harvests for <b>beetle</b> control. In this review, we use mountain pine beetle as an exemplar to critically evaluate the state of science behind {{the use of}} timber harvest treatments for bark beetle suppression during outbreaks. It is our hope that this review will stimulate research to fill important gaps and to help guide the development of policy and management firmly based in science, and thus, more likely to aid in forest conservation, reduce financial waste, and bolster public trust in public agency decision-making and practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB) epidemic {{is a natural}} disturbance agent that is affecting the forest ecosystems in large portions of British Columbia. Affected ecosystems still provide {{for a variety of}} functions and services which include lumber production, clean water and habitat for plants and animals. However, the MPB is is impacting the capacity of the forest ecosystems to continue to provide for timber supply in the mid-term. In effect, the {{mountain pine}} beetle will result in significant decrease in timber supply. This decrease in timber supply will in turn have negative socio-economic effects on the forest industry and on forestry-dependent communities. As part of a project aimed at exploring opportunities to mitigate the projected decline in mid-term timber supply, analyses were undertaken in four timber supply areas (TSAs) : Williams Lake, Quesnel, Prince George and Lakes. For the Lakes TSA, these analyses forecast a mid-term harvest level of 0. 5 million cubic metres per year. The pre-mountain pine <b>beetle</b> <b>timber</b> supply projection for the mid-term (2020 to 2070) was 1. 5 million cubic metres per year and the current allowable annual cut is set at 2 million cubic metres per year. Mitigation opportunities explored as part of this project fall within two distinct categories: forest sector management practices and administration opportunities, and relaxation or deferral of objectives for non-timber forest values. While the technical working group solicited licensee input to evaluate potential opportunities, none other than those currently implemented (e. g. focusing harvest in pine and fertilization of young plantations under the LBIS) were identified under the forest sector management practices and administration category for the Lakes TSA. ...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean forest {{regions of}} Australia {{predominantly}} comprise native mallee scrub, eucalypt woodlands, exotic Pinus plantations, and commercial eucalypt plantations. Native forests have, so far, remained largely free of invasive exotic insects. The exotic pines, however, have five well-established and significant invasive pest insects: the bark beetles Ips grandicollis, Hylastes ater, and Hylurgus ligniperda (Coleoptera: Curculiondae), Monterey pine aphid, Essigella californica (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), {{with the latter}} not yet present in Western Australia (WA). The exotic giant pine scale, Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), was recently detected on pines in Adelaide and Melbourne and is under an eradication program. Many of the established pest species have had classical biological control programs implemented. European house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a pest of untreated softwood, is established in areas around Perth, WA, and {{has been found in}} dead and live trees, as well as untreated <b>timber.</b> African black <b>beetle,</b> Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a major exotic agricultural and forestry pest in wetter parts of the Mediterranean forest regions in WA, where it was first recorded in 1938. Several other exotic polyphagous horticultural pests are occasionally associated with eucalypts. Australia is the origin of major insect pests on Eucalyptus species grown in Mediterranean regions across the globe. However, populations of these insects are generally effectively controlled by native species of natural enemies in Australia. At least five species endemic to eastern Australia, Gonipterus platensis and G. sp. nov. 2, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Paropsisterna m-fuscum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Phylacteophaga froggatti (Hymenoptera: Pergidae) and Cardiapsina fiscella (Hempitera: Psyllidae), have been introduced to Mediterranean regions of WA, where they initially caused extensive and severe damage to plantations of introduced eucalypt species (predominantly E. globulus) in the region. However, the level and extent of damage gradually decreased, and it has been hypothesised that improved control by endemic natural enemies has occurred...|$|R
