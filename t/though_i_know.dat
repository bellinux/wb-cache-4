In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling."

500|$|Keith Fay of {{the folk}} metal band Cruachan has also noted the {{influence}} of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine Terrorizer, {{he said that there}} is [...] "no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand what real folk music is; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> this is not true for all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (<b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E

The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "I love this record—love it—even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> these boys flirt with images of {{brutality}} (Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio". In Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson described it as [...] "constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days." [...] Characterizing the band as [...] "authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood", he declared, [...] "It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives." [...] Newsdays Wayne Robbins simply anointed the Ramones as [...] "the best young rock 'n' roll band in the known universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|Southerners, however, {{saw that}} Douglas' attempt was {{unlikely}} to result in legalization of slavery. While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state, slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise {{as long as it}} remained a territory. If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution. Following this line of thought, Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise, the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30'. After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones, Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16, 1854. This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright, and two days later, he visited Dixon to discuss his position. Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise, but was ultimately convinced by Dixon's logic. He concluded the interview by exclaiming [...] "By God, Sir, you are right. I will incorporate it in my bill, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it will raise a hell of a storm." [...] Over the next several days, Douglas incorporated Dixon's suggestion and other pro-slavery measures into the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna {{has been}} a strong {{supporter}} of U.S. President Barack Obama. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience. [...] Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, [...] "I don't care who you vote for. [...] Do not take this great privilege for granted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemper {{gained some}} Internet fame in August 2007 {{for her part}} in [...] "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site Derrick Comedy. The video, which was {{circulated}} on the popular site CollegeHumor, was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform oral sex on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing. Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with The A.V. Club: [...] "I really don't like that video, and I wish that I hadn't done it, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that it's a joke. I hate that it got sort of big, because I don't think that it's that funny and I don't want {{that to be the}} epitome of my work. It's just one video in a sea of many, but it has made me conscious of not wanting to do a video like that again." [...] Kemper has also contributed an article to CollegeHumor entitled [...] "Regarding Our Decision Never to See Me Again." [...] She also had a minor role in the 2009 film Mystery Team. Kemper starred in the fake iPhone commercial on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in January 2007, six months before the first iPhone was released. Kemper appeared in the Sofia Coppola comedy-drama Somewhere in 2010. She appeared in Bridesmaids in 2011. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Kemper would be voicing a character in an episode of the animated sitcom American Dad!.|$|E

[...] In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying [...] "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog… who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her… Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" [...] Madonna went on to shout, [...] "Support education! Support the people who support women!"
