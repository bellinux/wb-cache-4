5|$|Despite {{the less}} {{enthusiastic}} response <b>The</b> <b>Flood</b> garnered than its predecessor, the book still sold well. Soon after release, <b>The</b> <b>Flood</b> made the Publishers Weekly top ten bestsellers paperback list. The next {{book in the}} series, , would be written by Eric Nylund and {{bridge the gap between}} Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred {{homes were}} {{inundated}} by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, {{but due to}} early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. The area affected by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. The long-term effects of <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> including {{its effect on the}} salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|The player's {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> in Halo: Combat Evolved {{is a major}} plot twist, {{and was one of}} the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in Halo2 and Halo3 was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> has varied over the years; while some found <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> too derivative and a clich√© element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to recruit Master Chief in {{retrieving}} the Index, {{a device that}} will activate Halo and prevent <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> a parasitic alien life form {{that appears in}} three main variants. Infection Forms, the true form of <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Battling <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the Forerunners {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able to hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>floods</b> {{killed at}} least four people in Kedah, {{including}} a foreign national. Around 50,000 people were evacuated, <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> even affecting <b>the</b> house of Kedah's Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak.

500|$|Farther south, flash {{flooding}} late on April 26 {{resulted in}} two fatalities in Monroe, Louisiana after {{an apartment complex}} was swamped. <b>The</b> <b>flooding</b> there {{was considered to be}} worse than <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> after Hurricane Gustav in 2008. In central and northern Arkansas, up to [...] of rain was reported during that week. <b>The</b> resulting flash <b>flooding</b> in central Arkansas also resulted in five people losing their lives.

5|$|By {{the events}} of Halo 3 (2007), <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> {{intelligence}} known as the Gravemind infests and captures High Charity, while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites follow Truth, and the Covenant Arbiter, or holy warrior, kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> controlled High Charity arrives at the Ark, the Arbiter and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the ring that the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> and sparing {{the rest of the}} galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in March 2553, and the Arbiter leads his Elites back to their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|For Halo 3, it {{was decided}} a new visual {{language}} for <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> was needed. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. With the addition of mutable forms in Halo 3, the only fictional constraint on the designer's imaginations was that <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> altered the DNA of its victims by digesting.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>floods</b> {{affected}} {{areas such as}} Aceh and North Sumatra, leaving many homeless. <b>The</b> <b>floods</b> lasted for a week starting on December 22.

5|$|In Tamil Nadu, {{partisan}} television channels {{associated with}} the ruling AIADMK and the opposing DMK political parties were criticised for using the disaster for their own political purposes. Also, several claimed that the political parties obstructed <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> relief efforts of the volunteers for their own gains. National media outlets were widely criticised on social media for failing to adequately report on <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> crisis. On 2 December, the government Press Information Bureau (PIB) released an edited photo showing the Prime Minister looking down from an aircraft window which was removed after criticism.|$|E

5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: <b>The</b> <b>Flood.</b> During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a {{last line of defense}} against an alien parasite called <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b> The Covenant accidentally release <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> which begins to spread across the ring. At the request of the installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b> However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving <b>the</b> <b>Flood</b> to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactor core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Flood</b> {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of <b>the</b> <b>Flood.</b> The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature <b>the</b> <b>Flood,</b> the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E

5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi.

He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podest√†) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinit√† bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinit√†. The Ponte Vecchio‚Äîsave the two central piers‚Äîwas swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> along the Arno.|$|E
