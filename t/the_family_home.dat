5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>home.</b> He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children.

On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>home</b> in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
