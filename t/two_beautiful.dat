5|$|High {{states that}} {{afterward}} Skaði {{went back up}} to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals with a bow, and lives in her fathers old house. Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised the {{functioning}} of the weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E

The king ordered him to be killed. Various attempts failed, but finally Christopher was beheaded.|$|E
25|$|The decline {{was halted}} in 1880 with the {{establishment}} of the Royal University of Ireland. The Royal Universities charter entitled all Irish students to sit the Universities examinations and receive its degrees.

25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{began with the}} game still finely balanced. Ponting put his trust in his two proven wicket takers – McGrath and Warne. England batted well for 40 minutes, with Vaughan taking the game to the Australian bowlers, but McGrath {{produced}} <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> outswingers to dismiss him and Ian Bell with consecutive deliveries. The Australian charge was diminished {{by a couple of}} uncharacteristic dropped catches, but Warne and McGrath combined to take 4 wickets before lunch, leaving England 133 runs ahead with five wickets remaining.|$|E
25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But her face is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E

On 1 January 1969, author Peter Doggett writes, Harrison arrived at Apple's central London headquarters in an [...] "exuberant" [...] mood, inspired by his recent music-making with Dylan and fellow Woodstock residents the Band, and [...] "enjoying the frisson of sharing his home with <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> women".|$|E

500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|The spirit {{though not}} the name of Brunette was briefly revived during 1945–46, when Larkin renewed his {{friendship}} with Amis. Among the stillborn projects planned by the pair was a story about <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> jazz-loving lesbian undergraduates. According to Booth, the [...] "feeble plot [...] merely the excuse for lesbian scenes... far indeed from the originality of Larkin's Brunette works of 1943". Jill, completed in 1944, was finally published in October 1946 by The Fortune Press, whose eccentric proprietor Reginald Caton reportedly accepted the book without reading it. Larkin was disappointed by the book's critical reception, but by this time his second novel, A Girl in Winter, had been accepted by Faber and Faber, and was duly published in February 1947. It received better reviews than Jill, and achieved moderately good sales; Booth calls it Larkin's [...] "most original and adventurous experiment in fiction". It is written {{from the viewpoint of}} its main female character, Katherine, but otherwise is unrelated to the Coleman phase. [...] Over the following years Larkin began but failed to finish several more novels, in the last of which, A New World Symphony, he returned once again to the device of a female protagonist-narrator. The novel was [...] finally abandoned around 1954.|$|E
500|$|As [...] states, this [...] "short tutti {{outburst}} ... closes this superb chorus in a {{blaze of}} 'Herrlichkeit'." [...] , commenting on the change of mood in the final section, writes, [...] "The sense of relief after the stifling pathos of the opening sections is palpable ... After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch as you do it unto them, you do it unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first movement, set to <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E

500|$|In 1892 Palairet {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team, and {{according}} to Wisden, [...] "had a most brilliant season." [...] Palairet used himself heavily as a bowler for the university; only George Berkeley bowled more deliveries. He took five wickets in an innings {{for the first of}} two occasions during his career in the first innings of Oxford's match against the Gentlemen, and followed it up with four wickets in each innings against Lancashire, a match in which he also scored a half-century. He recorded the best bowling figures of his first-class career in the return match against Lancashire, taking six wickets for 84 runs at Old Trafford, and in the following game against Sussex, Bolton says, [...] "Palairet played <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> innings and bowled to some effect". Facing Cambridge in the University match, he was out without scoring in the first innings, but centuries from Malcolm Jardine and Vernon Hill took Oxford to 365. Cambridge were dismissed for 160, and were forced to follow on, whereupon they reached 388, leaving Oxford requiring 184 runs to win. Palairet, who had injured himself while fielding, opted not to open the batting, promoting Frank Phillips in his place. Oxford started poorly, falling to 17 for two, but coming in at number five, Palairet batted {{for an hour and a}} half to score 71 runs and help his side to victory. He topped the batting averages for Oxford in 1892, scoring 509 runs at 36.35, and his 28 wickets came at 22.28.|$|E
500|$|Clay, {{the protagonist}} of Less Than Zero, [...] "once a paralyzed observer, is now a more active {{character}} and has grown to be a narcissist". The reason behind this shift in character personality was due to Ellis's {{lack of interest in}} the other characters—thus the solipsism is mirrored in the fiction. For Ellis, this became [...] "an exploration of intense narcissism." [...] In 2010, Clay is now a [...] "successful screenwriter" [...] with the [...] "occasional producer credit". He returns to LA to help cast The Listeners (reminiscent of Ellis' involvement with the 2009 film adaptation of his short story collection The Informers). Now 45, and no longer a disaffected teen, Clay is described by Details as [...] "arguably worse than American Psychos Patrick Bateman"; Ellis says that he would not disagree with this, citing the ambiguous nature of Bateman's crimes. In terms of Clay's psychology, Ellis notes his preponderance for a [...] "masochistic cycle of control and rejection and seduction and inevitable pain", which [...] "is something he gets off on because he's ...a masochist and not a romantic." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes how Clay [...] "shares biographical details with Ellis", a successful party-boy, who in 1985 was [...] "often conflated with his fictional counterpart." [...] Ellis asserts to the contrary, [...] "I'm not really Clay." [...] As opposed to his portrayal in Less Than Zero, Clay is more unambiguously manipulative in Bedrooms; he is, in Ellis' words, [...] "guilty". As in Zero, Clay has stagnated in an impassive and jaded state, abusing alcohol and sedatives such as ambien, [...] "living with a kind of psychic [...] "locked-in" [...] syndrome." [...] As in Zero and Psycho, the novel also poses the question of Clay's perception of reality, The Independent asking [...] "Is Clay really being followed or is he being dogged by a guilty conscience for crimes committed, even when they are crimes of inaction?" [...] Over the novel, [...] "Clay shifts from damaged to depraved"; a [...] "final scene in Imperial Bedrooms of unremitting torture... enacted by Clay on <b>two</b> <b>beautiful</b> teenagers who are bought and systematically abused" [...] demonstrates [...] "Clay's graduation from a passively colluding observer to active perpetrator... who either indulges in torture or fantasizes about it." ...|$|E
