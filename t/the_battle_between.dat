5|$|According to Appian, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Gellius' legions and Crixus' men near Mount Garganus was the {{beginning}} of a long and complex series of military maneuvers that almost resulted in the Spartacan forces directly assaulting the city of Rome itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Suwon Airfield was {{the first}} aerial battle of the Korean War {{occurring}} on June 27, 1950 over Kimpo Airfield and Suwon Airfield. <b>The</b> <b>battle,</b> <b>between</b> aircraft of the United States and North Korea, ended in {{a victory for the}} US Air Force after nine of its aircraft successfully shot down seven North Korean People's Air Force aircraft.

5|$|The {{concept for}} the Fuchikoma came from one climactic {{scene of the}} film: <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of paleontology. Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, {{designed}} for one person, {{that would be used}} by the police. Thus, the player becomes the pilot of one of these combat machines.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later {{research suggests that the}} North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, and it is likely that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> 500 and 2,000.|$|E

50|$|The Elizabethan Age {{is viewed}} so highly {{largely because of}} the periods before and after.

The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.|$|R

5|$|In Pali-Pember, {{the ritual}} of the {{marriage}} of Khandoba with Mhalsa is annually performed. Turmeric is offered to the deities. Two festivals are celebrated in honour of Mailara, as Khandoba is known in Karnataka. These are the Dasara festival at Devaragudda, and an eleven-day festival in Magha month (February–March) in Mailar, Bellary district. Both festivals have enactments of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Mailar and the demons Mani-Malla. Chaitra Purnima (full-moon day) is also considered auspicious. In general, Sundays, associated with the sun-god, are considered as considered auspicious for Khandoba worship.|$|E
5|$|Legends of Khandoba {{generally}} {{tell about}} <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the deity and demons Malla and Mani. The principle written {{source of the}} legend is Malhari Mahatmya (Mallari Mahatmya), which claims {{to be from the}} chapter Kshetra-kanda of the Sanskrit text Brahmanda Purana, but is not included in standard editions of the Purana. R.C. Dhere and Sontheimer suggests that the Sanskrit Mahatmya was composed around 1460-1510 AD, mostly by a Deshastha Brahmin, to whom Khandoba is the family deity. A version is also available in Marathi by Siddhapal Kesasri (1585). Other sources include the later texts of Jayadri Mahatmya and Martanda Vijaya by Gangadhara (1821) and the oral stories of the Vaghyas, bards of the god.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes were drawn by Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain was drawn by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film was drawn by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld was drawn by Masahiro Ando; action scenes were drawn by Shinji Aramaki; and <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Wrath and Gluttony was drawn by Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|E
5|$|The rain {{eventually}} became heavier, making the conditions treacherous and bringing the safety car back out. This put a temporary stop to <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Aston Martin and Corvette for {{first and second}} place in the GT1 class. The second place Corvette had been quicker in the wet conditions, but it was not allowed to further close on the Aston Martin during the safety period. After problems for both of the Barazi-Epsilon LMP2s, Binnie Motorsports brought its class leading LMP2 car to the garage to ensure that the car was prepared for the weather and could hold on to the lead until the finish.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} of the see of York was its lack of suffragan bishops. Thurstan managed to secure {{the resurrection of the}} Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, in what is now Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his subkingdom had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian– Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated Æthelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Spider-Man 3 {{began on}} January 16, 2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006. In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland {{due to the}} Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city's convention center at no cost. In Cleveland, they shot <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car. Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006 until July 1, 2006. Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture. Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Time {{crew was}} {{satisfied}} with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch central {{division}} {{joined the}} battle {{at the head}} of the line shortly after the engagement of Triumph and Bedford, causing considerable damage to all of the British vessels, particularly Venerable. The British flagship was soon isolated in the midst of the Dutch van, engaging Vrijheid, Staaten General, Admiral Tjerk Hiddes De Vries and Wassenaar simultaneously. Despite the heavy odds Duncan continued to fight hard, the British succeeded in knocking out two opponents by wounding Captain Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt of Beschermer, which drifted eastwards in confusion, while shots from either Bedford or Triumph set a powder barrel on Hercules on fire. The blaze on the latter ship, which soon spread to the sails and rigging, prompted a lull in the battle as the crew of Hercules desperately attempted to extinguish the blaze and other Dutch ships scrambled to escape the burning vessel as it drifted through the melee. Shortly afterwards, the battered Wassenaar surrendered to Triumph, with Captain Holland dead on his quarterdeck. Triumph then moved on towards <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>between</b> Vrijheid and Venerable, at which time the crew of Wassenaar raised their colours again after being fired on by a Dutch brig.|$|E
