5|$|Revolution {{broke out}} in St. Petersburg {{in the spring of}} 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her {{siblings}} were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of March 13, 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died.

5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E

Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{set himself}} to {{finishing}} Ulysses in Paris, delighted {{to find that}} he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Miss Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an eyepatch. He was treated by Dr Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time, who after reading Ulysses {{is said to have}} concluded <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.|$|E

Olivia's mother, Maya Lewis (Khandi Alexander), is introduced both in the present day and in flashbacks. Olivia comes to believe <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> made the decision to kill her mother, which was very different than her prior beliefs about her mother's death.

It is later revealed that her mother is alive and has been held prisoner by her father in a maximum security prison for 20 years for national security reasons. Lewis escapes.

5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E

5|$|Before Little's purchase, the punchbowl {{had been}} the {{property}} of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan, New South Wales Agent-General in London, who bought the bowl for ₤40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection. The bowl was subsequently {{in the possession of}} Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan's unexpected death in London on 30April 1926. Coghlan had personally collected the bowl from a Miss Hall at 'Highfield', 63 Seabrook Rd, Hythe (Kent), England, a few months after she had decided to offer the bowl to the New South Wales Government for ₤50. Earlier, a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher, Jessie Stead, on 6August 1923, resulted in the proposal that the bowl ought to be the property of the City of Sydney. Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> acquired the bowl in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed the bowl was commissioned for William Bligh, New South Wales's fourth Governor (in office 1806–1808). In 2002, the State Library of New South Wales digitised the punchbowl images {{with the support of the}} Nelson Meers Foundation, a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts, and the bowl became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library's centenary celebrations in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Having visited Bath, in {{the hope}} its waters would aid conception, Queen Mary became {{pregnant}} in late 1687. When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas, Catholics rejoiced. Protestants, who had tolerated James's Catholic government {{because he had no}} Catholic heir, were concerned. The Protestant disillusion came to a head after the child was known to be male, and many Protestants believed the child was spurious; if not, James II's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated. Popular opinion alleged that the child, named James Francis Edward, was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen's real but stillborn child. This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants, despite the many witnesses of the birth. Mainly by mismanagement on James' part, these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid; most of the witnesses were Catholics or foreigners, and several, such as the Princess Anne of Denmark, later to be Queen Anne, and the Protestant prelates, or the family of the Princesses whom the new birth would remove from the direct succession, were not allowed to be present. Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward's birth for her sister, the Princess of Orange. Anne's answers, biased and unreliable, convinced the Princess of Orange <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> thrust a changeling upon the nation. Count Zuylestein, returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth, agreed with Anne's findings.|$|E

25|$|Le Vau redid the exteriors of Saint-Fargeau {{at a cost}} of 200,000 livres. They {{were lost}} in a fire in 1752 and {{suffered}} further damage in 1850, thus all evidence of the appearance of Mademoiselle's residence was lost. Despite being an exile, she still visited her father at Blois. While at Saint-Fargeau, she dabbled in writing and wrote a small biography under the title of Madame de Fouquerolles despite her bad spelling and grammar. Mademoiselle looked to her financial affairs, which had been under her father's management. Having reached her majority in 1652 it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> not been entirely honest with the management of her finances and that was the reason for her 800,000 livres of debt. At the same time her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Guise, tricked Mademoiselle into signing away money to her under false pretences. Her father was involved with this, which caused her relationship with Gaston to deteriorate. In 1656, hearing <b>that</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been excused for his various scandals, Mademoiselle herself said she would forget the bad blood caused by his financial misdemeanours and resumed her close relationship with him.|$|E
