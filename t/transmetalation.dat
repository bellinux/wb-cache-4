5|$|Rhodocenium salts {{were first}} {{reported}} {{within two years}} of the discovery of ferrocene. These salts were prepared by reacting the carbanion Grignard reagent cyclopentadienylmagnesium bromide (C5H5MgBr) with tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III) (Rh(acac)3). More recently, gas-phase rhodocenium cations have been generated by a redox <b>transmetalation</b> reaction of rhodium(I) ions with ferrocene or nickelocene.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox <b>transmetalation</b> and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a <b>transmetalation</b> reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E

In contrast, with the EWO phosphine, the β-H elimination from intermediate [PdArEt(P-EWO) ] is slow compared to the fast Ar–Et reductive elimination, and the undesired reduction product ArH observed proceeds in this case of hydrolysis of ZnArEt, formed in <b>transmetalations</b> where Ar is transferred from Pd to Zn. The rate of these <b>transmetalations</b> is comparable to the rate of reductive eliminations. Consequently, undesired <b>transmetalations</b> affording [PdEt 2 (P-EWO) ] and ZnArEt are more effective at early stages of the reactions and less effective when the ethylating agent becomes poorer in ZnEt 2 and richer in ZnEtX (X = I), as the reaction proceeds. Careful analysis of the experiments reveals the detailed changing evolution of the reaction, not only providing the main features of the catalytic cycle but also deducing how the reagents in the system change with time and what the effects on the products of these changes are.

In the case of organocopper coupling with aryl halides the reaction proceed via aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction.

50|$|<b>Transmetalation</b> is an {{organometallic}} reaction where ligands {{are transferred}} from one species to another.

The exact mechanism of <b>transmetalation</b> for the Suzuki coupling remains to be discovered. The organoboron compounds do not undergo <b>transmetalation</b> in the absence of base and it is therefore widely believed that the role of the base is to activate the organoboron compound as well as facilitate the formation of R2-Pdll-OtBu from R2-Pdll-X.|$|E

50|$|The <b>transmetalation</b> of the trans {{intermediate}} {{from the}} oxidative addition step {{is believed to}} proceed via a variety of mechanisms depending on the substrates and conditions. The {{most common type of}} <b>transmetalation</b> for the Stille coupling involves an associative mechanism. This pathway implies that the organostannane, normally a tin atom bonded to an allyl, alkenyl, or aryl group, can coordinate to the palladium via one of these double bonds. This produces a fleeting pentavalent, 18-electron species, which can then undergo ligand detachment to form a square planar complex again. Despite the organostannane being coordinated to the palladium through the R2 group, R2 must be formally transferred to the palladium (the R2-Sn bond must be broken), and the X group must leave with the tin, completing the <b>transmetalation.</b> This is believed to occur through two mechanisms.|$|E

Some of the cross-coupling reactions that include a <b>transmetalation</b> step are Stille cross-coupling, Suzuki cross-coupling, Sonogashira cross-coupling, and Negishi cross-coupling. The most useful cross-coupling catalysts tend to be ones that contain palladium. Cross-coupling reactions have the general form of R′-X + M-R → R′-R + M-X and are used to form C-C bonds. R and R′ can be any carbon fragment. The identity of the metal, M, depends on which cross-coupling reaction is being used. Stille reactions use tin, Suzuki reactions use boron, Sonogashira reactions use copper, and Negishi reactions use zinc. The <b>transmetalation</b> step in palladium catalyzed reactions involve the addition of an R-M compound to produce an R′-Pd-R compound.
