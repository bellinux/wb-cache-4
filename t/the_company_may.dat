5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E
25|$|Claimants with {{non-monetary}} {{claims against}} <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> {{be able to}} enforce their rights against the company. For example, a party who had a valid contract {{for the purchase of}} land against <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> be able to obtain an order for specific performance, and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.|$|E

25|$|Without {{enough money}} to {{continue}} investing in finding new sources or upgrading infrastructure, and being protected constitutionally from private and foreign investment, some have predicted <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> face institutional collapse. While the oil industry is still relevant for the government's budget, its importance in GDP and exports has steadily fallen since the 1980s. In 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons why an {{acquiring}} <b>company</b> <b>may</b> wish to purchase another company. Some takeovers are opportunistic - <b>the</b> target <b>company</b> <b>may</b> simply be very reasonably priced {{for one reason or another}} and <b>the</b> acquiring <b>company</b> <b>may</b> decide that in the long run, it will end up making money by purchasing <b>the</b> target <b>company.</b> <b>The</b> large holding <b>company</b> Berkshire Hathaway has profited well over time by purchasing many companies opportunistically in this manner.|$|R

25|$|If {{a company}} {{carrying}} {{on more than}} one trade draws up accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> determine that any one of those dates shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining whether an accounting period has ended under the rule in the second bullet point above.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> {{elect to}} simply be struck off the Register as a cheaper {{alternative}} to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the Registrar, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause {{to believe that the}} company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.|$|E

These included installation of an aftermarket rear fog-light and its illuminated dashboard switch to meet UK legislation (Not OEM, or a requirement in Japan). <b>The</b> <b>Company</b> <b>may</b> also have fitted an 'English' text version of fuse box cover in the engine bay, and/or a RalliArt oil cap.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} 120 days of paid {{maternity leave}} {{to women and}} seven days to men. The law also prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy tests or present sterilization certificates, but some employers sought sterilization certificates from female job applicants or tried to avoid hiring women of childbearing age. Violations of the law are punishable by jail terms for employers of up to two years, while <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> be fined 10 times the salary of its highest-paid employee.|$|E
25|$|For these reasons, Dow {{is looking}} to the Middle East and Asia for new projects. In Kuwait, Dow is {{constructing}} (with PIC of Kuwait) a new world-scale ethane cracker for production of ethylene, along with an ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plant and (for 2008) a facility for production of aromatic hydrocarbons. In Oman, the company {{is working with the}} Oman government to build a new world-scale polyethylene plant. In China, the company is collaborating with Shenhua Group (the country's largest coal mining company) to improve catalyst efficiency to allow viable conversion of coal to olefins. Dow is also seeking to expand its R presence in Asia, adding 600 jobs in Shanghai by the end of 2007, and <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> open up a large R center in India.|$|E

25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating part of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> have a {{much higher}} credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five}} years from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today the present value of a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have {{travelled}} from the western Midlands to East Anglia. The nature of his work for <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> be estimated from his parts in The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke. The preface to the 1609 quarto indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, a witty fool of the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the King's Revels Children, a short-lived troupe of boy players led by Nathan Field, but it was almost certainly written around 1597.|$|E
500|$|Corporations are {{increasingly}} recognizing {{the benefits of}} green marketing, although {{there is often a}} thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons. The term “greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits. The primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with the feeling that the organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint. In reality, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> be doing very little that is environmentally beneficial ...|$|E

[...] Tsutomu Okubo, who is to chair a new working team to discuss reforms to the company act to strengthen corporate governance, questioned whether the corporate auditor system was functioning properly, and whether the company's accountants were acting as a proper check on management. Toshio Oguchi, representative director of Governance for Owners in Tokyo, argued that the affair pointed to a dysfunctional board: [...] "Even if they didn't know about the tobashi, {{the fact that the}} board approved the payment cannot have been a correct decision.” ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1995, Andy Gavin and Taylor Kurosaki took {{footage from}} the game and spent two days editing it into a two-minute [...] "preview tape", which would be {{deliberately}} leaked to a friend at Sony Computer Entertainment so that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>may</b> view it. Due to management issues at Sony, {{it would not be}} until March 1996 that Sony would agree to publish the game, which went into the alpha stage in April 1996. While preparing for the game's demonstration at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the team decided to finally rename the title character [...] "Crash Bandicoot" [...] (the particular name being credited to Dave Baggett and Taylor Kurosaki), with his surname being based on his canonical species and his first name stemming from the visceral reaction to the character's destruction of boxes ("Dash", [...] "Smash", and [...] "Bash" [...] were other potential names). The name change was contested between Naughty Dog and marketing director Kelly Flaherty, who was discredited in postmortems by Gavin and Rubin.|$|E
