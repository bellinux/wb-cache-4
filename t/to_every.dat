Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native <b>to</b> <b>every</b> continent except Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter <b>to</b> <b>every</b> four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft <b>to</b> <b>every</b> two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E

5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children.

This tradition, however, did not extend <b>to</b> <b>every</b> West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E

5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals <b>to</b> <b>every</b> part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year.

In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members <b>to</b> <b>every</b> 1 call.|$|E
