40|$|<b>Tumble</b> dryers {{and drying}} {{cabinets}} have {{to a large}} extent replaced the traditional way of drying clothes outdoors. They are faster, more convenient, require less space and can be operated regardless of weather conditions. This replacement has significantly increased residential energy consumption, {{due to the fact that}} <b>tumbles</b> dryers consume large amounts of electrical energy. In the USA 9 % of the households electric energy is consumed when drying clothes. Over 4 million <b>tumble</b> dryers are sold in Europe each year and 20 % of the residential electricity consumption in Sweden is used drying and washing clothes. <b>Tumble</b> dryers are also utilized in the industrial sector, but industrial dryers are not considered in this study. Increasing energy costs contributes to the public’s awareness and desire to cut their energy consumption. The aim of this study is to increase the energy efficiency and drastically reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> dryers. There are two main types of <b>tumble</b> dryers available on the market; the open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer and the closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. The open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer is often attached to the ventilation system and thereby it evacuates its exhaust air. The closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer condenses the water from the air before it recirculates it. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> dryers, two separate studies were made. One on a water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer and one on a hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. Both <b>tumble</b> dryers where rebuild and originated from the same <b>tumble</b> dryer. The <b>tumble</b> dryer that both studies originated from was a conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. The <b>tumble</b> dryer is made by Asko Cylinda AB. The results reveal that the water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer does not have greater energy efficiency than the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. However the drying time was reduced by 37 %. The result also reveals that the hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer cuts the electric consumption by 93 % and improves the energy efficiency by 53 % compared to the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. On the other hand the drying time increases by 9 %...|$|R

By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and <b>tumbled</b> down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

40|$|Some mutants {{defective}} in chemotaxis show incessant <b>tumbling</b> {{behavior and}} are called <b>tumbling</b> mutants. Previously described <b>tumbling</b> mutations lie in two genes, cheB and cheZ (41. 5 min on Escherichia coli map). Genetic analysis of various <b>tumbling</b> mutants, however, revealed that two more genetic loci, cheC (43 min) and cheE (99. 2 min), could also mutate to produce <b>tumbling</b> mutants. The genetic map around cheC was revised: his flaP flaQ flaR flbD flaA (= cheC) flaE. flbD {{is a new}} gene. When cells were starved for methionine, the <b>tumbling</b> mutants changed their swimming behavior depending on the che gene mutated. cheZ mutants, like wild-type bacteria, ceased <b>tumbling</b> shortly after removal of methionine. The <b>tumbling</b> of cheB or cheE mutants was depressed after prolonged methionine starvation {{in the presence of}} a constant level of an attractant. cheC <b>tumbling</b> mutants appeared unique in that they did not cease <b>tumbling</b> even when cells were deprived of methionine. By contrast, arsenate treatment of the <b>tumbling</b> mutants resulted in smooth swimming of the cells in every case. These results suggest that two different processes are involved in regulation of tumbling; one requiring methionine and the other requiring some phosphorylated compound...|$|R
40|$|Results from an {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} low-speed <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of twelve generic flying-wing models are summarized. There is a concern that airplanes with flying-wing planforms could inadvertently enter an out-of-control <b>tumbling</b> motion under certain conditions. The objectives of this investigation were to: 1) identify the geometric and mass-related parameters that cause flying wings {{to be capable of}} sustained <b>tumbling,</b> 2) analyze some of the driving mechanisms that cause <b>tumbling,</b> and 3) determine the feasibility of using computer simulations to predict the <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of flying wings. Free-tumble and free-to-pitch tests were conducted with dynamically-scaled, generic flying wing models. The use of computer simulations as a predictive tool for <b>tumbling</b> was explored. Results indicated that center-of-gravity location, mass distribution, and geometric aspect ratio strongly affected the <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of the models tested and that positive static stability did not necessarily preclude <b>tumbling.</b> The magnitude of dynamic effects were found to be of the same order as static effects for the models undergoing autorotation-in-pitch. The simulations indicated that the dynamic terms in the equations of motion used to predict <b>tumbling</b> must be obtained using experimental methods that account for the large amplitude/high pitch-rate environment that characterizes <b>tumbling...</b>|$|R

5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore.

40|$|To {{understand}} output {{control in}} bacterial chemotaxis, we varied {{the levels of}} expression of cellular cheY and cheZ genes {{and found that the}} overproduction of the corresponding proteins affected Escherichia coli swimming behavior. In the absence of other signal-transducing gene products, CheY overproduction made free-swimming cells <b>tumble</b> more frequently. A plot of the fraction of the population that are <b>tumbling</b> versus the CheY concentration was hyperbolic, with half of the population <b>tumbling</b> at 30 microM (25, 000 copies per cell) CheY monomers in the cytosol. Overproduction of aspartate receptor (Tar) by 30 -fold had a negligible effect on CheY-induced <b>tumbling,</b> so Tar does not sequester CheY. CheZ overproduction decreased <b>tumbling</b> in all <b>tumbling</b> mutants except certain flaAII(cheC) mutants.

This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse.

40|$|By {{using the}} children's own {{thoughts}} and stories this theses aim {{to investigate and}} illustrate the phenomenon of rough and <b>tumble</b> play and its existence among five year olds in preschool.      The formulations of the questions are: What do children consider as rough and <b>tumble</b> play? - and what characterise that? From without a perspective of rough and <b>tumble</b> play, which kinds of rough and <b>tumble</b> play do the children play in preschool? - and how do those characterise? What makes rough and <b>tumble</b> play possible and accepted {{for the children to}} play in preschool? In this thesis I have investigated the questions above by interviewing 11 five years olds about how they consider rough and <b>tumble</b> play in preschool. From without Birgitta Knutsdotter Olofsson's and Torben Hangaard Rasmussen's view about play and rough and <b>tumble</b> play I created a perspective of rough and <b>tumble</b> play, which I used for analyzing the empirics. With rough and <b>tumble</b> play I mean games or plays that includes wrestling, hitting, kicking, pushing, chasing, running or/and the use of weapons against other human beings or other visualized beings or/and human beings. The conclusions are that children has many different opinions of what rough and <b>tumble</b> play is. Depends on who you are asking you will get a different perspective. The conclusions also shows that rough and <b>tumble</b> play can exist, not just by its self, but also in interplay with other kinds of games and plays. The children are using different strategies to make the rough and <b>tumble</b> play fit the restrictions put on by the educators in the preschool. ...|$|R
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault <b>tumbled</b> as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM {{ascent stage}} was jettisoned. Because of a failure by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially <b>tumbled</b> after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E
5|$|As the 1936 season began, Hammond {{remained}} weak {{from the}} recent removal of his tonsils. Returning to cricket too soon, he was in poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss {{the first of three}} Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by Wisden for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which was Tom Goddard's benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets <b>tumbled</b> on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 {{out of a total of}} 485.|$|E
40|$|Chemotactic {{responses}} are mediated by modulation {{of the frequency}} of <b>tumbling.</b> Studies with methionine auxotrophs of wild-type Escherichia coli and four mutants which <b>tumble</b> continuously show that methionine or one of its metabolites {{is involved in the}} <b>tumbling</b> process. Following removal of methionine, the wild type and two mutants, after various periods of time, became unable to <b>tumble.</b> The presence of constant levels of chemical attractants considerably shortened these periods in the three strains and eliminated <b>tumbling</b> in another mutant. This effect of attractants considerably shortened these periods in the three strains and eliminated <b>tumbling</b> in another mutant. This effect of attractants implies that methionine or some derivative of methionine is also involved in transducing chemical stimuli to bacterial responses...|$|R
40|$|Many {{bacteria}} {{perform a}} run-and-tumble random walk {{to explore their}} surrounding and to perform chemotaxis. In this article we present a novel method to infer the relevant parameters of bacterial motion from experimental trajectories including the <b>tumbling</b> events. We introduce a stochastic model for the orientation angle, where a shot-noise process initiates <b>tumbles,</b> and analytically calculate conditional moments, reminiscent of Kramers-Moyal coefficients. Matching them with the moments calculated from experimental trajectories of the bacteria E. coli and Pseudomonas putida, {{we are able to}} infer their respective <b>tumble</b> rates, the rotational diffusion constants, and the distributions of <b>tumble</b> angles in good agreement with results from conventional <b>tumble</b> recognizers. We also define a novel <b>tumble</b> recognizer, which explicitly quantifies the error in recognizing <b>tumbles.</b> In the presence of a chemical gradient we condition the moments on the bacterial direction of motion and thereby explore the chemotaxis strategy. For both bacteria we recover and quantify the classical chemotactic strategy, where the <b>tumble</b> rate is smallest along the chemical gradient. In addition, for E. coli we detect some cells, which bias their mean <b>tumble</b> angle towards smaller values. Our findings are supported by a scaling analysis of appropriate ratios of conditional moments, which are directly calculated from experimental data...|$|R
