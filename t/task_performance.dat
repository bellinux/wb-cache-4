25|$|Research of EI and job {{performance}} shows mixed results: a positive relation {{has been found}} in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one. This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006) to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and {{job performance}} becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, & Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher <b>task</b> <b>performance</b> and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.|$|E
25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the problem may be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that <b>task,</b> <b>performance</b> fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E

25|$|Process indices {{examine how}} {{individuals}} process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing {{that leads to}} SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and <b>task</b> <b>performance</b> (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal of Social Psychology, in which they intended to understand <b>task</b> <b>performance</b> among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.|$|E
25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or <b>task</b> <b>performance,</b> including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E

This research is part of a project to modernize the physical fitness test of the Colombian Army. Data collection was performed at the 13 th Battalion of Instruction and Training, located 30 km south of Bogota D. C., with a temperature range from 1 ºC to 23 ºC during the study period, and at 3100 m above sea level. The sample was composed by 60 volunteers from three different platoons.

25|$|A new {{scientific}} understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on <b>task</b> <b>performance.</b> The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferrable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are highly correlated with full-scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.|$|E
25|$|Leader-focused {{approaches}} look to organizational {{leaders to}} determine the characteristics of effective leadership. According to the trait approach, more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach {{is being used to}} predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive. Another leader-focused approached is the behavioral approach which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) consideration; and (2) initiating structure. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the <b>task</b> <b>performance</b> of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is power and influence. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power, and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, consultation, ingratiation, exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Executive {{functions}} have {{a protracted}} course of development across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. The present study adopts a ‘core component’ approach to studying the developmental progression of executive functioning {{with a specific}} focus on <b>task</b> switching <b>performance.</b> A number of theoretical models define working memory, inhibition, and task switching as core components of executive functioning, and show that these components are both independent and share common variance. This thesis details {{the creation of a}} new paradigm that allowed <b>task</b> switching <b>performance,</b> working memory span, and resistance to interference to be measured while holding constant task-specific factors such as stimulus- and response-demands. The main aim was to utilise this paradigm to examine how working memory and resistance to interference were associated with <b>task</b> switching <b>performance,</b> and more specifically, how these core components of executive functioning contribute to developmental change in <b>task</b> switching <b>performance</b> across childhood and early adolescence. A total of 33 young adults (aged 18 - 24 years) and 260 children (aged 4 years 6 months – 13 years 2 months) participated in the study. <b>Task</b> switching <b>performance</b> in adults was associated with working memory span and resistance to interference, but this relationship appeared to be specific to mixing cost measures only. Overall <b>task</b> switching <b>performance</b> improved with age. Path analysis was used to examine whether working memory and/or resistance to interference mediated the relationship between age and task switching RT at a trial specific level (i. e. all-repeat, mixed-repeat, or switch). Overall, both resistance to interference and working memory span mediated age-related change in <b>task</b> switching <b>performance,</b> but in quite different ways. Resistance to interference showed a generalised (non-specific) effect, mediating the effect of age on <b>task</b> switching <b>performance</b> for all trial types. In contrast, working memory span mediated performance under conditions that allowed advance preparation. The implications for these findings for theories of task switching are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Performance {{measures}} [...] "infer" [...] SA {{from the}} end result (i.e., <b>task</b> <b>performance</b> outcomes), {{based on the assumption}} that better performance indicates better SA. Common performance metrics include quantity of output or productivity level, time to perform the task or respond to an event, and the accuracy of the response or, conversely, the number of errors committed. The main advantage of performance measures is that these can be collected objectively and without disrupting <b>task</b> <b>performance.</b> However, although evidence exists to suggest a positive relation between SA and performance, this connection is probabilistic and not always direct and unequivocal (Endsley, 1995b). In other words, good SA does not always lead to good performance and poor SA does not always lead to poor performance (Endsley, 1990). Thus, performance measures should be used in conjunction with others measures of SA that directly assess this construct.|$|E
