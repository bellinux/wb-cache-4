5000|$|Disempowering usual {{perceptions}} of culture, Lhakar started to use art, literature, poetry and {{music as a}} tool to gain greater political rights. They are using aspects of traditional Tibetan culture, such as expressing their faith in the Dalai Lama, and love of their homeland. Songs with politically charged lyrics or music videos with images of the Dalai Lama became more widely circulated and known. This upsurge in the public consumption of Tibetan music and poetry has spawned a modern renaissance in art and literature across the plateau. I has been asserted that through these activities, Tibetans are rediscovering [...] "how culture can save politics, instead of politics to save culture". The Lhakar movement is encouraging the revival of public enthusiasm for studying Tibetan.In various parts of Tibet, elders and children take pledges to speak pure Tibetan, shedding Chinese terms from their vocabulary. Their pledge is as follows:I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> speak pure Tibetan in my family.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> speak pure Tibetan whenever I meet a Tibetan.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> remind myself every day that I am a Tibetan till I die.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> wear only Tibetan traditional dress, chuba, every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> speak only Tibetan every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> learn Tibetan language.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> stop eating meat and only eat a vegetarian diet and gain more merit every Wednesday.I am Tibetan, from <b>today</b> I <b>will</b> only use Tibetan and speak Tibetan when I call or send a message to Tibetans.|$|R

In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all {{due to the lack of}} space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumuʻah, are mandatory for men but optional for women.

A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Bottomley's last public venture was an {{engagement}} at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, {{he lived with}} Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness.

[...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E

500|$|The visitor <b>today</b> <b>will</b> {{find the}} shell {{of the church and}} monastic {{buildings}} around the cloister plus the abbot's house. Little of the post-Dissolution mansion remains aside from the south range, foundations, alterations to the medieval structure in red Tudor brick and traces of the formal gardens. In most places the abbey stands close to its original height. The sacristy/library, the south transept chapels, the treasury, the reredorter undercroft and the lower floor of the abbot's house still have their vaults intact. Medieval heraldic polychrome tiles found on the site {{can be seen in the}} sacristy, and Henry III's foundation stone [...] remains in the church. The abbey ruins are set in wooded parkland to the west of the village of Netley and constitute the most complete surviving Cistercian monastery in southern England. The site is maintained by English Heritage, and is open to the public. Netley is an Ancient Monument protected by law.|$|E

500|$|Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter {{describe}} [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the [...] "quickest song" [...] that Harrison ever wrote, {{in terms}} of time spent on the composition. The words for the song's middle eight – [...] "Yesterday, today was tomorrow / And tomorrow, <b>today</b> <b>will</b> be yesterday" [...] – came from another pair of inscriptions from Crisp's time at Friar Park. Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in a rut, everybody should try ringing out the old and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that <b>today</b> <b>will</b> be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E
