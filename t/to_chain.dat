Batman can use some gadgets while gliding, such as batarangs or the line-launcher. The grapnel gun can now be used to instantly switch directions during a glide, {{as well as being}} fired twice while in the air <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> grappling moves together.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Kripik {{pulls his}} hand {{free of the}} single manacle used <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> him down, but mangles his hand while doing so. Kripik flees the post with his team of sled dogs, heading for his family's old village. Hunt and Balk pursue him. The rifle Kripik steals proves useless when the bullets are not the right gauge. Kripik is forced to kill his sled dogs one by one for food. In a driving blizzard, Kripik falls short of {{reaching}} his family, and is attacked and injured by a wolf (which he manages to kill). Kripik is found by his eldest son Orsodikok (now a teenager), rescued, and fed by his family.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Chain</b> Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E

Buildings in Washington, D.C., remained closed for two days after the hurricane. After the hurricane, several people in central and western Maryland were injured with three killed from carbon monoxide due to improperly running generators in their houses. Additionally, others were injured due <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> saws and cleaning up debris. In the days after the hurricane, the Calvert County Hospital reported an extra 130 patients per day.|$|E
5|$|The German army {{attacked}} Russia on 18 February. The offensive {{led to a}} rapid {{collapse and}} retreat of the Russian troops and to signature of the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine were transferred to the German power sphere. The Civil War of the Finns opened an easy access with low costs to Fennoscandia, where the geopolitical status altered as a British Naval squadron invaded the harbour of Murmansk on the northwestern coast of Russia by the Arctic Ocean on 9 March 1918. General Erich Ludendorff wanted both <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> Petrograd through Narva - Viipuri and German-led monarchy for Finland.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them Radiant Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed in battle.|$|E

40|$|We {{implement}} a binary collision approximation to study pulse propagation {{in a chain}} of o-rings. In particular, we arrive at analytic results from which the pulse velocity is obtained by simple quadrature. The predicted pulse velocity is compared to the velocity obtained from the far more resource-intensive numerical integration of the equations of motion. We study chains without precompression, chains precompressed by a constant force at the chain ends (constant precompression), and chains precompressed by gravity (variable precompression). The application of the binary collision approximation <b>to</b> precompressed <b>chains</b> provides an important generalization of a successful theory that had {{up to this point}} only been implemented <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> without precompression, that is, <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> in a sonic vacuum...|$|R

5|$|Musashi is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game, {{in which the}} player fights against enemies with a sword in action-based combat, with some role-playing elements. The player controls the titular Musashi, who fights a variety of enemies using his swords Fusion and Lumina and searches for five scrolls which will increase Lumina's strength and grant him new abilities. There are also several minigames and puzzles scattered throughout which must be completed to advance the plot. The two swords he uses have varied abilities and uses. Fusion, which resembles a katana, is used <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> rapid combo hits together and {{can also be used}} to absorb Bincho energy, which is a type of magical point system that controls how many spells a player can cast and how quickly, or absorb an enemies' skill. The other sword is Lumina, which cannot be effectively used in combos by itself; instead, it can be imbued with elemental properties from Scrolls. Lumina is primarily offensive but in combination with the five elemental scrolls, it gains new skills. The two swords are often used in conjunction with certain techniques which are granted by various rescued townsfolk.|$|E

25|$|The monad {{represents}} computations with a sequential structure: a monad defines what {{it means}} <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> operations together. This enables the programmer to build pipelines that process data {{in a series of}} steps (i.e. a series of actions applied to the data), in which each action is decorated with the additional processing rules provided by the monad. A monad is defined by a return operator that creates values, and a bind operator used to link the actions in the pipeline; this definition must follow a set of axioms called monad laws, which are needed for the composition of actions in the pipeline to work properly.|$|E

The four head to the sheriff's office, where they find Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), David (Josh Dallas), and Neal. Mary Margaret hands Emma {{the keys to the}} jail, and says to lock her and David in separate cells, as they don't want to hurt themselves or anyone else when Ingrid's curse takes effect. Emma reluctantly does so, and takes her baby brother to protect him.

25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open {{that should have been}} shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.|$|E
500|$|An {{antioxidant}} is {{a molecule}} that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction {{that can produce}} free radicals, leading <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> reactions that may damage cells. Antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions. The term [...] "antioxidant" [...] is mainly used for two different groups of substances: [...] industrial chemicals which are added to products to prevent oxidation, and natural chemicals found in foods and body tissue which {{are said to have}} beneficial health effects.|$|E

[...] Cano states that Moustache was also wounded by the shot, losing an ear. [...] Moustache deserted the grenadiers shortly after the French victory at Marengo, apparently because one of them attempted <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> him to a sentry box, and instead joined a company of mounted cuirassiers.|$|E

500|$|Though {{a direct}} sequel to Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X-2 does not {{duplicate}} its predecessor's gameplay; instead, it innovates on traditional elements. Like pre-Final Fantasy X installments, characters [...] "level up" [...] {{after a certain}} number of battles, by gaining pre-determined stat bonuses. The conditional turn-based battle system in Final Fantasy X {{has been replaced by a}} faster-paced variation of the Final Fantasy series' traditional active time battle (ATB) system, which was originally designed by Hiroyuki Ito and first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Whenever a random enemy is encountered, the ATB system is used. Under this enhanced version of the ATB, playable characters may interrupt an enemy while they are preparing to take action, in lieu of waiting for an enemy's turn to finish before attacking. Furthermore, it is possible for both characters and enemies <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> attacks together for greater damage.|$|E
500|$|Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States {{reached its}} height in the 1870-1900 era. The {{size of the}} Swedish-American community in 1865 is estimated at 25,000 people, a figure soon to be surpassed by the yearly Swedish immigration. By 1890 the U.S. census reported a Swedish-American population of nearly 800,000, with immigration peaking in 1869 and again in 1887. Most of this influx settled in the North. The great majority {{of them had been}} peasants in the old country, pushed away from Sweden by disastrous crop failures and pulled towards America by the cheap land resulting from the 1862 Homestead Act. Most immigrants became pioneers, clearing and cultivating the virgin land of the Midwest and extending the pre-Civil War settlements further west, into Kansas and Nebraska. Once sizable Swedish farming communities had formed on the prairie, the greatest impetus for further peasant migration came through personal contacts. The iconic [...] "America-letter" [...] to relatives and friends at home spoke directly from a position of trust and shared background, carrying immediate conviction. At the height of migration, familial America-letters could lead <b>to</b> <b>chain</b> reactions which would all but depopulate some Swedish parishes, dissolving tightly knit communities which then re-assembled in the Midwest.|$|E
500|$|Although {{proposals}} to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base were initially rejected, the United States Department of Defense eventually expended over $100million to begin repairs. Unsalvageable buildings were demolished. Reconstruction then began on a Florida Air National Guard tower, {{air traffic control}} tower, and maintenance hangars. Next, the rebuilding of communications, medical, security facility, vehicle maintenance, and wing headquarters buildings began. On March5, 1994, the base reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base. Prior to Andrew, the base employed approximately 6,500military personnel and 1,000civilians and annually added about $450million to the local economy. After its reopening, Major Bobby D'Angelo expected the base to annually contribute {{less than half of}} that [...] between $180million and $200million. The city of Homestead spent about $6million on rebuilding the Homestead Sports Complex. Despite this, the Cleveland Indians, fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans, moved their spring training location <b>to</b> <b>Chain</b> of Lakes Park in Winter Haven. As homes were being rebuilt, FEMA provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501families and financial assistance to more than 40,000other families for staying in hotel rooms, paying rent, and repairing homes. Nearly two years after Andrew, about 70% of homes in Homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt. Additionally, of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout Dade County, 36,000had been restored by July 1994.|$|E
