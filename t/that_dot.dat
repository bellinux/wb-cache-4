5|$|According to author Pauline Frommer, Dot {{has been}} {{embraced by the}} viewing British {{population}} as a cultural archetype. Brown has suggested <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> has universal appeal because everybody knows a person like Dot. In 2009, a poll by magazine Inside Soap named Dot as the UK's 'greatest gossip' in a soap opera.|$|E

The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, it was {{reported}} that Dot's estranged half-sister, Rose, would join the series, played by Polly Perkins. Reports stated <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> and Rose fell out when the latter had an affair with the former's husband, Charlie, but Dot would decide to track Rose down after suffering a bout of hypochondria, feeling it is time to put things right, however, Rose will not be pleased to see Dot again after so many years.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August1, an {{unidentified}} ship roughly 950mi (1,550km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70mph (110km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Dot. Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, {{the lack of}} ship reports between July27 and August1 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same. Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> had intensified to hurricane strength by August2. Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000UTC on August3, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg), making Dot a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{over the}} central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea, Tropical Storm Dot grew {{in size and}} intensity. By June7, the storm entered the South China Sea and {{acquired}} a brief northerly component to its track. At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, Dot attained typhoon status on June8. Following {{the development of an}} eye, the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph). By the morning of June9, the JMA assessed Dot to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.2inHg).|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, Dot is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>Dot</b> cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.|$|E

25|$|While {{the main}} line of US20 takes a direct path between Hamburg, Buffalo, and East Bloomfield via Avon, US20A veers to the south to serve several villages and hamlets, {{including}} the villages of Geneseo and Warsaw. The town of Attica, famous for the Attica Prison riots of 1971, lies between US20 and US20A. As the route heads east, US20A connects to several north–south freeways, such as NY400 outside of East Aurora and Interstate390 (I-390) between Geneseo and Lakeville. Outside of the communities <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> the highway, US20A is a two-lane, rural highway.|$|E
25|$|By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry {{as it is}} today, due {{to reduced}} {{precipitation}} and higher temperatures resulting from {{a shift in the}} Earth's orbit. As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.|$|E

25|$|Another core idea of M-Theory {{is close}} in spirit to {{ideas from the}} field of {{compressed}} sensing. An implication from Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma says that a particular number of images can be embedded into a low-dimensional feature space with the same distances between images by using random projections. This result suggests <b>that</b> <b>dot</b> product between the observed image and some other image stored in memory, called template, {{can be used as a}} feature helping to distinguish the image from other images. The template need not to be anyhow related to the image, it could be chosen randomly.|$|E
