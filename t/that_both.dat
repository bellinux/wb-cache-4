5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; <b>that</b> <b>both</b> refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; <b>that</b> <b>both</b> rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E

5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, which means <b>that</b> <b>both</b> organisms maintain {{a relationship that}} benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the queen conch). Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} shows <b>that</b> <b>both</b> food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation {{of the eggs}} in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
