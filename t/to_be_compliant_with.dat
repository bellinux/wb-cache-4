25|$|Novelty acts (such as shower shows, fire shows, and oil wrestling) can be {{presented}} on dedicated stages, temporary staging on the floor, {{or on the}} main stage itself depending on the club. The main stage, if used, must be prepared and possibly covered to prevent damage, as accidents and injuries have been reported during these types of striptease performances. When dangerous materials such as fire are used as props a permit may be required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> local ordinances. Novelty acts are typically performed by feature dancers or by select house dancers during a featured performance. Shower shows require special equipment, so {{they are more likely}} to have a dedicated stage in the club with house dancers performing in the show. Optional staging can be present on the main floor or in dedicated rooms throughout larger clubs.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in {{contempt}} {{of the permanent}} injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [...] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> the ruling. [...] The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with [...] "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of new coaches allowed for improvements in service on the Dover Plains Branch. The first peak through service since the 1970s was inaugurated in October 1991. At the same time, a Sunday night through train was added. The reduced travel times made the line more attractive to commuters. In 1994, Metro-North conducted a train movement analysis of service on the branch to determine whether trains would pass one another based on speeds and the condition of tracks. As a result, a new [...] passing siding was constructed at Wingdale, increasing service flexibility and allowing for increased service in 1996. Also around this time, 447 additional parking spaces were added to stations on the Branch. In 1996, four car length high-level platforms with heated shelters were built at Patterson, Pawling, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, replacing low-level platforms that could only accommodate two cars. These platforms were made <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compliant</b> <b>with</b> the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Travel times could be reduced further as it would take less time for passengers to exit and board the trains.|$|E
