5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government,</b> Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E

50|$|Among all urban local governments, {{municipal}} corporations enjoy {{a greater}} degree of fiscal autonomy and functions although the specific fiscal and functional powers vary across <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> these local <b>governments</b> have larger populations, a more diversified economic base, and deal with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments</b> directly. On <b>the</b> other hand, municipalities have less autonomy, smaller jurisdictions and have to deal with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments</b> through <b>the</b> Directorate of Municipalities or through the collector of a district. These local bodies are subject to detailed supervisory control and guidance by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a second}} floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E

40|$|In literature, {{subnational}} {{governments have}} been identified as being prone to fiscal profligacy. In response to this problem, some countries choose to put a limit on the borrowing capacity of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and local <b>governments.</b> This is notably the case for Malaysia with the enactment of Article 111 (12) of the Constitution. However it remains to be answered whether such regulation really has an impact on the spending behavior of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments.</b> This paper attempts to shed some light on this question by employing the methodology usually found in the study of intertemporal behavior. The underlying objective is to examine whether a decision to further decentralize the economy in the future will not be translated into macroeconomic instability due to the fiscally irresponsible behavior of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments.</b> Indeed such eventuality can be avoided if the federal government has what it takes in order to put the spending behavior of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments</b> under control. Our findings point {{to the conclusion that the}} regulation has failed to produce a significant effect on the spending behavior of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>governments</b> in Malaysia manage to observe a forward looking behavior implying that they are not subject to any liquidity constraint. ...|$|R

5|$|Without the {{enactment}} of an appropriations bill, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> would not have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton {{would be forced to}} call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton's move to subvert the state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state's debt until <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>government</b> could resume its revenue collecting efforts.|$|E
