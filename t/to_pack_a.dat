5|$|The jamming {{operations}} were effective, {{but the decision}} <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> large number of aircraft into relatively small airspace made it certain that German night fighters would locate some aircraft. At this time, German policy was to commit only Experten to battle as they had the skill and experience to find and shoot down Allied bombers. The first fighters were being vectored onto their targets as the bombs began to fall on Ladbergen. Four pilots claimed all eight of the Lancasters lost on the raid out of a operating force of some 203 bombers. Geschwaderkommodore of NJG 4, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer claimed two; Hauptmann (Captain) Hermann Greiner claimed three; Hauptmann Josef Kraft claimed two, while Major Martin Drewes claimed one.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E

25|$|The E-3 was {{replaced}} by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Britain), which was different in some small details, most notably by using the modified 20mm MG-FF/M wing cannon and having improved head armour for the pilot. With the MG FF/M, it was possible to fire a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell'), which was made using drawn steel (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which had a larger cavity in which <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M designation.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} covered for American {{television}} series Glee by Kevin McHale, Chord Overstreet, Harry Shum, Jr., Samuel Larsen, and Damian McGinty in the episode titled [...] "Prom-asaurus". It was first aired on 8 May 2012, {{and is the}} 19th episode of the third season. Their characters Artie Abrams (McHale), Sam Evans (Overstreet), Mike Chang (Shum), Joe Hart (Larsen), and Rory Flanagan (McGinty), covered the song in the episode, performing a choreographed dance routine to it. Sarah Maloy of Billboard acknowledged, [...] "Screaming girls and choreographed boy band moves are, of course, in no short supply." [...] Maloy described Glees version as [...] "barely changing the sound or style of the original version." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "While One Direction's original manages <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> pop punch, Glees take kind of hits the mark. (Literally. The Glee boys prance across the stage in the same path as the U.K. heartthrobs.)" [...] Futterman concluded {{that it was the}} fourth best performance of that episode.

[...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink have the potential for much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But those days are gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it could still use a little less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements to the things they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|E
500|$|In the present, Ana Lucia starts {{questioning}} Henry Gale in the hatch, {{but suddenly}} he attacks her, {{and is only}} stopped when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) knocks him unconscious. Locke asks Henry why he attacked Ana Lucia, but has never tried to hurt him. Henry says that Locke is [...] "one of the good ones". Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia {{not to try to}} get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after she hands him the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with the blankets and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too. Michael then walks into the armory where Henry is being held. Instead of shooting Henry, Michael shoots himself in the arm.|$|E

The industrial killing by exhaust fumes was already tried and tested over several weeks at the Chełmno extermination camp in the then-Wartheland, {{under the guise of}} resettlement. All condemned Ghetto prisoners, without exception, were told they were going to labour camps, and asked <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>a</b> carry-on luggage. Many Jews believed in the transfer ruse, since deportations were also part of the ghettoization process. Meanwhile, the idea of mass murder by means of stationary gas chambers was discussed in Lublin already since September 1941. It was a precondition for the newly drafted Operation Reinhard led by Odilo Globocnik who ordered the construction of death camps at Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. At Majdanek and Auschwitz, the work of the stationary gas chambers began in March and May respectively, preceded by experiments with Zyklon B. Between 1942 and 1944, the most extreme measure of the Holocaust, the extermination of millions of Jews from Poland and all over Europe was carried out in six extermination camps. There were no Polish guards at any of the camps, despite the sometimes used misnomer Polish death camps. All killing centres were designed and operated by the Nazis in strict secrecy, aided by Trawnikis. Civilians were forbidden to approach them and often shot if caught near the train tracks.|$|E
