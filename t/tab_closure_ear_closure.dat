50|$|The {{cases were}} issued in pairs and worn {{at the front}} of the belt on either side of the buckle. Like all other M1956 {{equipment}} they were constructed of heavy canvas. The top flap was closed by means of a metal eyelet and cloth <b>tab</b> <b>closure.</b> Early models featured a steel plate at the front both to maintain rigidity and to protect the ammunition. Two hand grenades of any type in the US arsenal could be attached on either side of each pouch, with the spoon hooked through a web strap and another web strap with snap-closure wrapped around the top. Like other pouches in the system, the ammunition pouches each attached to the web belt with a pair of slide keepers and, uniquely, an adjustable length strap with a closable hook which connected to the rectangular hook on the suspenders, intended to keep the case upright and transfer some of the weight directly to the shoulders.|$|R

40|$|Background / Objective : To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media at our department over 3 years, between 2001 and 2003. The outcome measures were; achievement of dry <b>ear,</b> <b>closure</b> of tympanic membrane perforation and improvement in hearing for patients who had myringoplasty. Methods : A retrospective review of case notes of patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatomatous disease) operated upon by 2 consultant ENT surgeons in our department over a 3 year period. The operations performed were mastoidectomy and type I tympanoplasty or myringoplasty. The results were analysed and presented. Results : Seventy three patients were operated upon for cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media during this period, there were 41 males and 32 females with a sex ratio of 1 : 1. 3. Age range was 9 to 84 years with {{the mean age of}} 37 years. 17 of them were children aged 9 to 15 years (24 &#x 0025;). 25 patients (34. 2 &#x 0025;) had cholesteatoma and 48 (65. 8 &#x 0025;) had non-cholesteatomatous disease 41 (56. 2 &#x 0025;) had myringoplasty and 29 (39. 7 &#x 0025;) had mastoidectomy, and 3 (4. 1 &#x 0025;) patients had tympanomastoidectomy. 62. 5 &#x 0025; (n= 20) mastoid cavities were dry at 12 months follow up. Perforation closure was achieved in 89 &#x 0025; (n= 34). Binaural hearing was achieved in 6 patients and in 4 patients the operated ear became the better hearing ear; air-bone gap was closed completely in 8 patients (19. 5 &#x 0025;), and in 36. 6 &#x 0025; (n= 15) the gap was closed to within 10 dB. There was no deterioration in hearing in the operated ears. One patient presented with House Brachman grade 2 facial palsy pre-operatively which worsened to grade 4 post operatively but improved to pre-operative grade at 12 month follow up. Conclusion : Chronic suppurative otitis media is a disease that is still with us, and at our department, the surgery has a high success rate, which is also comparable in adults and children...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} {{and restoration}} of tissue mass after organ damage or injury in adult higher vertebrates {{is critical to}} the architecture and function of the organ. If replacement occurs with scar tissue, this often results in adverse effects on function and growth as well as an undesirable cosmetic appearance. However, certain mammals, such as the MRL/MpJ mouse, have shown a restricted capacity for regeneration, rather than scar tissue formation, after an excisional ear punch wound. To investigate the changes in tissue architecture leading to <b>ear</b> wound <b>closure,</b> initial <b>ear</b> wounding studies with a 2 -mm clinical biopsy punch were performed on MRL/MpJ mice, by using C 57 BL/ 6 mice as a nonregenerative control strain. In contrast to previously reported studies on mouse ear regeneration, we observed that C 57 BL/ 6 mice in fact showed a limited regenerative capacity. One explanation for this difference could be attributed to the method of wounding used; both previous studies on mouse ear regeneration used a thumb punch, whereas our approach was to use a clinical biopsy punch. This approach led us to further investigate whether the severity of trauma applied influenced the rate of wound healing. We, therefore, compared the effects of the sharp clinical biopsy punch with that of a cruder thumb punch, and introduced a third strain of mouse, Balb/c, known to be a slow-healing strain. A new method to quantify <b>ear</b> punch hole <b>closure</b> was developed and a histologic investigation conducted up to 4 months after wounding. Image analysis data showed a reduction in original ear wound area of 85 % in MRL/MpJ mice at 4 weeks and of 91. 7 % over 4 months by using a biopsy punch. In contrast, the crude thumb punch methodology resulted in an increase in wound area of up to 58 % in Balb/c ears; thought to be due to increased necrosis of the wound site. All biopsy-punched wound areas plateaued in healing between days 28 and 112. Only 5 of 80 MRL/MpJ mouse ears showed no residual holes macroscopically after 28 days. Histologically, all strains of mice healed their ear wounds in a similar manner involving re-epithelialization, blastema-like formation, dermal extension, blood vessel formation, chondrogenesis, folliculogenesis, and skeletal muscle and fat differentiation. However, all regenerative features were more pronounced and accelerated in MRL/MpJ mice when compared with C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c biopsy-punched mouse ears...|$|R
40|$|Round {{holes in}} the ears of MRL mice tend to close with {{characteristics}} of regeneration believed to be absent in other mouse strains (e. g., C 57 BL/ 6). We evaluated the kinetics and the histopathology of <b>ear</b> wound <b>closure</b> in young (8 weeks old) C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice. We also used middle-aged (40 weeks old) C 57 BL/ 6 mice to evaluate the influence of aging on this process. A circular through-and-through hole {{was made in the}} ear, photographs were taken at different times after injury and wound area was measured with digital analysis software. The percentages of closed area measured on day 100 were: 23. 57 ± 8. 66 % for young BALB/c mice, 56. 47 ± 7. 39 % for young C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and 75. 31 ± 23. 65 % for middle-aged C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Mice were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 25, 44, and 100 for histological evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin, Gomori&# 8217;s trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff, or picrosirius red staining. In young mice of both strains, healing included re-epithelialization, chondrogenesis, myogenesis, and collagen deposition. Young C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice differed in the organization of collagen fibers visualized using picrosirius-polarization. Sebaceous glands and hair follicles regenerated and chondrogenesis was greater in young C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In middle-aged C 57 BL/ 6 mice all aspects of regeneration were depressed. The characteristics of regeneration were present during ear wound healing in both young BALB/c and young C 57 BL/ 6 mice although they differed in intensity and pattern. Greater <b>ear</b> wound <b>closure</b> in middle-aged C 57 BL/ 6 mice was not correlated with regeneration...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of the patient {{encumbered}} with several congenital defects of the ear or who has insufficient autologous cartilage to harvest, it might be infeasible to effect the corrections with grafts of rib cartilage. In such a case, the reconstructive Antia-Buch helical advancement technique might apply; it moves tissues from behind the ear rim, and then around and forward to repair the defective front of the ear rim. To perform the Antia-Buch helical advancement, with ink, the surgeon first designs the incision inside the helical rim and around the crus (shank) of the helix. Then cuts the skin and the cartilage — but does not pierce the posterior skin of the ear. The helical rim then is advanced to allow the suturing (closure), and a dog-ear-shaped graft of skin is removed {{from the back of the}} <b>ear.</b> The <b>closure</b> of the sutures advances the crus of the helix into the helical rim.|$|R

40|$|Therapeutic {{angiogenesis}} is a {{major goal}} ofregenerative medicine, but no clinically approved small molecule exists that enhancesnew blood vessel formation. Here we show, using a phenotype-driven high-content imaging screen of an annotated chemical library of 1280 bioactive small molecules, that the retinoid agonist Tazarotene, enhances in vitroangiogenesis, promoting branching morphogenesis, and tubule remodeling. The pro-angiogenic phenotype is mediated by Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) but not Retinoic X Receptor(RXR) activation, and is characterized by secretion of the pro-angiogenic factors Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGFA), Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU) and Placental Growth Factor (PGF), and reduced secretion of the antiangiogenic factor Pentraxin- 3 (PTX 3) from adjacent fibroblasts. In vivo, Tazarotene enhanced the growth of mature and functional microvessels in Matrigel implants and wound healing models, and increased blood flow. Notably, in ear punch wound healing model, Tazarotene promoted tissue repair characterized by rapid <b>ear</b> punch <b>closure</b> with normal-appearing skin containing new hair follicles, and maturing collagen fibers. Our study suggests that Tazarotene, an FDA-approved small molecule, could be potentially exploited for therapeutic applications in neovascularization and wound healing...|$|R
40|$|The loss of TGFβ or its {{downstream}} mediator, Smad 3, {{key players}} in tissue repair, accelerates closure of incisional wounds in mice. In contrast, we now report that excisional ear wounds in mice lacking Smad 3 enlarge compared with wild-type controls resulting from changes in extracellular matrix molecules, which alter the mechanotransduction properties of these wounds. Specifically, levels of elastin and glycosoaminoglycans are increased, collagen fibers are more compactly organized, and matrix modulators like integrins, TGFβ 1, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are altered both basally and after wounding in Smad 3 knockout mice. Mechanical testing of dorsal skin correlates these changes in matrix composition with functional parameters, specifically an increased elastic modulus, suggesting an imbalance of tissue forces. We propose that the altered mechanical elastic properties translate into a persistent retractile force that is opposed by decreased wound contractile forces contributing to the enlarging ear wound in Smad 3 knockout mice. These studies highlight a previously undescribed role for Smad 3 in the mechanotransduction of matrix unsupported <b>ear</b> wound <b>closure...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{number of}} {{patients}} with stapes otosclerosis compared {{to the number of}} otorhinolaryngologists has declined over the past several years. As a result a controversy has arisen in the literature, whether or not stapes surgery should be included in residency programs. Aim: the objective of the present study is to evaluate the results and complications of estapedotomies performed by residents between January, 1997 and January, 2000, and consequently study the feasibility of including estapedotomies in residency programs. Study design: retrospective review of prospectively collected audiometric data. Materials and methods: fifty charts of patients that were submitted to a total of 51 primary stapedotomies were reviewed mainly for complications and audiological results. Results: there was closure of the air-bone gap within 10 dB HL in 70. 5 % of <b>ears</b> and <b>closure</b> to within 20 dB HL in 86. 3 % of ears. There was one ear with total hearing loss (2 %).

The objective of our {{study was to determine}} their influence on pain, stress and well-being in the mare, by evaluating heart rate, breath rate, facial expression changes and salivary cortisol before, during and after puncture. For this experiment, 21 pony mares were used. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspirations were performed on 11 mares. After injections for sedation, analgesia and antispasmodia, the follicles from both ovaries were aspirated with a needle introduced through the vagina wall into the ovary. In the control group, 10 mares underwent similar treatments and injections, but no follicular aspiration. Along the session, heart rate and breath rate were evaluated by a trained veterinarian, <b>ears</b> position, eyelid <b>closure</b> and contraction of facial muscles were evaluated and salivary samples were taken for evaluation of cortisol concentration. A significant relaxation was observed after sedative injection in the punctured and control mares, according to <b>ear</b> position, eyelid <b>closure</b> and contraction of facial muscles, but no difference between punctured and control animals was recorded. No significant modification of salivary cortisol concentration during puncture and no difference between punctured and control mares at any time were observed. No significant modification of the breath rate was observed along the procedure for the punctured and the control mares. Heart rate increased significantly but transiently when the needle was introduced in the ovary and was significantly higher at that time for the punctured mares compared to control mares. None of the other investigated parameters were affected at that time, suggesting discomfort is minimal and transient. Improving analgesia, for example through a multimodal approach, during that possibly more sensitive step could be recommended. The evaluation of facial expression changes and heart rate are easy-to-use and accurate tools to evaluate pain and well-being of the mare...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the outcomes of myringoplasties in Aboriginal children and to identify factors associated with a successful outcome with the use of prospective case series from primary health care clinics and hospitals in four rural and remote regions of Western Australia. All 58 Aboriginal children, aged 5 – 15 years, who underwent 78 myringoplasties between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2001 were included in the study. Complete postoperative (post-op) follow-up was achieved following 78 % of myringoplasties. The main outcome measures were (a) success, i. e. an intact tympanic membrane and normal hearing six or more months post-op in the operated <b>ear,</b> (b) <b>closure</b> of the perforation, (c) Post-op hearing improvement. Forty-nine per cent of myringoplasties were successful, 72 % resulted in closure or reduction in the size of the perforation and 51 % resulted in hearing improvement. After controlling for age, sex, clustering and number of previous myringoplasties, no association was observed between success or hearing improvement and perforation size, or the presence of serous aural discharge at the time of surgery. Myringoplasty resulted in hearing improvement and/or perforation closure in a significant proportion of children. Thus, primary school-aged Aboriginal children in whom conservative management of chronic suppurative otitis media has been unsuccessful should have access to myringoplasty because of the positive impact on their socialization, language and learning that results from improved hearing...|$|R
40|$|A {{multicentre}} {{prospective trial}} was commenced in July 1984 {{to establish the}} incidence of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children born with a cleft of the palate.

Eighty percent of control ears had persistent OME during a 24 -month follow-up period post palatal repair. It would seem that OME is universally present in children with a cleft palate prior to 4 months of age and this incidence is only marginally diminished by palatal surgery.

40|$|Animals {{capable of}} {{regenerating}} multiple tissue types, organs, and appendages after injury are common yet sporadic and include some sponge, hydra, planarian, and salamander (i. e., newt and axolotl) species, but notably such regenerative capacity {{is rare in}} mammals. The adult MRL mouse strain is a rare {{exception to the rule}} that mammals do not regenerate appendage tissue. Certain commonalities, such as blastema formation and basement membrane breakdown at the wound site, suggest that MRL mice may share other features with classical regenerators. As reported here, MRL fibroblast-like cells have a distinct cell-cycle (G 2 /M accumulation) phenotype and a heightened basal and wound site DNA damage/repair response that is also common to classical regenerators and mammalian embryonic stem cells. Additionally, a neutral and alkaline comet assay displayed a persistent level of intrinsic DNA damage in cells derived from the MRL mouse. Similar to mouse ES cells, the p 53 -target p 21 was not expressed in MRL ear fibroblasts. Because the p 53 /p 21 axis plays {{a central role in the}} DNA damage response and cell cycle control, we directly tested the hypothesis that p 21 down-regulation could functionally induce a regenerative response in an appendage of an otherwise nonregenerating mouse strain. Using the <b>ear</b> hole <b>closure</b> phenotype, a genetically mapped and reliable quantitative indicator of regeneration in the MRL mouse, we show that the unrelated Cdkn 1 atmi/Tyj/J p 21 −/− mouse (unlike the B 6129 SF 2 /J WT control) closes ear holes similar to MRL mice, providing a firm link between cell cycle checkpoint control and tissue regeneration...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} evaluation of glass ionomer cement (GIC) in middle ear surgery {{with emphasis on}} short- and long-term safety was conducted at the tertiary referral center. GIC was applied between 1995 and 2006 in 444 patients in otologic surgery. Technical aspects, safety, benefits and complications due to GIC were analysed until 2011 (follow-up 5 - 16  years; mean 10  years). GIC was applied in stapes surgery (228 primary, 92 revisions), cochlear implants (108) and implantable hearing aids (7), ossiculoplasty (7), for coverage of opened mastoid air cells towards the external ear canal (1) and inner <b>ear</b> fistula <b>closure</b> (1). GIC {{turned out to be}} very handy in stapes surgery for optimal prosthesis fixation at the incus (260) and on the malleus handle (60) without complications. Results suggest that GIC may diminish the danger of incus necrosis in primary stapedotomy. In cochlear implants and implantable hearing aids, GIC was used for casing alone (74), casing and electrode fixation (27) and electrode alone fixation (14). Inflammatory reactions were observed in five cases (4. 3  %), mostly after trauma. Broken cement fragments appeared to promote foreign body rejection. In seven cases an incudo-stapedial gap was repaired with GIC with excellent hearing gain; in three cases (43  %) revision surgery was needed due to cement breakage. In one case, GIC was applied for a watertight coverage of opened mastoid cells, and in the other for fistula closure of the lateral semi-circular canal over cartilage, covered with bone pathé; follow-up was uneventful. Targeted use of GIC in middle ear surgery rarely poses problems. GIC cannot be used in neuro-otosurgery in contact with cerebrospinal fluid because of possible aluminium encephalopathy...|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} achieved {{in the development of}} small molecules that produce a critical step of limb regeneration: cellularization in mammalian muscle tissue. Recent research indicates that apoptotic signaling without full progression to apoptosis is a significant stage of regeneration in salamanders. Therefore, focusing on small molecules that induce apoptosis in muscle, such as doxorubicin [36], could provide new candidate compounds for initiating cellularization. However, it is also apparent that major technical hurdles remain before there is any possibility of completely regenerating mammalian limb tissues. For example, the cellularization process has been recapitulated in mammalian myotubes, but there is no data to suggest that this can be reproduced in fully differentiated mature muscle fibers, which are thicker and striated with contractile proteins. Moreover, small molecule-induced cellularization has only been reported for mouse myotubes. There is no report about the effectiveness of this methodology in human muscle tissue. Finally, there is no established animal model for testing the potential for these small molecules to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo. The p 21 Cip 1 knockout mouse shows appendage regeneration with the <b>closure</b> of <b>ear</b> punctures [37]. It could be envisaged that small molecules which induce myotube cellularization by targeting p 21 Cip 1 could be tested in an ear punch model using genetically normal mice. Overall, numerous small molecules have been developed that induce a key step of salamander limb regeneration, cellularization, in mammalian muscle tissue. Unfortunately, research progress is stalled at in vitro analyses of myotubes derived from rodent tissues. Further studies of these molecules in vivo using animal models and confirmation of their effects in human tissues are required to assess their potential to regenerate tissues that have been lost to injury or disease.|$|R

In the studies described in chapter 2, the most economical patterns {{with regard to}} extra skin waste, scar length and vertex angle were investigated. A comparison of minimum waste area showed that the best patterns were the rhomboid and the mosque excision. The second comparison of the scar length showed that the length was almost independent of the pattern. The third comparison showed that the rhomboid and the S-shape patterns possessed the smallest vertex angles and thus minimized the formation of dog ear. Interestingly, the common surgical ellipse was observed {{not to have any}} advantage in any of the cut pattern categories. The currently held paradigm that the vertex angle of a surgical ellipse should be 30 ° or less for length-to-width ratios of lower than 4 was found to be mathematically incorrect. The circular excision pattern, i. e. a direct excision of a round lesion, was found superior to other patterns that were examined in that there was no skin waste and that the resulting scar length was the shortest.
