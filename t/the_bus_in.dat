5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the}} same as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E

5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E

25|$|An initial {{investigation}} {{showed that}} a tree fell down on the road, trapping <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> a fireball. According to Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, after the vehicle caught fire, the driver was injured and lost control. While performing a U-turn on the narrow road the bus caught fire and the cadets tried to escape the burning vehicle. The back door would not open due to the extreme heat but was eventually broken through, enabling some cadets to flee the burning bus; however, those who fled encountered the intense blaze outside. An officer and two cadets were able to escape and were {{picked up by a}} passing motorist, who then drove through the fire to safety. Most of the IPS officers and cadets had been in their 20s and 30s, and several were Druze. The incident is the country's deadliest single peacetime event involving security forces.|$|E

25|$|Resigning in January 1819, Jones was {{replaced}} by Langdon Cheves who continued the contraction in credit {{in an effort to}} stop inflation and stabilize the bank, even as the economy began to correct. The central bank's reaction to the crisis—a clumsy expansion, then a sharp contraction of credit—indicated its weakness, not its strength. The effects were catastrophic, resulting in a protracted recession with mass unemployment and a sharp drop in property values that persisted until 1822. The financial crisis raised doubts among the American public as to the efficacy of paper money, and in whose interests a national system of finance operated. Upon this widespread disaffection the anti-bank Jacksonian Democrats would mobilize opposition to <b>the</b> <b>BUS</b> <b>in</b> the 1830s. The national bank was in general disrepute among most Americans when Nicholas Biddle, the third and last president of the bank, was appointed by President James Monroe in 1823.|$|E

The inmate was handcuffed by one wrist to another inmate, but he was able to, without any prison employee noticing, remove the cuffs and free himself.

500|$|For the show's 100th episode, [...] "Mercy", which {{aired on}} October 22, 2017, {{executive}} producers Greg Nicotero and Scott M. Gimple {{wanted to create}} callbacks to this episode.

For this, they recast Addy Miller, now a teenager, as a walker that threatens Rick and Carl. They also recast Joe Giles, who plays one of the walkers that followed Rick off <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta, as a walker in [...] "Mercy".

A single tear rolls down her cheek and the video ends.|$|E
500|$|The riots spawned from a bar raid {{became a}} literal example of {{gays and lesbians}} {{fighting}} back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of [...] "exploitation and degradation". The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the [...] "ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality". Historian Nicholas Edsall writes, Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December 2013, {{the anniversary}} of the attack, activists held {{memorials}} throughout New Delhi in memory of the victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning [...] "fearless".

University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where Nirbhaya and her friend, Pandey, boarded <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>in</b> which the rape and beatings took place. At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: [...] "...whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future". [...] The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe [...] "has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them".|$|E
