40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{competitiveness}} on the global market the major objective of the world olive growing industry {{seems to be the}} reduction of the production costs and the increase of the number of olive trees per hectare. The production cost analysis indicates that harvesting is of utmost importance. As a result it is important to mechanize and innovate the harvesting process. Using olive harvesting mechanization systems it is necessary both to reduce the production costs and {{to improve the quality of}} the olives and subsequently of the oil. In the order of increasing importance and cost of the machine, the following olive harvesting mechanization systems are used in high density orchards: hand held shaker or <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> with different interceptor systems. Various tests have been done on the different harvesting systems to compare the fruit removal efficiency and work productivity. Our results have demonstrated that the work productivity increases when the harvesting mechanization systems are used and that productivity increases proportionally to the power of the mechanization systems. When the hand held shaker is used the work productivity is doubled, compared with harvesting by hand. However, it is important to note that the hand held shaker is only suitable for sloping or terracing ground and small family run farms. Other tests were carried out in high density orchard (200 - 300 trees/hectare) using the <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> system. Our test results have demonstrated that if the <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> machine is used the work productivity increases and the degree of improvement depends on the different interceptor systems ranging from the nets to the reverse umbrella. The conclusion drawn from the tests results is that all the harvesting mechanization systems reduce the production costs of the olives and increase the work productivity, improving the competitiveness on the global market...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed to study whether the {{application}} of ethephon as an abscission agent and mechanical harvest using a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> {{have any effect on}} plant water status, leaf gas exchange, and yield of mandarin and orange trees cultivated under Mediterranean conditions. The experiment was performed from 2008 to 2011 in five commercial orchards where parameters related to the plant water status and leaf gas exchange were measured before {{the application of}} ethephon, at harvest time and at different occasions after harvest. In addition, the effects of ethephon dose on yield in the current and subsequent seasons were also evaluated. Results showed that ethephon applications and mechanical harvest did not detrimentally affect plant water status in any of the cultivars studied. Furthermore, either had no effect or had a short temporal decrease effect on leaf gas exchange depending on the cultivar studied although with no consequences for the fruit yield obtained during the current season. Increasing ethephon doses led to fruit yield reductions in the mandarin ‘Orogrande’ trees in subsequent seasons. When trunk-shaker and ethephon applications were combined, however, yields from the late-maturing orange significantly decline in subsequent seasons. Overall, results show that using a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> is a viable technique to mechanically harvest citrus trees destined to both fresh and industry market and can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} traditional manual harvest usually performed under Mediterranean conditions. However, its use cannot be recommended for late-maturing oranges, such as the ‘Navel Lane Late’ in which mature fruit and fruitlets coexist in the tree at the time of harvest...|$|E
40|$|Spain {{ranks as}} the world’s leading {{exporter}} of citrus for fresh consumption. Manual harvest accounts for 50 % of the total production costs. Mechanical harvest would increase labor productivity and benefits of growers. Efficiency of these machines depends on the varieties and operating conditions. Use of abscission chemicals has been promoted to increase the detachment rate of fruit without affecting its quality. This work is aimed at studying whether the mechanical harvest and/or the application of an abscission agent affect {{the quality and quantity}} of harvested fruit and tree defoliation under the conditions of citrus cultivation in Spain. Trials were made in a completely randomized experimental design. From 2008 to 2011, different orchards of mandarin and orange trees were sprayed with different doses of ethephon as abscission agent and harvested with a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker.</b> Harvest related variables (detachment percentage, defoliation and fruit without calyx) were measured. The percentage of fruit detached by the <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> ranged between 70 and 85 % and it did not depend on the orchard. The shaker produced minimal damage to the bark when gripped incorrectly. Increased doses of ethephon increased fruit detachment except in ‘Clemenules’ orchard, but also increased the fruit without calyx in 1 - 9 %. Moreover, ethephon promoted significant defoliation. Neither gummosis nor death of branches was observed. This work demonstrates that mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers may be a feasible solution for citrus cultivated in Spain for fresh market. Use of ethephon could only be recommended for citrus destined to industry and only for certain varieties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trunk</b> <b>shakers</b> {{are among}} the most {{widespread}} machines for mechanical harvesting in intensive olive orchards (300 – 500  trees ha− 1). Harvesting effectiveness is an important issue for this sort of machine because, due to the heterogeneity of the tree canopy structure, vibration transmission is uneven and some branches vibrate poorly. The aim of the present work was to determine if the removal of internal suckers before harvesting could improve vibration transmission and harvesting effectiveness. ‘Leccino’ and ‘Frantoio’ trees trained to free vase and planted in an intensive olive orchard (400  trees ha− 1) were used in experiments carried out in 2012 and 2013 in two different orchards. Triaxial accelerometers, placed on tree trunk and on the main branches, were used to measure vibration transmitted to the canopy by two custom-built orbital and multidirectional <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers.</b> On average, harvesting effectiveness increased significantly from 83. 4 % to 95. 6 % as a consequence of sucker removal. Maximum acceleration transmitted to the trunk and branches increased by 33. 1 % and 46. 6 % respectively after internal sucker removal. These results suggest that internal suckers reduce vibration transmission through the canopy, affecting harvesting effectiveness. Furthermore, the larger the fruit retention force per fruit mass was, the larger was the effect of sucker removal on harvesting effectiveness. These results suggests that sucker removal prior to harvesting is advisable to improve harvesting effectiveness in open vase trees harvested by <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers,</b> in particular when mechanical harvesting is carried out at an early stage of fruit ripening...|$|R

40|$|Low input {{management}} {{of a high}} density olive orchard is presented here and implications on olive oil yield and quality discussed. The young olive orchard yielded abundantly (about 1 t of oil per hectare) despite the minimum input criteria that were followed in irrigation, fertilization, and pruning. Grass cover, minimum pruning, deficit irrigation strategies not only proved sustainable but also compatible with top quality oil production and mechanical harvesting. Minimum pruning techniques allowed to keep pruning to less than 45 min over the 10 -year period, which included the training phase and the onset of fruit production. Yield of deficit irrigated trees was 84 % of fully irrigated trees; rainfed trees produced 63 % of fully-irrigated trees. Soil water availability strongly influenced phenolic concentration of olive oil. Yield to mechanical harvesting by <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers</b> was greater than 90 % for ‘Frantoio’ and ‘Leccino’, between 85 and 91 % for ‘Pendolino’, and less than 88 and 80 % for ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Moraiolo’, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Umbrella pine cone {{production}} {{is an important}} forest non-wood product in Portugal,especially {{in the region of}} Alcácer do Sal, where it plays an important role to the local development. Traditionally umbrella pine cones are manually harvested, increasing production costs and, above all, with very high accident risk to the workers. The development of equipment for mechanical harvesting started in Italy in the 1980 's. Studies report different values for harvesting efficiency and tree damage, the latter in terms of immature cones and branches detached. In this study a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> was used to evaluate mechanical harvesting both in terms of efficiency and tree damage induced by trunk vibration. In comparison to the manual process, time required for mechanised harvesting was about 1 / 15 th of the time. The results revealed a mechanical harvesting efficiency higher than 86 % with negligible tree damage. Inter-annual harvest efficiency variability was also observed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Because {{of damage}} caused by {{mechanical}} harvesting, the drupes for table olive production are traditionally hand harvested. Until now, no data have been available on the microbiological and chemical features of mechanically harvested drupes during fermentation. Results: Drupes mechanically harvested and inoculated with Lactobacillus pentosus OM 13 were characterized by the lowest concentrations of potential spoilage microorganisms. On the other hand, drupes mechanically harvested and subjected to spontaneous fermentation showed the highest concentration of Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonads during transformation. The lowest decrease of pH (4. 20) was registered for the trials inoculated with the starter culture. Differences in terms of volatile organic compounds were estimated among trials. Multivariate analysis showed that the olives processed from the drupes mechanically harvested and inoculated with starter were closely related to control production (drupes manually harvested) in terms of microbiological and pH values. Sensory analysis evidenced negative evaluations only for the uninoculated trials. Conclusion: Drupes mechanically harvested and subjected to a driven fermentation with Lactobacillus pentosus OM 13 determined the production of table olives with appreciable organoleptic features. Thus mechanical harvesting performed using a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> equipped with an inverse umbrella {{and the addition of}} starter lactic acid bacteria represents a valuable alternative to manual harvesting for table olive production at the industrial level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen and how harvest olives {{are among}} the most {{important}} issues to improve quality and quantity to ensure the best net return to growers. <b>Trunk</b> <b>shakers</b> are commonly used in mechanical harvesting to detach olives. Field trials showed that with this equipment less than 100 % of the production is detached, usually 70 % to 90 % (Michelakis, 2002). It is important to increase the percentage of fruits harvested, to reduce losses. To achieve this goal factors affecting mechanical olive harvesting must be known, {{to be used in the}} definition of harvest season. Some of these factors are the result of the orchard management, like tree shape, canopy density, pruning methods. Others depend on the cultivar, such as fruit removal force (FRF), fruit weight (P) and the ratio between them. FRF and P are considered decisive in the detachment process. Results of field trials carried out in the Northeast of Portugal with “Cobrançosa Transmontana” cultivar show the FRF, P and their ratio evolution in the ripening period. They have potential to become indicators of the mechanical olive harvest season...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{orchards}} (from 100 to 300 trees/ha) still {{represents the}} vast majority of Italian olive orchards. They present problems because often their yields are low and production costs are high. This situation pushes to a renovation of the sector through the establishment of new olive orchards which allow high yields and mechanization of cultural practices, particularly harvesting. This can be done using two main orchard designs, the intensive and superintensive ones, with the former that is well known and experienced and the latter that has been recently introduced. Intensive olive orchards consist of 200 to 400 trees/ha and are designed to be harvested with <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers.</b> Superintensive olive orchards range 1000 - 2500 trees/ha and are designed to be harvested with continuous straddle machines. Moreover, high density olive orchards, with tree densities comprised between those of intensive and superintensive orchards, have been proposed and are under evaluation. In the present work we report detailed information on requirements and technical aspects related to the establishment and management of intensive and superintensive olive orchards, along with the description of their main advantages and disadvantages, to allow growers to choose their best option based on farm size, available capitals and labour, and commercial targets.

40|$|The pruning {{of olive}} (Olea europaea L.) trees is an {{expensive}} practice in olive growing. In this paper {{we report on the}} 20 year performance of an olive orchard managed by coppicing. This alternative method was developed to minimize pruning costs and simplify orchard management. Trees were planted at 6 x 6 m distance in spring 1969 and trained to a vasebush by regular annual pruning until spring 1980, when the orchard was divided into 10 plots of about 20 trees each and all trees in one plot were cut off at ground level. In the following years coppicing was extended to one additional plot per year until 1989. In 1990 the plot first coppiced in 1980 was coppiced again to begin a second cycle of coppicing. During the 10 years of each cycle, pruning was limited to the elimination of a few suckers in the centre of the canopy on the third year after coppicing. Thus, the coppiced system required a maximum of 14 min/plant of pruning over 10 years corresponding to 6. 5 h ha(- 1) year(- 1) of unskilled labour. The onset of fruit production occurred the third or the fourth year after coppicing. Fruit yield of the coppiced orchard was 85 % of that of an adjacent orchard trained to vasebush (control). Alternate bearing was less in the coppiced orchard than in the control orchard. No effect of coppicing was found on fruit or oil quality, or occurrence of pests and diseases. The coppicing method is not only suitable to rejuvenate old olive trees but also to manage orchards sustainably at a minimum cost for pruning. The main disadvantage is the unsuitability for mechanical harvesting by <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers</b> because the plant canopy is formed by multiple stems...|$|R
40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} of table olives to mechanical damage limits mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers. The {{objective of this}} study was the identification, evaluation and temporal evolution assessment of the sources of damage caused to the fruits. To do this, digital image analysis was used for the objective determination of damage produced to table olives. Harvesting tests were performed in an intensive olive orchard with trees of the ‘Manzanilla’ variety in Seville, Spain. Mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers and subsequent detachment of the fruits to the ground produced a level of interference 12 times greater than the levels obtained from manual harvesting. Fruit-fruit and fruit-branch impacts and friction from the movement of the fruit in the tree canopy during vibration and detachment were the main causes of damage to the fruits. These causes represented a mean value of 60 % of the damage produced to the fruits from mechanical harvesting. In addition, most bruising from mechanical damage occurred in the first hour after harvesting and followed an exponential tendency. The information obtained about table olive damage causes and bruise time evolution during fruit detachment with <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> can be used by the producers to determine how to reduce and prevent bruising during harvesting operations...|$|E
40|$|The fruit {{harvesting}} {{is a key}} factor involving both product quality and profitability. Particularly, mechanical harvesting of traditional oil olive orchards is hint by tree training system for manual harvesting, tree size and several and slanted trunks which makes difficult <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker</b> work. Therefore, canopy shaker technology could be a feasible alternative to develop an integral harvester able to work on irregular canopies. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine vibration parameters applied to the olive tree for efficient mechanical harvesting by canopy shaker measuring fruit removal efficiency and debris. In this work, a continuous lateral canopy shaker harvester has been developed and tested on large olive trees in order to analyse the operating harvester parameters and tree properties to improve mutual adaptation. Vibration amplitude and frequency, rod density and ground speed were assessed. Vibration amplitude and frequency beside ground speed were decisive factors on fruit removal efficiency. Increasing rod density has not influenced on removal efficiency although it increased significantly debris. Promising results has been reached with 77. 3 % of removal efficiency, applying a 28 s shaking duration, 0. 17 m amplitude vibration and 12 rod drum. This result was obtained reporting 0. 26 s of accumulative shaking time over 200 m/s 2 resultant acceleration. The canopy shaker mechanism enabled more than 65 % of detached fruits to fall vertically, facilitating catch fruit. In order to improve removal efficiency it is advisable to adapt trees, set high amplitude in the shaker mechanism, and enhance the contact time between rods and tree...|$|E
40|$|In Portugal, olive (Olea europaea L.) groves {{with the}} {{traditional}} tree density of around 100 trees ha - 1, necessitate increasing pruning costs every year. As a result farmers tend to lengthen pruning intervals. With the purpose of studying a mechanised alternative to the expensive, labor-intensive manual pruning practice, the authors established in 1997 field trials with the following three treatments: i) manual pruning with a chain saw; ii) mechanical pruning, performed by a tractor mounted cutting bar provided with 6 circular disc-saws; and iii) mechanical pruning, as in the mechanical pruning treatment, followed by a manual pruning complement. The effect of the above treatments on olive production and on harvesting efficiency was evaluated every year for 8 yr. The harvesting was performed by a <b>trunk</b> <b>shaker,</b> and the remaining non-detached fruits were collected manually. The pruning rate of mechanical pruning (487 trees hour- 1 man- 1) was substantially higher than the values of manual pruning and mechanical+manual pruning, which were the same (20 trees hour- 1 man- 1). Over the 8 -yr period, mechanical pruning had an average yield of 36, 4 kg tree- 1 year- 1 which {{was significantly higher than}} the 30, 1 kg tree- 1 year- 1 of manual pruning and no significantly different from the 34, 1 kg tree- 1 year- 1 of mechanical+manual pruning. The shaker efficiency was significantly influenced by the year, ranging from 72 % to 96 %; {{no significant differences were found}} between treatments in terms of harvesting efficiency. These tests indicate that after mechanized pruning (horizontal cut at the uppermost part of the canopy) trees can be kept for at least 8 years without any significant loss in olive yield per tree and no effect in harvesting efficiency, therefore reducing costs. Selective manual complement to the mechanized pruning, performed in the same year, does not provide any further advantages in olive yield nor in shaker performance and consequently increasing production costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{automation}} {{of fruit}} harvesting operations {{has become an}} important area of research in trying to improve {{the efficiency of the}} harvesting operation as well as to minimize the costs associated with manual labor. A need to improve safety, {{especially when it comes to}} harvesting fruits from hard to reach spaces has been another reason for increasing research in the area of robotics applied to harvesting operations. The automation solutions applied to citrus harvesting can be broadly categorized into Mass harvesters (canopy or <b>trunk</b> <b>shakers)</b> and Selective harvesters (robot manipulator arms). While several designs of mass harvesters have been developed, they cannot be employed in cases where the fruit is to be harvested with minimum damage, for example, in the fresh fruit industry or where damage to the tree canopy or trunk is to be avoided. These issues necessitate the research of selective harvesting mechanisms, e. g. robotic manipulators to selectively harvest fruits with little or no damage to the fruit and tree and to efficiently automate the harvesting process. Robotic manipulators have traditionally been driven by means of hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical motors or a combination of these and different control system strategies exist for these implementations. The thesis aims to design linear and nonlinear controllers for a hydraulic robot and to lay out a framework for real-time implementation of the controllers for position control in fruit harvesting operations. The mechanical, electrical and hydraulic components layout of a manipulator - a 4 degree of freedom (DOF) robot, is studied for proper design of control system strategies to be employed. Owing to the inherent nonlinear behavior of hydraulic components, including the control valves and rotary actuators as well as the mechanical system comprising of the joints and links of the manipulator, a detailed study and characterization of the entire manipulator system is crucial for ensuring acceptable performance of the controllers. Based on the mathematical model of the electro-hydro-mechanical system of the manipulator, linear and nonlinear control systems are designed for trajectory tracking and position control. A framework for implementing the control systems in real time is designed and the hardware and software packages necessary for a hardware-in-loop implementation of the control system are set up. Simulations and results from the real-time implementation are then used to discuss the stability and performance metrics of the different control strategies...|$|R

Many commercial tree shakers use stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheels to dislodge the crop from the tree by attaching and shaking the <b>trunk.</b> Tree <b>shakers</b> are known to cause tree trunk damage by approach impact, barking, and bruising of the tree trunk. Tree trunk damage, catastrophic or accumulative, could account for a 4 % lifetime production loss, 1408 kg/hectare.;The energy-wheels are commonly known to create planer pulse forces. The pulse is created by the rotation of eccentric mass about a fixed common shaft. The frequency and magnitude of the force {{is determined by the}} weight, angular velocity, and center of gravity location of each energy wheel. The industry has developed pads and slings to conform to the tree trunk and transmit the force while minimizing the potential for trunk damage. Lubrication of the slings reduces the coefficient of friction and allows unwanted force dissipation. Lubrication of the slings reduce the transfer of non-normal forces.;This research discloses the presence of moments and extends the planer equations to allow analysis of moment magnitudes and the introduction of planer losses in the y-axis. Moments and planer forces are always present in stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheel systems. Moments are non-normal forces and are dissipated in the slings, pads, shaker head suspension system. Moments and y-axis losses reduce the efficiency of the system and require additional hardware and systems to control adverse effects on the tree trunk.;Understanding the magnitude of moments will allow development of new systems to extend the application of mechanical shakers to other crops and applications...|$|R
