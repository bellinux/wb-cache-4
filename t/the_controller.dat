5|$|<b>The</b> <b>controller</b> {{is central}} to the correct {{function}} of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> has to complete.|$|E
5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to <b>the</b> <b>controller,</b> <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> and then return the results. <b>The</b> <b>controller</b> assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying <b>the</b> <b>controller,</b> although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only <b>the</b> <b>controller,</b> each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

5|$|By October 1951, the {{estimated}} completion date for Victoriouss modernisation {{was already a}} year past the initial estimate of April 1954. Implacable was scheduled to begin her modernisation in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA Girdle Ness were delayed. <b>The</b> <b>Controller</b> of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. <b>The</b> <b>Controller</b> ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding Implacable between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require about three-quarters of the structural work of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for Victorious by herself) would delay work on both ships. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of structural work, the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship's new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3"/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that Victorious would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that the process would take longer and cost more than was practicable.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [98]- 99) The {{comparative study}} between the Proportional Integral Derivative <b>controller,</b> <b>the</b> Fuzzy Logic <b>controller</b> and <b>the</b> Fuzzy Supervisory <b>controller,</b> shows <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> Fuzzy <b>controllers</b> over <b>the</b> P-ID <b>controller.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this}} thesis is to design a temperature controller using different methods and do a relative study of the results.

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> were to {{background}} {{garbage collect}} {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell <b>the</b> <b>controller</b> this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of <b>the</b> <b>controller.</b> Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming <b>the</b> <b>controller,</b> players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E
