500|$|After {{months of}} rumours, the new {{attraction}} was announced by Universal officials on March 19, 2008. Unlike usual announcements, {{officials did not}} reveal the specifications of the entire roller coaster. In the original press release, it stated that the roller coaster's vertical lift hill would be [...] tall, and that the trains would reach a maximum speed of [...] The press release also mentioned that each train would be equipped with a multi-media package, LED lights, built in video recorders, and the option for riders to choose a song from a list to be played {{during the course of}} the ride. The ride would also include six near miss encounters. At the time, the new roller coaster was scheduled to open in Spring 2009. [...] Also, in the months after the announcement, Universal surveyed guests on what songs they <b>think</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included in the roller coaster. Some of the artists that guests could choose from were: The Black Eyed Peas, Bee Gees, The Beach Boys, and Johnny Cash.|$|E
500|$|The {{scrutiny}} {{phase of}} the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only {{the name of the}} individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes a Latin oath, which translates to: [...] "I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I <b>think</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> elected." [...] If any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the Infirmarii go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals take the oath and then complete the ballot papers. When the Infirmarii return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.|$|E

6000|$|His {{troops were}} scantily {{supplied}} with regimental clothing. The weather was oppressively warm.

After {{the school}} is thus opened, the teacher will find himself brought to the great {{difficulty}} which embarrasses {{the beginning of his}} labors, i. e. how to find immediate employment at once, for the thirty or forty children who all look up to him waiting for their orders. I say thirty or forty, for the young teacher's first school will usually be a small one. His object, I <b>think,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> in all ordinary cases, for the first few days, twofold. First, to revive and restore, in the main, the general routine of classes and exercises pursued by his predecessor in the same school. And secondly, while doing this, to become as fully acquainted with his scholars as possible.|$|E
60|$|The {{association}} had a {{good bank}} account now, and was very strong. There {{was no longer an}} outsider. A by-law was added forbidding the reception of any more cubs or apprentices for five years; after which time a limited number would be taken, not by individuals, but by the association, upon these terms: the applicant must not be less than eighteen years old, and of respectable family and good character; he must pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars in advance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice, and must remain under the commands of the association until a great part of the membership (more than half, I <b>think)</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> willing to sign his application for a pilot's license.|$|E
60|$|On these grounds I should {{wish to see}} {{established}} in this College a really entire course of English Literature, such as shall give correct, reverent, and loving views of every period, from the earliest legends and poetry of the Middle Age, up to the latest of our modern authors, {{and in the case}} of the higher classes, if it should hereafter be found practicable, lectures devoted to the criticism of such authors as may be exercising any real influence upon the minds of English women. This, I <b>think,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> our ideal. It must be attempted cautiously and step by step. It will not be attained at the first trial, certainly not by the first lecturer. Sufficient, if each succeeding teacher shall leave something more taught, some fresh extension of the range of knowledge which is thought fit for his scholars.|$|E
50|$|The {{support for}} legal {{abortion}} {{in cases when}} it is currently banned is much lower.
