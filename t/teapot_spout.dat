5000|$|The Rangdo, who was {{the ruler}} of planet Arg and {{initially}} referred to as [...] "Uncle" [...] by the other Argonds. In the first series, his human form was played by Ian Messiter, who appeared as an old professor in a velvet jacket, but in later series {{he became one of}} the few Argonds not to appear as a dragon. In series 2 and 3, he became an aspidistra atop an elegant plant stand; he could move around the room and roared and shook when he was angry (the Rangdo was controlled by Kenny Baker). Any human meeting the Rangdo immediately had to placate him by bowing while uttering the phrase [...] "Gronda! Gronda!". In the last series, the Rangdo changed into a <b>teapot</b> instead, <b>spouting</b> steam when displeased.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{sophisticated}} wares in authentic Japanese styles {{were being}} made at Arita for the fastidious home market, European-style designations of Arita porcelain were formed after blue and white kraak porcelains, imitating Chinese underglaze [...] "blue-and-white" [...] wares, or made use of enamel colors over underglazes of cobalt blue and iron red. The ware often used copious gilding, sometimes with spare isolated sprigged vignettes, but often densely patterned in compartments. There were two quite different styles in these wares. Globular Imari <b>teapots</b> with swan-necked <b>spouts</b> helped establish the classic European form for these new necessities of life.|$|R
50|$|The <b>teapot</b> <b>spout</b> design, like a teapot, takes liquid {{from the}} base of the ladle and pours it out via a lip-pour spout. Any {{impurities}} in the molten metal will form on the top of the metal so by taking the metal {{from the base}} of the ladle, the impurities are not poured into the mould. The same idea is behind the bottom pour process.|$|E

Just as {{they are about to}} leave, there is a cave-in, trapping the new Goodies where they experience similar difficulties. Immediately, the 'Future Tim' panics and assumes the pose of a <b>teapot</b> <b>spout</b> and handle, and comments: [...] "I'm a teapot!" ...|$|E
50|$|Keller {{was awarded}} a Lester R. Ford Award (shared with David W. McLaughlin) in 1976 and unshared in 1977. In 1988 {{he was awarded the}} U.S. National Medal of Science, and in 1997 he was awarded the Wolf Prize by the Israel-based Wolf Foundation. In 1996, he was awarded the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics. In 1999 he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for calculating how to make a <b>teapot</b> <b>spout</b> that does not drip. With Patrick B. Warren, Robin C. Ball and Raymond E. Goldstein, Keller {{was awarded a}}n Ig Nobel Prize in 2012 for calculating the forces that shape and move ponytail hair.This makes him the only person to win more than one Ig Nobel Prize. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.|$|E
50|$|The daydreaming Lorenzo Jones (Karl Swenson) was {{employed}} as an auto mechanic at a garage owned by Jim Barker (John Brown, Frank Behrens). Barker's wife Irma (Mary Wickes, Grace Keddy, Nancy Sheridan) {{had her own}} opinions about Lorenzo's inventions. Lorenzo's friend Sandy Matson (Joseph Julian) listened patiently as Lorenzo told him how fame and fortune were just around the corner, even though Lorenzo's dreams and schemes rarely surfaced in the marketplace. However, his wife Belle (Betty Garde, Lucille Wall) always remained faithful as Lorenzo devised such curiosities as an outdoor vacuum cleaner and a <b>teapot</b> with three <b>spouts</b> (for strong, medium and weak tea).|$|R
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to a ladle, a degreasing cup {{can be used to}} skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a <b>teapot,</b> with a <b>spout</b> that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes {{from the bottom of the}} cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes. Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.|$|R

Such kinds of scenes {{are difficult to}} render efficiently via ray tracing but easy for our polygon rasterization based approach. See Section 5 for detailed performance statistics. Furthermore, the image quality generated by our approach is comparable to ray tracing; for each pair of images the ray tracing result {{is on the left}} while our result is on the right. The small images are close-ups around high curvature areas, including <b>teapot</b> <b>spout,</b> lid, and handle, rendered under different view points. Beam tracing [Heckbert and Hanrahan 1984] combines the flexibil-ity of ray tracing and the coherence and speed of polygon rasteri-zation. However, beam tracing so far only handles linear transfor-mations; thus, it is only applicable to linear effects such as planar mirror reflections but not to nonlinear effects such as curved mirror reflection, refraction, caustics, and shadows. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear beam tracing to render these nonlinear global illumination effects. Nonlinear beam trac-ing is highly challenging because commodity graphics hardware supports only linear vertex transformation and triangle rasteriza-tion. We overcome this difficulty by designing a nonlinear graphics pipeline and implementing it on top of a commodity GPU. This al-lows beams to be nonlinear where rays within the same beam {{do not have to be}} parallel or intersect at a single point. A major strength of our algorithm is that it naturally supports fully dynamic scenes as it does not rely on acceleration data structures required for ray trac-ing. Utilizing our approach, nonlinear global illumination effects can be rendered in real-time on a commodity GPU under a unified framework...|$|E
