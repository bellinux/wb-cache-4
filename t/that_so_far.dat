5|$|In the 1950s, the {{development}} of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons {{were found to be}} hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E

25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, Ireland has the {{greatest}} number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe. Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> only she has identified as sheela na gigs. With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December, the Peshmerga {{advanced}} {{even farther}} {{and managed to}} recapture a total of 700 square kilometers of territory and open a corridor from Zummar to Mount Sinjar, thus breaking the 'partial siege' of those mountains. According to {{a statement from the}} Kurdish command, large numbers of ISIL militants were fleeing, westward into Syria, and eastward into Mosul. A total of 53 airstrikes had been carried out as of Thursday evening 18 December. According to the U.S. Pentagon, the airstrikes near Sinjar had targeted ISIL storage units, bulldozers, guard towers, vehicles, and three bridges. Kurdish officials said on 19 December <b>that,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> more than 100 ISIL militants had been killed in this Kurdish Sinjar offensive.|$|E

The project has no sanitation component. In 2008 and 2010 it had approved two grants in the amount of 5.19 billion Yen for water supply in Faisalabad in Punjab. Just as the project in Abbotabad, it aims at developing bulk water supply, in this case from a well field located near a Canal, the Jhang Branch Canal. A parallel project provides training and advice on institutional reforms. The project builds on a previous project to improve the water distribution network in the city.|$|E

25|$|Further {{confusion}} {{arose in}} 1980–1981, {{when there was}} a long debate in the pages of Nature about the scientific status of the theory of evolution. Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the unit of selection in the genome, with one side positing natural selection, and the other, neutral mutation. Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as Phillip E. Johnson took {{this as an opportunity to}} declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.|$|E
25|$|In {{spring of}} 2015, U.S. {{intelligence}} agencies started overhearing conversations in which Russian government officials discussed associates of Donald Trump. British and the Dutch intelligence have given information to United States intelligence about meetings in European cities between Russian officials, associates of Putin, and associates of then-President-elect Trump. American intelligence agencies also intercepted communications of Russian officials, {{some of them}} within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. The New York Times reported that multiple Trump associates, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort {{and other members of}} his campaign, had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials during 2016, although officials said <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far,</b> they did not have evidence that Trump's campaign had co-operated with the Russians to influence the election. , the FBI is investigating Russian involvement in the election, including alleged links between Trump's associates and the Russian government.|$|E
25|$|Silborne {{stated that}} a single glance at the Prussian position, {{as it has been}} described, will suffice to prove that Napoleon was in error as {{regarded}} Blücher's assumed line of battle, and <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from its having been perpendicular to, it was, in the general military acceptation of the term, parallel with, the Namur road. He may however have been misled by the massing of the Prussian troops between the salient point of the position, Saint-Amand, and the road in question, {{as well as by the}} direction of the line of the occupied villages of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact, that Blücher did rely upon the arrival of a portion of Wellington's forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.|$|E

25|$|A select {{committee}} is a committee {{made up of}} a small number of MPs appointed to deal with particular areas or issues. Standing Select Committees (that is, permanently constituted committees) are either chaired by the Speaker of Parliament or an MP appointed to the position, and its members are usually up to seven MPs appointed by Parliament in a manner that ensures <b>that,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as is possible, the balance between the Government benches and the Opposition benches in Parliament is reflected in the Committee. Parliament may also appoint ad hoc Select Committees to deal with other matters, such as to study the details of bills that are before Parliament. In addition, if Parliament resolves that NMPs will be appointed during its term, a Special Select Committee on Nominations for Appointment as NMP is established to consider suggestions for nominees submitted by members of the public.|$|E
25|$|Officials said, {{after initial}} interrogations, {{that it was}} clear the attack was religiously motivated, but <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> there was no {{evidence}} that the brothers had any ties to Islamic terror organizations. Officials also said that Dzhokhar acknowledged his role in the bombings and told interrogators that he and Tamerlan were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs and the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out the bombing. Dzhokhar admitted during questioning that he and his brother were planning to detonate explosives in New York City's Times Square next. The brothers formed the plan spontaneously during the April 18 carjacking, but things went awry after the vehicle ran low on gas and they forced the driver to stop at a gas station, where he escaped. Dzhokhar says he was inspired by online videos from Anwar al-Awlaki, who also inspired Faisal Shahzad, the perpetrator of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt.|$|E
25|$|Word of {{the actions}} in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> had {{repeated}} the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas. Brazilian newspapers such as O Brado de Amazonas and O Sentinella da Monarchia referred to Rosas as a great South American hero. Francisco Antonio Pinto, former president of Chile, declared that the Chilean people was ashamed of the presence in Chile {{of a pair of}} newspapers that supported the Anglo-French cause. The president of Bolivia José Ballivián, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodríguez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the Río de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas. José de San Martín wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also {{wrote a letter to the}} British Morning Chronicle, explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible.|$|E
