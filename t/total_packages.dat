40|$|HP-DSNis {{a set of}} {{distributed}} systems products {{and a set of}} design objectives that provide a framework for interconnecting HP computer systems to form a network. by Andre O. Schwager THE CURRENT computer-industry-wide move towards distributed computer networks and distributed processing is but the latest phase of a net working evolution that began with the first inter connection of two computer systems, with com munication implemented at the user-software level. This was awkward and difficult to use, but it gave users the ability to share peripherals and special system services instead of duplicating them at each system. The concept of easy-to-use distributed networks has been proposed for many years, but implementa tion has been slow, partly because of economic con siderations and a lack of system network software, and partly because users ' traditional ways of doing business are oriented towards centralized control. The availability in recent years of small computers with improved cost/performance has removed the economic impediment. Thus the potential exists for truly distributing processing power, through net working, into every department or functional area of a company, placing the processing power where the work is being done. System power may be increased as needed by adding low-cost systems to the network, thereby building "logically " large systems out of small-system building blocks. The sum of these smaller systems in a network configuration may equal or exceed the power and capability of a large central mainframe. As soon as the hardware components became avail able, the transition from central systems to decen tralized networks began. Because of the complexity and scale of the problem, this move has been cautious, tracking the availability of supportive network man agement software. Initially, most of the software was in the form of "tools " that could be used only by a specially trained, network-knowledgeable program mer at each node in the network. Now, as the issues of decentralized control are being resolved and network software is becoming available, <b>total</b> <b>packages</b> are available to users who see advantages in moving functions away from the central system and out to the network system members...|$|E

2500|$|The tenth {{match was}} between The <b>Total</b> <b>Package</b> and Sting (accompanied by Elizabeth). Prior to the match, Sting was shown handing Elizabeth {{a can of}} what he said was spray, and told her to use it if she had to. [...] The <b>Total</b> <b>Package</b> {{attacked}} Sting as he entered the ring, and continued to have the advantage. Elizabeth climbed onto the apron, and this allowed Sting to fight back. After they knocked down each other with a clothesline, Elizabeth came into the ring, and revealed her alliance with The <b>Total</b> <b>Package</b> by attempting to use the spray on Sting. [...] Unfortunately for her, it was actually a can of silly string, revealing that Sting anticipated being betrayed by his confidante (a common occurrence in Sting's career). Sting performed a Stinger splash to The <b>Total</b> <b>Package,</b> and attempted to apply the Scorpion Deathlock. Elizabeth hit Sting with a baseball bat, and Sting won the match by disqualification. After the match, The <b>Total</b> <b>Package</b> attacked Sting's right arm with a steel chair and the bat.|$|R

40|$|The {{changing}} {{business environment}} in South Africa {{has resulted in}} significant organisational change taking place, as South African companies attempt to remain competitive in an increasingly globalised economy. A key feature in this change process {{is the way in}} which managers are remunerated, with a number of companies implementing a <b>total</b> <b>package</b> approach to managerial compensation. The purpose of this study was to exa 'nine management perceptions of a <b>total</b> <b>package</b> system, in terms of the fairness, equity and efficacy of the system. The research took the form of a case study in one large organisation, using a sample of 162 respondents. A questionnaire was used as the data collection tool, and the outcomes were analysed using the Spearman’s rank correlation co-efficient and interpretations! analysis. The analysis was then discussed in terms of the established theory base. Several factors that predicted perceptions of fairness, equity and efficacy of a <b>total</b> <b>package</b> remuneration system were derived from the analysis. These were consolidated into a process model for use by executives and compensation professionals in designing and implementing <b>total</b> <b>package</b> compensation systems. The model will facilitate the alignment of managerial effort behind organisational objectives, ensuring synergy between the compensation system and the achievement of strategic business objectives...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) is a tactical communications system which provides mobile field radio, telephone, and record traffic for the U. S. Army at corps and division levels. This system went from contract award to materiel fielding {{in a period}} of less than {{two and a half years}} through the utilization of nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition. The accelerated acquisition cycle presented many challenges to the successful deployment of this tactical communications system. This thesis examines the nontraditional methods of materiel fielding which were employed to address the challenges posed by the NDI acquisition of MSE. These nontraditional methods include contractor <b>total</b> <b>package</b> fielding, contractor developed and implemented training, and contractor logistic support. This thesis identifies the implications of these methods as a source of information for those elements of the acquisition community involved in materiel fielding planning. A significant lesson learned is that contractor <b>total</b> <b>package</b> fielding, training, and logistic support are viable alternatives for accomplishing materiel fielding for NDI systems[URL]...|$|R
