Led by Friedman, New York's record soared to 13–1–1. However, their lone loss was a 20–6 setback in November to the Green Bay Packers, and by virtue of this win, and their 12–0–1 record, won the NFL title. Following the season, Mara transferred ownership over to his two sons to insulate <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> creditors. At the time, Jack was just 22, and Wellington only 14.|$|E
