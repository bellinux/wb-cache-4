2500|$|On August 15, 2011, Schultz used an edited {{video clip}} of Texas Governor Rick Perry {{at a rally}} talking about the {{national}} debt crisis. Governor Perry said [...] "getting America back to work {{is the most important}} issue that faces this country, being able to pay off $14.5 trillion or $16 trillion worth of debt. That big black cloud that hangs over America, that debt that is so monstrous." [...] The audio of the clip was cut off after [...] "America", so Schultz's audience did not hear [...] "that debt that is so monstrous". Governor Perry refers to the debt before and after the [...] "big black cloud" [...] statement. Schultz said, [...] "That black cloud Perry is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> President Barack Obama." [...] The following day on his TV show Schultz apologized for taking Governor Perry out of context. [...] "We did not present the full context of those statements and we should have ... No doubt about it, it was a mistake and we regret the error ... we should not have included it in our coverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 2015, {{following}} Donald Trump's call to ban all Muslims from {{traveling to}} the United States, Takei appeared on MSNBC to denounce him: [...] "It's ironic that he made that comment on December 7, Pearl Harbor Day — the very event that put us in those internment camps," [...] Takei said. [...] " [...] {{found that it was}} three things that brought that about. One was racial hysteria, second was war hysteria and third was failure of political leadership. Donald Trump is the perfect example of that failure.... What Donald Trump is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> something that's going to make his logo 'America disgraced again.'" [...] During the transition following Trump's election, Carl Higbie cited the internment of Japanese Americans as a historical precedent for a register of Muslims. [...] Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Trump advisor on immigration matters to Trump, was reportedly proposing the register as the first priority in a suite of proposals for the Department of Homeland Security and as part of the [...] "extreme vetting" [...] of immigrants. [...] Takei quickly described Higbie's comments as [...] "dangerous" [...] and went on to say on The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell that [...] "egistration of any group of people, and certainly registration of Muslims, is a prelude to internment." [...] Takei was not alone in his criticisms, Higbie also attracted criticism in the Washington Post, The New York Times, from Megyn Kelly of Fox News, and from Representative Judy Chu (DCA), who denounced them as [...] "abhorent" [...] idea [...] "based on tactics of fear, division, and hate." [...] The constitutional basis of Higbie's idea was also challenged, even though the Supreme Court has not explicitly overturned Korematsu. Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein has argued that Korematsu has [...] "joined Dred Scott as an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry," [...] while Noah Feldman has declared that [...] "Korematsus uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned." [...] President-elect Trump’s transition team have since issued a statement to The Huffington Post denying that Trump supports a Muslim registry. [...] This claim contradicts statements Trump made in 2015, including those which Takei denounced, and the newspaper noted that video evidence of Trump's statements is available.|$|E

I guess {{it must be a}} branch of the United States, though, for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us Columbia, too, sometimes. It's a lucky thing for you that you butted into me to-night. I'm the only man in New York that can get this gun deal through for you. The Secretary of War of the United States is me best friend. He's in the city now, and I'll see him for you to-morrow. In the meantime, monseer, you keep them drafts tight in your inside pocket. I'll call for you to-morrow, and take you to see him. Say! that ain't the District of Columbia you're <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>is</b> it?" [...] {{concluded}} Mr. Kelley, with a sudden qualm. [...] "You can't capture that with no 2,000 guns--it's been tried with more." ...|$|E
6000|$|She listened all gravely, {{but without}} {{an air of}} offence, and he felt that while he had been timorously calculating the last {{consequences}} of friendship she had quietly enough accepted them. [...] "You surprise me," [...] she said slowly, and her flush still lingered. [...] "But to refuse to answer you would confirm some impression in you even now much too strong. Any 'trouble'--if you mean any unhappiness--that one can sit comfortably <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> an unhappiness with distinct limitations. If I were examined before a board of commissioners for testing the felicity of mankind I'm sure I should be pronounced a very fortunate woman." [...] There was something that deeply touched him in her tone, and this quality pierced further as she continued. [...] "But let me add, with all gratitude for your sympathy, that it's my own affair altogether. It needn't disturb you, my dear sir," [...] she {{wound up with a}} certain quaintness of gaiety, [...] "for I've often found myself in your company contented enough and diverted enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{in order}} to make good sense of the Proposition [...] "some new Cakes are nice", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the form [...] "some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)". Now this {{contains}} two 'TERMS'--"new Cakes" [...] being one of them, and [...] "nice (Cakes)" [...] the other. [...] "New Cakes," [...] being the one we are <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>is</b> called the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and [...] "nice (Cakes)" [...] the 'PREDICATE'. Also this Proposition {{is said to be a}} 'PARTICULAR' one, since it does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of it. The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of [...] "new Cakes". Lastly, if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION' itself, you may take this:--"a sentence stating that some, or none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called its 'Predicate'".|$|E
