5000|$|In {{line with}} the band's horrorcore imagery, the cover depicts a {{photograph}} of a cassette <b>tape</b> <b>clipped</b> to a blood-soaked diary. The inlay follows this theme through, with the lyrics largely in handwriting as if in a diary. The label on the CD itself is black with a splash of red to symbolise a bloodstained handprint. The song material and lyrics are quite dark, covering subjects consistent with the cover and inlay image, such as zombies, murder, conflict, and personal rejection. In spite of all this imagery, the band still felt the need to add a liner note proclaiming, [...] "These songs are fictional and aren't a veiled threat to anyone living or dead. Seriously".|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a music type recognition {{system that can}} be used to index and search in multimedia databases. A new approach to temporal structure modeling is supposed. The so called ETM-NN (Explicit Time Modelling with Neural Network) method uses abstraction of acoustical events to the hidden units of a neural network. This new set of abstract features representing temporal structures, can be then learned via a traditional neural networks to discriminate between different types of music. The experiments show that this method outperforms HMMs significantly. 1. INTRODUCTION As the demand for multimedia databases grows, the development of information retrieval systems including information about music is of increasing concern. Radio stations and music TV channels hold archives of millions of music <b>tapes</b> and video <b>clips.</b> For an easy and fast search in databases automatically indexing of <b>tapes</b> and <b>clips</b> is required.

50|$|It {{was later}} {{explained}} by her manager, Mani Fok, {{that the reason}} for Yumiko's tube dress sliding down was due to the dress not being able to withhold the weight of the headphones receiver that Yumiko was wearing for her performance. Hence, the tube top started to slide down as Yumiko was dancing. When asked why Yumiko did not do more to secure her tubetop, Fok explained that the tube top was already secured by double-sided tape and that the receiver was also secured with duct <b>tape</b> upon <b>clipping</b> onto the tubetop. Further protection procedures would make the tube dress too tight for Yumiko to wear.|$|R
5000|$|Artificial hair integrations, more {{commonly}} known as hair extensions or hair weaves, add length and/or fullness to human hair. Hair extensions are usually clipped on by other hair by incorporating additional human or synthetic hair. Natural human hair can be permed, dyed, and flat ironed whereas synthetic hair cannot. The methods include <b>tape</b> in extensions, <b>clip</b> in or clip on extensions, fusion method, weaving method, and wigs.|$|R

Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R

50|$|A {{detachable}} box {{magazine is}} a self-contained mechanism {{capable of being}} loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver, usually below the action but occasionally to the side (Sten, FG 42, Johnson LMG) or on top (Madsen machine gun, Bren gun, FN P90). When necessary, the magazine can easily be detached from the firearm and replaced by another. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case. Detachable box magazines may be metal or plastic. The plastic magazines are sometimes partially transparent so the operator can easily check the remaining ammunition. Box magazines are often affixed to each other with clamps, <b>clips,</b> <b>tape,</b> straps, or built-in studs to facilitate faster reloading: see jungle style.|$|R
500|$|The script of Ron Howard's 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, {{loosely based}} on Sylvia Nasar's 1998 {{biography}} of the mathematician John Nash, sparked her interest in the project. Connelly was invited to an audition after her agent Risa Shapiro sent the producers a <b>tape</b> with a <b>clip</b> of the yet unreleased Requiem for a Dream. She was cast by the film's producer, Brian Grazer, as Alicia Nash, the caring and enduring wife of the brilliant, schizophrenic mathematician, played by Russell Crowe. Howard and the producers eventually chose them after being particularly impressed by their screen chemistry. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing more than US$313million worldwide. Connelly {{had the chance to}} meet the real Alicia Nash before starting shooting and learned more about her life. For her portrayal, Connelly earned a Golden Globe, an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Time magazine critic Richard Schickel called her performance [...] "luminous" [...] and the actress intelligent and passionate. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "...Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia. Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe, it is Connelly's complex work, depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man, that elevates the film to a higher level".|$|R
