5|$|Installation of Transformers: The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, {{required}} {{the removal of}} two attractions. On Sunday, April 11, 2010, Backdraft and Special Effects Stages closed. <b>The</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Effects</b> Stages were relocated to the Upper Lot and renamed <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Effects</b> Stage on June 26, 2010. Work began almost immediately {{on the construction of}} the ride. After a period of construction spanning close to two years, the ride and its gift store, the Transformers Supply Vault, soft opened to the public in late April 2012. Transformers: The Ride officially opened to the public on May 24, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Enter the Void won the Special Jury Award and {{the prize}} for Best Cinematography at the 2009 Sitges Film Festival. It {{received}} the main award for best film at the 2010 Neuchâtel Film Festival. This especially delighted Noé, since one of the jury members in Neuchâtel was Douglas Trumbull, <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> supervisor of 2001: A Space Odyssey.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> was {{achieved}} by using a hypodermic needle, spreading black ink {{across the bottom of}} a glass tank filled with tinted water.|$|R
5|$|Harry Woolman {{worked on}} <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> along with Baker, and Willy Curtis worked as the film's cinematographer. Some scenes {{included}} photography errors, {{including one in}} which light shines through a kitchen window from outside {{even though it is}} supposed to be nighttime. Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober.|$|E
5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> for the film. Obayashi desired <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticisms of}} the film were that its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was crowded, and it was overlong. However, <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects,</b> chemistry between Stone and Garfield, Dane DeHaan's performance, the action scenes, and Hans Zimmer's musical score were met with high praise. Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} shot on-location in Romania, {{utilizing}} stop-motion and rod puppet techniques {{to achieve the}} look the director wanted for the series' subspecies creatures. The series has had mixed reviews with critics citing vampire clichés as a downfall of the films, but generally commending the director's choice in filming in Romania, as well as <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Filmed between May and June 1980, Inseminoid {{is based}} on a script written by Nick and Gloria Maley, a couple who had contributed to <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> of Warren's films {{starting}} with Satan's Slave (1976). A low budget of £1million, half of which was contributed by the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers, funded location filming in both the Chislehurst Caves in Kent and on the island of Gozo in Malta. Composer John Scott perfected the electronic score of Inseminoid in multiple hours-long studio sessions following the completion of shooting.|$|E
5|$|Forward Unto Dawn {{received}} a Streamy Award {{and several of}} the crew {{received a}}wards for their work editing, producing and filming of it. The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing. Reviewers were impressed by <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> and action-packed second act, but found that the plot was too slow {{in the first half and}} most of the characters were under-developed. The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of writing this episode, Mathews was [...] "obsessed" [...] with <b>the</b> poor <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> of Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film The Birds. The non sequitur scene where the priests are {{attacked}} by birds was originally an attempt to recreate the film's backwards tracking shot, with people running and waving their hands, which Mathews found unintentionally hilarious. Linehan notes that the joke did not translate well in the final episode, because <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> for <b>the</b> birds was actually quite good.|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> film's virtuosic <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> were {{supervised}} by Clifford Stine, head of <b>the</b> studio's <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> department.

5|$|In {{the first}} {{underwater}} scene, {{most of which}} was shot at the water tank at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car {{that was supposed to}} be submerged thirteen feet. In actuality, the water tank was four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, {{in which the}} camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue.|$|E

Due to <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> sun's rays {{falling on the}} water droplets around the waterfall, it looks orange-yellow in colour and so the name is [...] "Arishina" [...] (Turmeric/Yellow).|$|R
5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} of <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, {{in addition to}} rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had {{a mediocre}} {{reception}} at the box office, which ruled out the production of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> have been praised, commentators are divided {{on the quality of}} the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Roger Deakins {{signed on}} as cinematographer, having {{previously}} worked with Mendes on Jarhead and Revolutionary Road. Dennis Gassner returned as production designer, the costume designer was Jany Temime, Alexander Witt {{was director of the}} second unit, the stunt co-ordinator was Gary Powell and Chris Corbould supervised <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>effects,</b> while the visual effects supervisor was Steve Begg. All have worked on previous Bond films. Daniel Kleinman returned to design the film's title sequence after stepping aside to allow graphic design studio MK12 to create the Quantum of Solace sequence.|$|E
