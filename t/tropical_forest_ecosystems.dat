40|$|The {{increasing}} scientific {{consensus on}} global warming, {{together with the}} precautionary principle {{and the fear of}} non-linear climate transitions is leading to increasing action to mitigate global warming. To help mitigate global warming, carbon storage by forests is often mentioned as the only or the best way to reduce the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. This book presents evidence that tropical grasslands, which cover 50 % of the earth’s surface, are as important as forests for the sequestration of carbon. Results are reported of a large five year on-farm research project carried out in Latin America (Colombia, Costa Rica). Soil and vegetation carbon stocks of long-established pasture, fodder bank and silvopastoral systems on commercial farms were compared with those of adjacent forest and degraded land. The objective was to identify production systems that both increase livestock productivity and farm income and, at the same time, contribute to a reduction of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. The project was carried out in four ecosystems: the Andean hillsides of the semi-evergreen forest in Colombia; the Colombian humid Amazonian <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> ecosystem; the sub-humid <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica; and the humid <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica...|$|R

50|$|Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is an entomopathogen, or insect-pathogenising fungus, {{discovered}} by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, and currently found predominantly in <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> O. unilateralis, {{also referred to as}} a zombie fungus, infects ants of the Camponotini tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to affix themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains until its eventual death. The process leading to mortality takes 4-10 days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. O. unilateralis is in turn also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence which can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.|$|E
5000|$|Biodiversity, a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "biological diversity," [...] generally {{refers to}} the [...] and variability of life on Earth. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, biodiversity typically measures variation at the genetic, the species, and the ecosystem level. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, {{which seems to be}} the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth, and is richest in the tropics. These <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> cover less than 10 per cent of earth's surface, and contain about 90 percent of the world's species. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} water uptake by lateral roots of savanna {{trees in the}} Brazilian {{highlands}} was measured by irrigating two 2 by 2 m plots with deuterium-enriched water and assaying for the abundance of deuterium in stem water from trees inside and at several distances from the irrigation plots. Stem water of trees inside the irrigation plots was highly enriched {{compared to that of}} control trees, whereas stem water of trees just outside the plot was only slightly enriched compared with that from control trees. Therefore, bulk water uptake in the savanna trees studied occurred in a horizontally restricted area, indicating that their rooting structure was characterized by a dense cluster of short roots associated with the main trunk and a few meandering long range lateral roots. This root architecture was confirmed by extensive excavations of several species. The same deuterium labeling pattern was observed in an Amazonian <b>tropical</b> <b>forest.</b> The savanna <b>ecosystem,</b> however, differed from the <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystem</b> by having a greater proportion of trees outside the irrigation plots having stem water with deuterium levels significantly above background.

40|$|Over 400 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests are managed for timber production, comprising {{more than half}} of the remaining global permanent tropical forest estate. A growing proportion of tropical production forests are managed under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles. The objective of SFM is to achieve multiple benefits, including forest protection, biodiversity conservation and income enhancement. However, the outcomes resulting from the implementation of SFM in <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> have seldom been examined rigorously. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assess broad-scale impacts of SFM policy in <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> As a case study, we investigated deforestation and timber production in logging concessions in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of its SFM-based forestry law in 2000. Compliance with the forestry law was incomplete, allowing a unique opportunity to compare deforestation and legal timber production outcomes in concessions that implemented SFM-based policy compared to those that did not. Quasi-experimental matching analysis indicated that deforestation in matched parcels in compliant concessions was up to 2 -times higher than matched parcels in non-compliant concessions, equivalent to 67 km 2 of forest loss for the period 2005 – 2010. Annual deforestation data demonstrated that deforestation was stable or increased in all six concessions following the respective date of compliance in each concession. Legal timber production increased (by 5 %, from 0. 18 to 0. 19 CBM/ha/yr) and became more stable, in compliant compared to non-compliant concessions. Our results suggest that the presence of SFM in a concession does not immediately lead to less deforestation. Rather, SFM policy may be associated with higher deforestation, because SFM is also associated with higher legal timber production, foreign capital, and international timber demand. Our findings measure short-term associations between SFM and deforestation in the Congo, and underscore the need for empirical evaluation of long-term impacts of SFM in <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ecosystems</b> worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Global {{changes such as}} {{increasing}} CO 2, rising temperature, and land-use change are likely to drive shifts in litter inputs to forest floors, but the effects of such changes on litter decomposition remain largely unknown. We initiated a litter manipulation experiment to test the response of litter decomposition to litter removal/addition in three successional forests in southern China, namely masson pine forest (MPF), mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MEBF). Results showed that litter removal decreased litter decomposition rates by 27 %, 10 % and 8 % and litter addition increased litter decomposition rates by 55 %, 36 % and 14 % in MEBF, MF and MPF, respectively. The magnitudes of changes in litter decomposition were more significant in MEBF forest and less significant in MF, but not significant in MPF.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this work is to assess the {{potential}} of multitemporal images from the 1 -km SPOT- 4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor to obtain a land cover map of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) for the year 2000, discriminating primary <b>tropical</b> <b>forest,</b> cerrado savanna, agriculture/pasture, natural/artificial waterbodies, and secondary succession forest, using a probability-bagging classification tree (PBCT). The 10 -fold cross validation procedure yielded an overall sample accuracy of 0. 92. Besides, this algorithm allowed us to build a class membership probability map, with ~ 80 % of the pixels with class membership probability greater or equal than 0. 8. The estimated total area of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the BLA was 877, 435 km 2 and 57, 636 km 2, respectively. Comparison with an existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred primarily in areas previously occupied by primary <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> (45. 8 %) and cerrado savanna (32. 7 %).
