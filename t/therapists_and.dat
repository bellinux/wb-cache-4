5|$|The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ {{is one of}} {{the better}} known of these checklists and is used by {{attachment}} <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> others. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties. Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity.|$|E
5|$|The {{attachment}} theory {{focused on}} {{the attention of the}} child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.|$|E

This ongoing pilot study examines {{the role of}} Internet-based, World Wide Web electronic communication, including textual, audio, and video, over a HIPAA-compliant network configuration, to enhance patient care in an outpatient physical therapy rehabilitation setting. Areas that can benefit from telemedicine are targeted, and include communication between physical <b>therapist</b> <b>and</b> specialty <b>therapist,</b> between physical <b>therapist</b> <b>and</b> treating physician, between physical <b>therapist</b> <b>and</b> case manager and insurance adjustor, <b>and</b> between physical <b>therapist</b> <b>and</b> their patients.

5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E

25|$|The dropout level—early termination—ranges {{from around}} 30% to 60%, {{depending}} partly {{on how it}} is defined. The range is lower for research settings for various reasons, such as the selection of clients {{and how they are}} inducted. Early termination is associated on average with various demographic and clinical characteristics of clients, <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> treatment interactions. The high level of dropout has raised some criticism about the relevance and efficacy of psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Art <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> other {{professionals}} use art-based assessments to evaluate emotional, cognitive, and developmental conditions. There are also many psychological assessments that utilize artmaking to analyze {{various types of}} mental functioning (Betts, 2005). Art <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> {{other professionals}} are educated to administer and interpret these assessments, most of which rely on simple directives and a standardized array of art materials (Malchiodi 1998, 2003; Betts, 2005). The first drawing assessment for psychological purposes was created in 1906 by German psychiatrist Fritz Mohr (Malchiodi 1998). In 1926, researcher Florence Goodenough created a drawing test to measure the intelligence in children called the Draw–A–Man Test (Malchiodi 1998). The key to interpreting the Draw-A-Man Test was that the more details a child incorporated into the drawing, the MORE intelligent they were (Malchiodi, 1998). Goodenough and other researchers realized the test had just {{as much to do}} with personality as it did intelligence (Malchiodi, 1998). Several other psychiatric art assessments were created in the 1940s, and have been used ever since (Malchiodi 1998).|$|E
