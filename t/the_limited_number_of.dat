5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. <b>The</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E

It was later extended to other public transit systems throughout the region. SmarTrip users receive discounts on Metrorail fares. Although WMATA initially drew criticism due to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> SmarTrip sales locations, distribution {{has expanded to}} local convenience stores and supermarkets. By late 2012 all Metrorail stations were equipped with SmarTrip vending machines.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July. <b>The</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> anti-tank guns present were exposed and quickly immobilised or forced to withdraw. This left the infantry to be surrounded and large numbers were forced to surrender. Some soldiers {{made it to the}} positions of 19th Battalion, but it too became surrounded. By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E

50|$|The F.30 {{appears to}} have been {{produced}} principally by the Dux Factory in Moscow, although some level of construction seems to have also taken place at several of the other major Russian aircraft factories. With over 400 planes built at Dux alone, it far outnumbered the Lebed and Anatra designs or <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> fighters assembled from imported components, although the situation is less clear with the Voisin V.

5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E

5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> workplaces within walking distance.|$|E

5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. <b>The</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{while the}} {{armoured}} units {{that were involved}} in operations overseas acquitted themselves well, despite significant investment {{in the development of}} tank forces, they ultimately played a limited role in the Australian war effort. Three armoured divisions capable of independent operations were formed during World War II, but none were deployed outside Australia. Many individual units later fought against the Japanese in the Pacific, although only in regimental strength. Despite initial delays in receiving adequate equipment a considerable force had subsequently been developed, although it was not until late 1942 that the first units saw action in support of the infantry in New Guinea. Yet the need to quickly deploy units following the rapid Japanese advance {{and the nature of the}} terrain in the South West Pacific Area in which the bulk of Australian forces would fight meant they were unable to be deployed as a formation. Meanwhile, as the threat of invasion passed the need for large armoured formations had lessened, and the divisions had been broken up between mid-1943 and 1944 with only one operational brigade remaining by the end of the war. However, despite using tanks that were obsolete by the standards of the war in Europe the contribution of the Australian Armoured Corps to the success of later campaigns was significant, lessening casualties among the infantry and demonstrating the role of tanks in jungle operations. The Matilda proved the most successful tank used in jungle fighting by the Australian Army, achieving immediate success following its deployment to New Guinea in 1943 due to its heavy armour, manoeuvrability in close terrain, and the effectiveness of its 2-pounder against Japanese bunkers. This was possible due to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective antitank weapons deployed by the Japanese in the areas where the Matilda was used, while the terrain was conducive to it being operated alongside infantry—in the role for which the Matilda had originally been designed.|$|E

30|$|Considering {{these many}} factors, Prismatic uses the {{following}} heuristic {{to choose a}} good launch configuration. At runtime, {{the properties of the}} available devices are queried, which includes the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threads per threadblock, the total amount of shared memory, and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> streaming multiprocessors. BlockSize_x is chosen to be either the largest power of two smaller than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plane waves or the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threads per block, whichever is smaller. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threadblocks that can run concurrently on a single streaming multiprocessor is then estimated using BlockSize_x, <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threads per block, and <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threadblocks per streaming multiprocessor. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> threadblocks across the entire device is then estimated as this number times the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> streaming multiprocessors, and then the grid dimensions of the launch configuration are set to create three times this many blocks, where the factor of three is a fudge factor that we found produces better results.|$|R
