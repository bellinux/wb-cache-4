However, when located in methoxypropionitrile MPN, which is frequently used as electrolyte solvent in dye sensitized solar cells, the back electron transfer is significantly retarded. Results are obtained both for picosecond and microsecond time scales using transient absorption spectroscopy. As solvent induced interfacial energy level shifts can be excluded as possible cause, the role of TiO 2 surface states in the beneficial retardation process is investigated. Highly surface sensitive synchrotron induced photoelectron spectroscopy exhibits high densities of surface states on the pristine nanocrystalline TiO 2 nc TiO 2 surfaces. While SY 1 T dye sensitization from a SY 1 T solution in tetrahydrofuran saturates about 30 of the surface states, the subsequent in situ adsorption of MPN molecules at the TiO 2 SY 1 <b>T</b> <b>interface</b> leads to further reduction by more than 50 of the remaining surface states.

40|$|Visual GUI Testing (VGT) is a tool-driven {{technique}} for automated GUI-based testing that uses image recognition {{to interact with}} and assert the correctness {{of the behavior of}} a system through its GUI as it is shown to the user. The technique's applicability, e. g. defect-finding ability, and feasibility, e. g. time to positive return on investment, have been shown through empirical studies in industrial practice. However, {{there is a lack of}} studies that evaluate the usefulness and challenges associated with VGT when used long-term (years) in industrial practice. This paper evaluates how VGT was adopted, applied and why it was abandoned at the music streaming application development company, Spotify, after several years of use. A qualitative study with two workshops and five well chosen employees is performed at the company, supported by a survey, which is analyzed with a grounded theory approach to answer the study's three research questions. The interviews provide insights into the challenges, problems and limitations, but also benefits, that Spotify experienced during the adoption and use of VGT. However, due to the technique's drawbacks, VGT has been abandoned for a new technique/framework, simply called the <b>Test</b> <b>interface.</b> The <b>Test</b> <b>interface</b> is considered more robust and flexible for Spotify's needs but has several drawbacks, including that it does not test the actual GUI as shown to the user like VGT does. From the study's results it is concluded that VGT can be used long-term in industrial practice but it requires organizational change as well as engineering best practices to be beneficial. Through synthesis of the study's results, and results from previous work, a set of guidelines are presented that aim to aid practitioners to adopt and use VGT in industrial practice. However, due to the abandonment of the technique, future research is required to analyze in what types of projects the technique is, and is not, long-term viable. To this end, we also present Spotify's <b>Test</b> <b>interface</b> solution for automated GUI-based testing and conclude that it has its own benefits and drawbacks...|$|R

40|$|We {{have found}} that {{molybdenum}} dioxide (MoO_ 2) is an excellent dopant for enhancing electrical conductivities in organic hole-transporting layers. We fabricated hole-only devices with an alpha-sexithiophene (α- 6 T) layer doped with MoO_ 2 at various concentrations to investigate how doping MoO_ 2 into the α- 6 T layers influences the hole-injection and hole-transport characteristics of these layers. We observed a marked increase in electrical conductivity {{as a result of}} the MoO_ 2 doping. The 30 -mol % MoO_ 2 -doped α- 6 T layer had a high electrical conductivity of 8. 9 ± 1. 3 × 10 ^ S/cm. From the results of our visible/near-infrared absorption spectra study of these doped layers, we confirmed that this increase in electrical conductivity is caused by a charge transfer between MoO_ 2 and α- 6 T, which leads to an increase in free hole concentration in the doped layers and the formation of an ohmic contact at an electrode/α- 6 <b>T</b> <b>interface.</b> In the latter part of this paper, we discuss current flow and electroluminescence (EL) characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a 30 -mol % MoO_ 2 -doped α- 6 T hole-transporting layer and a 30 -mol % Cs-doped phenyldipyrenylphosphine oxide (POPy_ 2) electron-transporting layer. We achieved an extremely low driving voltage of 3. 1 V required for a current density of 100 mA/cm^ 2 in the doped OLEDs owing to the use of the α- 6 T and POPy_ 2 layers with high carrier mobilities and the excellent p-type MoO_ 2 and n-type Cs dopants. We demonstrated the enhancement of power efficiencies by ≈ 2 times in the doped OLEDs compared with undoped OLEDs and observed bright EL at low driving voltages in the doped OLEDs, for example, 100 cd/m^ 2 at 2. 3 V, 1000 cd/m^ 2 at 2. 7 V, and 10 000 cd/m^ 2 at 3. 3 V...|$|E

40|$|Optimal T cell {{activation}} typically requires {{engagement of}} both the TCR and costimulatory receptors, such as CD 28. Engagement of CD 28 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic region and recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Although the exact mechanism of CD 28 signal transduction is unknown, CD 28 triggering has similarities to the TCR, which was proposed to use the kinetic-segregation (KS) mechanism. The KS model postulates that, when small receptors engage their ligands within areas of close (∼ 15 nm) contact in the <b>T</b> cell/APC <b>interface,</b> this facilitates phosphorylation by segregating the engaged receptor/ligand complex from receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases with large ectodomains, such as CD 45. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of elongating the extracellular region of the CD 28 ligand, CD 80, {{on its ability to}} costimulate IL- 2 production by primary T cells. CD 80 elongation reduced its costimulatory effect without abrogating CD 28 binding. Confocal microscopy revealed that elongated CD 80 molecules were less well segregated from CD 45 at the <b>T</b> cell/APC <b>interface.</b> <b>T</b> cells expressing CD 28 harboring a key tyrosine- 170 mutation were less sensitive to CD 80 elongation. In summary, the effectiveness of CD 28 costimulation is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the CD 28 -CD 80 complex. Small CD 28 -CD 80 complex dimensions are required for optimal costimulation by segregation from large inhibitory tyrosine phosphatases. These results demonstrate the importance of ligand dimensions for optimal costimulation of IL- 2 production by T cells and suggest that the KS mechanism contributes to CD 28 signaling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{induction}} of {{a proper}} {{adaptive immune response}} {{is dependent on the}} correct transfer of information between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and antigen-specific T cells. Defects in information transfer may result in the development of diseases, e. g. immunodeficiencies and autoimmunity. A distinct 3 -dimensional supramole-cular structure at the <b>T</b> cell/APC <b>interface</b> has been suggested {{to be involved in the}} information transfer. Due to its functional analogy to the neuronal synapse, the structure has been termed the “immunological synapse ” (IS). Here, we review molecular aspects concerning IS formation, appearance, and cessation. In addition, proposed functions of the IS are discussed. The process of IS formation occurs in a sequential manner, initially causing a remarkable large-scale redistribution of a number of integral membrane and cytosolic proteins. At the <b>T</b> cell/APC <b>interface</b> the structure comprises in its nascent stage a non-random pattern of protein distribution. The protein pattern is regulated during development of the mature IS and is finally organized into concentric rings of co-receptors and adhesive molecules surrounding the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The relocations of proteins are influenced by passive as well as active mechanisms. Considering the IS as a device enabling cell-cell com-munication, clarification of its exact function is of huge general as well as therapeutic interest.

In particular, the <b>T</b> 1 <b>interface</b> is popular {{because it is a}} cost-effective way to deliver a large number of voice channels.

There exist two reasonable alternatives for digital interfaces in modern day telephony: T 1 and ISDN.
