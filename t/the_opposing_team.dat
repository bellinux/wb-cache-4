5|$|Buried: A team {{of players}} is tasked to destroy <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> Vital Points, which reveal their High Value Target upon destruction. Players are tasked to {{eliminate}} <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> target {{in order to}} win the match.|$|R
5000|$|The third speaker's role is {{to refute}} <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> case, and to {{conclude}} and summarise {{his or her own}} team's case. The third speaker cannot make 'new' arguments in favour of his or her position. The goal of the third speaker should not be simply to pick out technical and practical flaws in <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> case, but to undermine the deepest, most basic philosophical premises of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> argument.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} is to either capture all of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team’s</b> pieces except for the Commander or both of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team’s</b> Commanders. A team may also capture the Commander from one player {{and all of his}} partner’s pieces except for the Commander.|$|R
5|$|Each period, {{and after}} each goal scored, play is {{restarted}} with a face-off. If a ball travels {{over the boards}} {{and outside of the}} playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> to that which last touched the ball.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play that members of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. <b>The</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
50|$|Respond to {{arguments}} {{raised by}} <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Every {{marching band}} that plays for a Big Ten Conference {{football}} <b>team</b> salutes <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> fans during pregame with their fight song. [...] The Penn State Blue Band inserts <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> fight song {{into the middle}} of the pregame performance, and forms the first letter of the name of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> school while playing their song towards their fans. [...] This happens immediately after the [...] "Star Spangled Banner" [...] (at a home game) or [...] "Lion Fanfare and Downfield" [...] (at an away game). [...] In both cases, this is directly before [...] "NFOS" [...] and the PSU formation.|$|R

5|$|Chance was a disciplinarian. He preached {{moderation}} in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to {{his players}}. Chance fined his players for {{shaking hands with}} members of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker {{for the remainder of}} the season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-series period, two {{observers}} of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> {{were allowed to}} scout the teams. Toronto Maple Leafs' coach John McLellan and Bob Davidson, the Leafs' head scout went to the Soviet Union to observe the Soviets in the Sovietsky Sport tournament. McLellan and Davidson observed two games, while Kulagin, along with Arkadi Chernyshev, a former assistant to Tarasov, observed all of the Canadians' practices in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the wooden spoon for finishing on the bottom of the competition ladder.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship {{due to an}} unforced error by <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{touchdown}} (TD), worth six points, is {{the most}} valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered {{in the end zone}} of <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team.</b> The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.|$|E
5|$|While on Team Str8 Rippin in 2005, Leto {{stated that}} their style was unique, since any team member might take on {{any role in}} their attack formation. They were also patient, content to wait their enemies out and force <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> to attack when Str8 Rippin is ahead. Zyos insisted upon his {{teammates}} being silent and not trash-talking during matches {{in order to maintain}} focus.|$|E
50|$|Competitors {{must move}} a barrel across <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> line using water {{pressure}} from a fire hose.|$|R
50|$|Volley: After the serve, teams {{alternate}} {{striking the}} ball onto <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> side of <b>the</b> table.|$|R
50|$|When you’re {{in battle}} {{position}} you may choose, from one throw to the next, from which baseline {{you wish to}} throw. For tactical reasons you may choose to throw from baseline 1 to try to knock out <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team’s</b> balls from <b>the</b> triangles. For example, when <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team’s</b> only remaining block left standing is the Lady, and while your team has not succeeded in knocking down any blocks.|$|R
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} Street Fighter, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team.</b> The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E
5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

5000|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} for players to make their way into <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> territory, grab <b>the</b> flag and return with it to their own territory without being tagged. The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it. Within their own territory players are [...] "safe", meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players. Once they cross into <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> territory they are vulnerable.|$|R
5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team.</b> These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, irrespective of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team</b> by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
25|$|Number One is {{the most}} offence-oriented {{position}} on the field. The Number One position generally covers <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> <b>team's</b> Number Four.|$|R
