The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E
25|$|In Unscramble this Picture Puzzle, a 3 by 3 or a 4 by 4 sliding puzzle {{is shown}} on the screens, later it became a 5 by 5 sliding puzzle. The puzzle can be a person, a place or an object. When a team buzzes in, the puzzle freezes. The first team to {{identify}} the puzzle gets 10 points for their team and the puzzle is instantly revealed to the audience. If they get it wrong, no points are deducted but they get locked out allowing the other teams <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> If all three teams fail to identify the puzzle (scrambled or not), no points are given out {{and the answer is}} revealed.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability {{to answer a question}} before trying <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it.</b> This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual is more likely to judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E

25|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood (also {{known as}} Ode, Immortality Ode or Great Ode) is {{a poem by}} William Wordsworth, {{completed}} in 1804 and published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). The poem was completed in two parts, with the first four stanzas written among a series of poems composed in 1802 about childhood. The {{first part of the}} poem was completed on 27 March 1802 and a copy was provided to Wordsworth's friend and fellow poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who responded with his own poem, , in April. The fourth stanza of the ode ends with a question, and Wordsworth was finally able <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> with 7 additional stanzas completed in early 1804. It was first printed as Ode in 1807, and it was not until 1815 that it was edited and reworked to the version that is currently known, Ode: Intimations of Immortality.|$|E

Nixon followed up on the Pink Sheet with a radio address on September 18, accusing Douglas of being [...] "a member of a small clique which joins the notorious communist party-liner Vito Marcantonio of New York, in voting time after time against measures that are for the security of this country". He assailed Douglas for advocating that Taiwan's seat on the United Nations Security Council be given to the People's Republic of China, as appeasement towards communism.|$|E

500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> honestly with a wink and a smile. As cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E

2500|$|More particularly, two {{incidents}} involving Trudeau are {{remembered as}} having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During {{a visit to}} Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met {{with a group of}} farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with [...] "Why should I sell your wheat?"– however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he [...] "gave the finger" [...] to a group of protesters through the carriage window– less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and they all go down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” He was hardly alone. “‘What shall we do with the Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it,</b> or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{while at}} home, Peyton yells at Brooke {{that she did}} not ruin their friendship; Brooke ruined it a long time ago. Following this, Peyton decides to skip prom, but gets {{convinced}} not to do so by Lucas. As she walks to her door <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> (thinking it is Lucas), the man behind the door turns around and it is actually her stalker, Psycho Derek. He ties her up and gags her in her basement and proceeds to make a mock prom for them; he takes pictures of the bound and gagged Peyton, dancing with her and telling her they are gonna [...] "go upstairs and have the perfect prom night". Brooke arrives, knowing that Peyton would never skip prom. Psycho Derek tries to kill Brooke, but Peyton and Brooke eventually defeat him and he ends up in jail. This experience repairs Peyton and Brooke's friendship. Peyton learns that Psycho Derek's real name is Ian Banks. She forgives him after discovering disturbing facts about his past, and tells him that she hopes he finds peace. Lucas and Peyton eventually have sex together for the first time. After making sure with Lucas, Peyton decides to take an internship in L.A. and thus spends the whole summer with Brooke.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the play}} the two theatre critics discuss things they may write about this typical whodunit, {{but they are}} often sidetracked by their soliloquies, Moon's {{concerning}} his professional jealousy of Higgs and Birdboot's concerning his newly found [...] "love", the actress playing Cynthia. As they talk, the telephone on stage begins to ring incessantly until Moon cannot stand it any more. He walks up on stage <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> {{only to discover that}} Birdboot's wife, Myrtle, is on the line. Birdboot speaks to her and as he hangs up, the play suddenly starts again and he gets trapped in it, mistaken for Simon, leading to his inevitable demise as he executes the role to its end, just after recognising the dead body onstage as Higgs, the first string critic who was unavailable that night. Moon ascends the stage to unravel Birdboot's death, taking on the role of Inspector Hound. Major Magnus accuses Moon of being the madman, since he is not the real Inspector Hound, and he tries to run but Magnus shoots him. As Moon lies dying on the floor, Magnus reveals himself to not only be the real Inspector Hound but also Cynthia's lost husband, Albert, who had disappeared ten years earlier. Moon, however, also recognises him as third-string critic Puckeridge, who will now become the first-string as both Higgs and Moon are out of the way.|$|E
2500|$|From Jeffrey's writing style, Hazlitt {{transitions}} to the conversational {{abilities of the}} man in company (and it is only in [...] "mixed company" [...] that [...] "Mr. Jeffrey shines"). Again, the portrait is mostly positive but with a few faults noted in passing. [...] "Mr. Jeffrey's conversation is equally lively, various and instructive. ... Whether it be politics, or poetry, or science, or anecdote, or wit, or raillery, he takes up his cue without effort" [...] and provides [...] "an uninterrupted flow of cheerfulness and animal spirits" [...] and enormous [...] "fund of information". Yet, again, his fault is that it is all too much: [...] "If he is ever tedious, it is from an excess of liveliness". In addition, he shows too much of the lawyer: [...] "what is said by another, seems to make no impression on him; he is bound to dispute, <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it,</b> as if he was in Court". Jeffrey also shows a bit too much of what Hazlitt finds typical of the character of Scottish intellectuals; in Scotland, [...] "they criticise every thing, analyse every thing, argue upon every thing, dogmatise upon every thing". This makes Jeffrey [...] "too didactic, too pugnacious, too full of electric shocks, too much like a voltaic battery", and he [...] "reposes too little on his own excellent good sense, his own love of ease, his cordial frankness of temper and unaffected candour." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up.

[...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>it</b> 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together.

2500|$|Roosevelt {{attended}} the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago {{and gave a}} speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch, an Edmunds supporter, to be temporary chair. Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers; however, Blaine, having gained support from Arthur's and Edmunds' delegates, won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine. He bragged about his one small success: [...] "We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman... To do this needed a mixture of skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions to come in... to defeat the common foe." [...] He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date. Having gotten a taste of national politics, Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; he then retired to his new [...] "Chimney Butte Ranch" [...] on the Little Missouri River. Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York and the Democratic nominee in the general election. He debated {{the pros and cons}} of staying loyal with his political friend, Henry Cabot Lodge. After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give [...] "hearty support to any decent Democrat". He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant [...] "for publication". When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, [...] "That question I decline <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> <b>It</b> is a subject I do not care to talk about." [...] In the end, he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP, and he did so in a press release on July 19. Having lost the support of many reformers, Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota.|$|E
