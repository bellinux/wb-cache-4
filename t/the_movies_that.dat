She knew (from <b>the</b> <b>movies)</b> <b>that</b> blacks were deathly afraid of ghosts. With the help of two confederates, Frank Carson and Al Weinshank, she offered Peavey ten dollars if he would identify Taylor's grave in the Hollywood Park Cemetery (which she had already visited).|$|E

Smith, {{impressed}} {{by the fact that}} Linklater set and shot the film in his hometown of Austin, Texas rather than on a sound stage in a major city, was inspired to become a filmmaker, and to set films where he lived. Smith relates: [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> got me off my ass; it was <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> lit a fire under me, <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> made me think, [...] "Hey, I could be a filmmaker."

500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, like most of <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E

Scheyer played a prank after Duke's win. [...] He tweeted his more than 6,700 Twitter followers: [...] "Hollerrrrr at me!!! 847-970-....!".

Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life.

Executive producer Jed Whedon [...] "astutely pointed out that the minor version was more satisfying than the major version", and so McCreary 'tweaked' the theme permanently into F minor. ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to use a full symphonic orchestra for every episode, and so there is [...] "a full section of brass that's pounding out his theme when he comes out in his heroic moments." [...] McCreary had to work harder than usual to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. To accompany the main theme, McCreary wrote an ostinato [...] "that doesn’t draw as much attention to itself as a full-blown melody. I use this catchy little riff to build up steam before sweeping statements of the Main Theme." ...|$|E
