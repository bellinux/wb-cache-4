40|$|<b>Briefing</b> is <b>the</b> {{first and}} the most {{important}} step in the design process, where the requirements of clients are defined and the objectives of the projects are identified. <b>The</b> <b>briefing</b> stage of construction projects has become the focus of design management research in the last two decades. It is because <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process is both critical to the successful delivery of construction projects and problematic in its effective. One of the problem areas is the inadequate involvement of relevant stakeholders. However, little attention is given to the management of multiple stakeholders in <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. This paper introduces stakeholder management in <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. It describes the importance of managing stakeholders in the early phase of the project and presents the methodology of analysing stakeholders to identify stakeholders, assess their needs, wants, commitment, interest and power as well as how to manage them. It concludes that managing multiple stakeholders is essential to the success of <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. By so doing, the needs of all the stakeholders including the clients can be identified and clarified, making <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process more effective and efficient.

50|$|In an emergency, {{flight attendants}} {{are trained to}} calmly {{instruct}} passengers how to respond, given the type of emergency.Research conducted at the University of New South Wales Australia questions {{the effectiveness of these}} briefings in conveying key safety messages for passengers to recall and act upon in an emergency. In one study, a range of pre-recorded safety briefings were tested. One safety briefing contained humour, another was void of humour (said to reflect a standard style briefing), and another used a celebrity to sell the importance of <b>the</b> safety <b>briefing</b> and <b>the</b> messages contained within. Not long after being exposed to <b>the</b> <b>briefing,</b> individuals recalled approximately 50% of the key safety messages from <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> featuring <b>the</b> celebrity, 45% from <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> containing humour, and 32% from <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> void of both a celebrity and humour. Two hours post exposure to the pre-flight safety briefings, recall decreased on average by 4% from the original levels across all conditions.|$|R

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of <b>the</b> <b>brief</b> surfeit of prey.|$|E
