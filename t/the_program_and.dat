5|$|Scandal erupted when Teller (and his {{associate}} Lowell Wood) {{were accused}} of deliberately overselling <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error.

5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM.

5|$|The {{government}} {{felt the}} contractors could not complete <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> instructed them to repay {{most of the}} $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>program</b> (<b>and</b> PAVN air defences) evolved, so did {{the relay}} aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> the Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E

Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he only has to pay $5,000 for the privilege.|$|E

An emergency meeting was held by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in which the case was discussed with experts and information collected from hospitals. Video retailers all over Japan removed the Pokémon anime from their rental shelves.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E
5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> <b>and</b> assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E
