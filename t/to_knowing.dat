25|$|According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, {{the central}} {{difference}} between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches <b>to</b> <b>knowing.</b> Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal. Philosopher and physicist Victor J. Stenger's view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches of knowing {{and the availability of}} alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.|$|E

25|$|A {{great deal}} of testimony, some the most {{dramatic}} of the proceedings, concerned a reputed diary that Giuliano kept, naming the powerful politicians with whom he collaborated.

None of the accused admitted <b>to</b> <b>knowing</b> what became of Giuliano's journal. Testimony concluded late in 1951, and in May 1952 twelve defendants, including Terranova and Pisciotta, were sentenced for life; four were given shorter sentences, and the remainder were acquitted.

She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E
