5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958.

Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 <b>to</b> <b>restore</b> his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored. In the 1990s, the former site of the murals was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E
