5|$|In 1995, Dunst co-starred in {{the fantasy}} {{adventure}} film Jumanji, {{loosely based on}} Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 book of the same name.

5000|$|During dicing, wafers are {{typically}} mounted on dicing tape {{which has a}} sticky backing that holds the wafer on a thin sheet metal frame. Dicing tape has different properties depending on <b>the</b> <b>dicing</b> application. UV curable tapes are used for smaller sizes and non-UV dicing tape for larger die sizes. Once a wafer has been <b>diced,</b> <b>the</b> pieces left on <b>the</b> <b>dicing</b> tape {{are referred to as}} die, dice or dies. Each will be packaged in a suitable package or placed directly on a printed circuit board substrate as a [...] "bare die". The areas that have been cut away, called die streets, {{are typically}} about 75 micrometres (0.003 inch) wide. Once a wafer has been <b>diced,</b> <b>the</b> die will stay on <b>the</b> <b>dicing</b> tape until they are extracted by die-handling equipment, such as a die bonder or die sorter, further in the electronics assembly process.|$|R

At <b>the</b> <b>DICE</b> Awards, it was nominated for Game of the Year, Action Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, Outstanding Technical Achievement and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition. At the BAFTA Game Awards, Far Cry 4 received five nominations including best game design and best story eventually winning for best music. The game won Game of the Year and Art Direction, Contemporary (Jean-Alexis Doyon) in 2014 by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) and received six nominations: Use of Sound, Franchise (Yassine Abouelfalah), Sound Editing in a Game Cinema (Ding Jun Mei), Graphics, Technical (Danny Deslongchamps), Game, Franchise Action (Cedric Decelle), Game Design, Franchise (Gauthier Malou) and Direction in a Game Cinema (Sébastien Bergeron).|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they roll <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E

5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

30|$|Dicer 1 is a {{critical}} enzyme controlling the synthesis of miRNAs. In <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> 1 null cells, the decrease of miR- 290 cluster miRNAs increased the expression of retinoblastoma-like 2 protein (Rbl 2) which suppressed the expression of DNMTs (Benetti et al., 2008). RT-PCR data showed that <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> 1 mRNAs mainly existed in fully grown oocytes and sharply decreased at the 2 -cell embryo stage, indicating that Dicer 1 exerted functions as a maternal effector. When conditionally knocking out of Dicer 1 in growing oocytes, <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> 1 null oocytes were mainly arrested at metaphase of the first meiosis (MI) stage (Murchison et al., 2007). Knocking out of <b>Dicer</b> 1 induced <b>the</b> high expression of mouse transposon (MT) and SINE elements B 1 and B 2 (Murchison et al., 2007), which may be induced by abnormal DNA methylation pattern in Dicer 1 null oocytes (Jeong and Lee, 2005). There is still no information about <b>the</b> effect of <b>Dicer</b> 1 on early embryo DNA methylation dynamics, however, knocking down of Dicer 1 could reduce the protein level of pluripotency factor Oct 4 (Cui et al., 2007), indicating the pivotal roles of Dicer 1 in preimplantation embryo development.|$|R

25|$|Once in control, a {{contestant}} {{could either}} roll <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> himself/herself or pass {{them to the}} opponent. After rolling, the contestant had to remove one or more digits from the board that added up to the total on <b>the</b> <b>dice.</b> For example, if a 10 was rolled, the contestant could remove any available combination that added up to that number: 1-9, 2–8, 3–7, 4–6, 1–2–7, 1–3–6, 1–4–5, 2–3–5, or 1–2–3–4, providing {{that none of the}} digits within the combination had already been removed.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is a gene -silencing {{mechanism that}} {{plays an important}} role in gene regulation in a number of eukaryotic organisms. Two core components, Dicer and Argonaute, are central in the RNAi machinery. However, the physiological roles of Dicer and Argonaute in the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii have remained unclear. Here, the roles of genes encoding Dicer (M. robertsii dclI 1 [Mrdcl 1] and Mrdcl 2) and Argonaute (Mrago 1 and Mrogo 2) proteins in M. robertsii were investigated. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> -like protein MrDCL 2 and Argonaute protein MrAGO 1 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in M. robertsii. <b>The</b> <b>Dicer</b> and Argonaute genes were not involved in the regulation of growth and diverse abiotic stress response in M. robertsii under the tested conditions. Moreover, our results showed that <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> and Argonaute gene mutants demonstrated reduced abilities to produce conidia, compared to the wild type (WT) and the gene -rescued mutant. In particular, the conidial yields in the Delta dcl 2 and Aogol mutants were reduced by 55. 8...|$|R
