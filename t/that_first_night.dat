Some managed to escape <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E

There they are soon reunited with Holly and Bluebell, who were with Bigwig in the Owsla. The two are nursing severe injuries which, they reveal, were inflicted as they escaped the violent human destruction of Sandleford and then later at Cowslip's warren. Holly also confesses that it was he who had tried to stop them leaving <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> but Fiver's vision coming true has left him a changed rabbit and he is there to join them in whatever way they will have him.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, the brigade, less its machine gunners, was {{relieved}} by the 5th Australian Brigade and sailed {{to the island}} of Lemnos to rest and recuperate. The regiment's strength was now just one officer and thirty-nine other ranks, twelve of whom were machine-gunners who had to remain at Gallipoli. By now, including the original contingent and their replacements, a total of thirty-two officers and 645 other ranks had served with the regiment at Gallipoli. On arrival the regiment came {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel George Stewart. By early October, replacements started arriving to bring the regiment back up to almost full strength. At {{the end of the month}} Stewart was evacuated sick, and Major John Studholme, the senior officer with the replacements, assumed temporary command of the regiment. On 10 November they returned to Gallipoli, camping <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> at Bauchop Hill.|$|E

5|$|<b>That</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> of my {{imprisonment}} was {{the longest}} night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Marie-Jos√© Malis toured, with a French-language version {{created with}} the help of Alain Badiou, {{explicitly}} asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part of the experience of the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether they had any suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play.

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] relate entirely to Harrison's {{situation}} on <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> in Los Angeles. He refers to fighting off sleep and recalls his advice to Taylor {{to ask a}} policeman for directions to Blue Jay Way. Author Jonathan Gould views the song as [...] "darkly funny", with the singer's concern over his friends' tardiness almost resembling [...] "a metaphysical crisis". In the choruses, Harrison repeatedly urges [...] "Please don't be long / Please don't you be very long", a refrain that Inglis identifies as central to the composition's [...] "extraordinary sense of yearning and melancholy".|$|E
500|$|The awards {{were to be}} made posthumously to John Simpson Kirkpatrick ("Simpson"), Albert Cleary and Teddy Sheean {{for their}} actions in the First and Second World Wars. Simpson's story has become an Australian legend. He was a {{stretcher}} bearer with the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance, Australian Army Medical Corps at Gallipoli during the First World War. He landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 and, on <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> took a donkey and began carrying wounded from the battle line to the beach for evacuation. He continued this work {{for three and a}} half weeks, often under fire, until he was killed. However, in 1919, [...] decreed that no more operational awards would be made for the recently concluded war.|$|E
500|$|The {{invasion}} commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, {{the flagship}} for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT {{was destroyed by}} shore fire, {{and he had to}} proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On {{the second day of the}} attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. [...] Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie [...] "Sands of Iwo Jima" [...] reprising his actions <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor.|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial ‚Äì I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perkins and {{his brother}} Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, {{starting}} on Wednesday nights during late 1946.

2500|$|Initially the Bergson Group largely limited its {{activities}} to Irgun fundraising and various propaganda campaigns. The outbreak of World War II saw a dramatic {{transformation in the}} group's focus. As information about the Holocaust began to reach the United States, Kook and his fellow activists became more {{involved in trying to}} raise awareness about the fate of the Jews in Europe. This included putting full-page advertisements in leading newspapers, such as [...] "Jews Fight for the Right to Fight", published in The New York Times in 1942, and [...] "For Sale to Humanity 70,000 Jews, Guaranteed Human Beings at $50 a Piece", in response to an offer by Romania to send their Jews to safety if the travel expenses would be provided. On March 9, 1943, the Group produced a huge pageant in Madison Square Garden written by Ben Hecht, titled [...] "We Will Never Die", memorializing the 2,000,000 European Jews who had already been murdered. Forty thousand people saw the pageant <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night,</b> and it went on to play in five other major cities including Washington, D.C., where First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, six Supreme Court Justices, and some 300 senators and congressmen watched it.|$|E
2500|$|Joy Division's Peter Hook, who saw {{the group}} in concert in Manchester in 1977, said: [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big {{influences}} [...] The Banshees first LP {{was one of my}} favourite ever records, the way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing". Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: [...] "Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting". The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something." [...] He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. [...] "On stage <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>night</b> with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure.

40|$|From the {{international}} Olympic Games to small-scale neighborhood street festivals, ephemeral events produce profound {{effects on the}} image of their host cities; in turn, these cities' images influence {{the character of the}} ephemeral events produced within the public realm. Boston's annual New Year's Eve celebration, <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> Boston, is among a small group of ephemeral events that significantly contribute to the image of the city. This thesis contains an analysis of the successes, failures, and challenges faced by <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> Boston over the past three decades. Through an analysis of <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> financial records, event siting, attendance, programming, and in-depth qualitative interviews with key informants, I examine the growth of <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> Boston from a grassroots New Year's Eve celebration on and around Boston Common to one of the largest New Year's Eve events in the world, and the subsequent scaling back of the celebration after the millennium. I trace how <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> constituency and mission has changed throughout this process, specifically focusing on how changes in funders' priorities and shifting interpretations of <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> four pillars have caused <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> programming to become dominated by community arts groups and youth artists rather than professional artists and performers. I frame this discussion by profiling other cities' <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> celebrations and several of Boston's other ephemeral events. (cont) My appraisal of <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> strengths and shortcomings equips me to examine the challenges and opportunities facing the celebration as it grapples with an expected expansion towards the Boston Harbor waterfront. I provide recommendations regarding how such an expansion can be designed to maximize the quality of the celebration. Specifically, <b>First</b> <b>Night</b> should take advantage of the new Rose Kennedy Greenway, use outdoor programming to control attendees' movement throughout the celebration and to draw them towards indoor venues, engage the local cultural institutions and artist community in programming and planning for the expansion of <b>First</b> <b>Night.</b> I argue <b>that</b> <b>First</b> <b>Night's</b> organizers should reframe the upcoming expansion as an exercise in urban planning and design in which the network of indoor and outdoor venues and interstitial spaces are considered holistically, rather than considering events individually. by Ben Stone.
