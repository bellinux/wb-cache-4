5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
6000|$|You {{will surely}} {{agree with me}} that <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind {{required}} for such a study as this, is the very same as is required for successful military study. In fact, I should say that the same intellect which would develop into a great military man, would develop also into a great naturalist. I say, intellect. The military man would require--what the naturalist would not--over and above his intellect, a special force of will, in order to translate his theories into fact, and make his campaigns {{in the field and}} not merely on paper. But I am speaking only <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind required for study; <b>of</b> that inductive <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind which works, steadily and by rule, from the known to <b>the</b> unknown; that <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind of which it has been said:--"The <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> seeing; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> knowing what we see; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> discerning differences and likenesses; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> classifying accordingly; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> searching for hypotheses which shall connect and explain those classified facts; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> verifying these hypotheses by applying them to fresh facts; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> throwing them away bravely if they will not fit; <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> general patience, diligence, accuracy, reverence for facts for their own sake, and love of truth for its own sake; in one word, <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> reverent and implicit obedience to the laws of Nature, whatever they may be--these are not merely intellectual, but also moral habits, which will stand men in practical good stead in every affair of life, and in every question, even the most awful, which may come before them as rational and social beings." [...] And specially valuable are they, surely, to the military man, the very essence of whose study, to be successful, lies first in continuous and accurate observation, and then in calm and judicious arrangement.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of the century, Wood was {{influential}} in changing <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E

25|$|Burns's worldly {{prospects}} {{were perhaps}} {{better than they}} had ever been; but he had become soured, and had alienated many {{of his best friends}} by too freely expressing sympathy with the French Revolution and the then unpopular advocates of reform at home. His political views also came to the notice of his employers and in an attempt to prove his loyalty to the Crown, Burns joined the Royal Dumfries Volunteers in March 1795. As his health began to give way, he began to age prematurely and fell into fits of despondency. <b>The</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> intemperance (alleged mainly by temperance activist James Currie) are said to have aggravated his long-standing possible rheumatic heart condition.|$|E
25|$|They are a {{hardy and}} useful {{aquarium}} fish despite having a coloration {{that is by}} no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank. Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind.|$|E
