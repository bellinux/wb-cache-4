50|$|The PACX was a {{centralized}} switch that allowed serial connections from end users {{to be connected}} to any {{one of a number of}} computers, typically mainframes. Users were equipped with small boxes with two <b>thumbwheels</b> on them, and by rolling the wheels to a given two-digit number they could select among the machines connected to the PACX. In typical setups, the PACX would be connected to computer terminals or modems. The switch box would be queried on connection for the user's selection, and then a direct connection would be made between the user and that machine. The system was not unlike the telephone network, and the name PACX was deliberately chosen to suggest a computer-side analog of the PABX market.|$|R

5000|$|Stroke {{counters}} help {{a player}} {{keep track of}} the number of strokes he or she has made during a hole, an entire round, or both. The simplest devices are strings of beads, <b>thumbwheels</b> or [...] "clickers" [...] that a player advances by one after each stroke and provide a total for the player to write on their scorecard after each hole; newer variations have various degrees of computational power added and can keep score for multiple holes, total scores, and keep track of over/under par statistics.

Counters by themselves are allowed under strict rules, but some multi-functional devices incorporate additional banned features like rangefinders or wind gauges, and as such the entire device becomes illegal.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{phones are}} mainly interacted with through buttons, <b>thumbwheels</b> or pens. However, mobile devices {{are not just}} {{terminals}} into a virtual world; they are objects in a physical world. The concept of Mixed Interaction Spaces (MIXIS) expands the interaction with mobile phone into the physical world [Hansen et al. 2005]. MIXIS uses the camera in mobile devices to track a fixed-point and thereby establishes a 3 dimensional interaction space wherein the position and rotation of the phone can be tracked. In this paper we demonstrate that MIXIS opens up for new flexible ways of interacting with mobile devices. We present a set of novel, flexible applications built with MIXIS and we show that MIXIS is a feasible way of interacting with mobile devices by evaluating a MIXIS application against a traditional mobile interface. Finally, we discuss some design issues with MIXIS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Mobile phones {{interactions}} are mostly done via the buttons, <b>thumbwheels</b> or touchscreens. Thus, in this s paper we present an approach for enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) on camera-equipped mobile phones. By using this approach a user {{is able to}} interact with an application by moving the mobile phone. The built-in camera is used to capture frame sequences while the movement and rotation are being estimated. The movement and rotation data are used as an input for the application. In our approach, we present some method to overcome the limitation of the mobile phone and further enhance the precision as previously reported by other researchers. The algorithm used in estimating the 3 D motion is the neuron network. To conclude, some examples of the implementations using the proposed approach are discussed in this work.

5000|$|The Afterburner greatly {{improves}} screen visibility at {{the cost}} of 25% to 30% battery life reduction, though this can be remedied {{with the use of a}} brightness control and extra capacity batteries. The Afterburner kit came with a <b>thumbwheel</b> potentiometer that could be installed to control the light's brightness. Another option was the Stealth Dimmer chip, created by Division 6. This chip let the brightness of the Afterburner be controlled using the Game Boy Advance's existing buttons, so there was no need to carve an extra hole in the case to mount a dimmer.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of PLCLogix {{is its ability to}} simulate real world manufacturing environments using interactive 3D animations. These interactive animations include bipeds and other avatars that operate in the various worlds. The integration of ladder programs with these 3D worlds provides a unique opportunity for programming in real-time and observing the operation of complex control devices and systems. Each of the 10 worlds in PLCLogix have interactive control panels which contain switches, pushbuttons, dials, levers, data input, <b>thumbwheels,</b> etc. The configuration of these control panels varies based on the operating requirements of the application. PLCLogix also includes a camera keypad with five camera views as well as a zoom function for all views. This allows the user to “move” around in the environment in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the PLCs operation in its virtual 3D environment.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports several {{results from}} an {{on-going}} research {{program designed to}} examine the utility of alternate input device technologies for 3 - dimensional (3 -D) computer display workstations. In this paper, operator performance levels on a 3 -D cursor-positioning task were compared using three input devices: (1) a trackball that allowed unrestricted (i. e., free-space) movements within the display space, (2) a mouse that provided selectable two-axis (i. e., plane) movements, and (3) a set of <b>thumbwheels</b> that provided separate controls for orthogonal single-axis (i. e., vector) movements. In addition, the input device evaluation was con-ducted for two operationally distinct 3 -D display techniques: (1) a linear perspective encoding of image depth information and (2) a field-sequential stereoscopic encoding of depth information. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} input device selection and general design considerations for the user interface to 3 -D computer workstations...|$|R
5000|$|Touchscreen PDAs {{intended}} for business use, {{such as the}} BlackBerry and Palm Treo, usually also offer full keyboards and scroll wheels or <b>thumbwheels</b> to facilitate data entry and navigation. Many touchscreen PDAs support some form of external keyboard as well. Specialized folding keyboards, which offer a full-sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport, are available for many models. External keyboards may attach to the PDA directly, using a cable, or may use wireless technology such as infrared or Bluetooth to connect to the PDA.

50|$|The disc {{could be}} sped up or slowed down via a <b>thumbwheel</b> {{next to the}} chord buttons to cause a {{corresponding}} change in tempo and pitch; however, faster speeds tended to roll off the lower frequencies, slower speeds rolled off the highs and moderate to slow tempo lent a slightly muddy quality overall. Natural imperfections on the celluloid discs as well as dust and dirt came through as scratches, clicks and pops, much like a worn phonograph record. Furthermore, the pitch change {{brought on by the}} tempo adjustment made session work with live musicians a difficult proposition, especially since the pitch varied greatly from disc to disc.|$|E
50|$|The {{new digital}} delay box timers used decimal or {{binary coded decimal}} <b>thumbwheel</b> {{switches}} to set countdown timer values in digital logic. The thumbwheels also fed back a visual numerical value that the race car driver could use to help him calculate proper settings. A popular early digital unit of this type was designed and produced by Robert Furrow (B. F. Electronics of Weatherford, Oklahoma). Robert Furrow's delay box utilized a quartz crystal for timing accuracy and Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits. Furrow's digital delay box was a substantial improvement in accuracy and ergonomics but suffered in reliability. In the United States many B.F. Electronics delay timers were sold Nationwide.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the first}} microprocessor based delay box timer {{was introduced by}} Richard Beutnagel (Thorn Microsystems in Rochester, NY). Richard Beutnagel's design also used a quartz crystal time base for accuracy but without the TTL glue logic.

The Thorn Microsystems design reduced parts count to [...] "one chip" [...] and one power transistor substantially reduced PCB (printed circuit board) solder interconnections for a significant enhancement in reliability. The firmware embedded within the Intel microcontroller chip performed all the timing and control functions required of the delay box with quartz crystal digital accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|One of the Jazzmaster's notable {{features}} is {{the pickup}} circuit featuring the unusual [...] "roller" [...] <b>thumbwheel</b> controls and slide switch {{at the upper}} neck end of the pickguard. The slide switch selects between two different pickup circuits, the [...] "lead" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] circuits. When the switch is in the lead position, the guitar's tone {{is controlled by the}} conventional tone and volume knobs and the pickup selector switch. When it is in the rhythm position, it selects the neck pickup only with the brightness rolled off slightly due to different values of the potentiometers (50k vs 1000k in the lead circuit), and the volume and tone are controlled by the two thumbwheels; the other controls are bypassed. The intention was that this circuit would allow the performer to quickly switch to a [...] "preset" [...] volume and tone setting for rhythm playing.|$|E
5000|$|From 1955 FED {{began to}} innovate, {{combining}} the rangefinder with the viewfinder in the FED 2 {{and all its}} successors. The FED-3 added slow shutter speeds and on the later version FED-3 (b) the film advance was changed from a <b>thumbwheel</b> to a lever. The FED 4 (1964 - 77) added a non-coupled selenium exposure meter. The FED 5 {{marked the end of}} the FED rangefinder family and was meant as a replacement for both the FED-3 and FED-4, which were in production {{at the time of its}} introduction. There were versions of the FED-5: the original FED-5 had an exposure meter, the FED-5B was a cheaper version without meter and the later FED-5C had reflected framelines showing field of view of 50mm lens and an exposure meter. All FED-5 cameras were delivered with an Industar I-61L/D lens. Production of FED rangefinder cameras ended in the mid 1990s (Fed-5 Serial Number 545446 was made on 28 February 1994; Fed's site claims that it was in fact 1997: [...] "Start of serial production of vertical drive for control system of tanks.
