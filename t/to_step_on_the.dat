Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} tank to explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of}} the Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides {{wrote that}} it was only {{permitted}} to enter the site to fulfill a religious precept. After the destruction of the Temple there was discussion as to whether the site, bereft of the Temple, still maintained its holiness or not. Jewish codifiers accepted the opinion of Maimonides who ruled that the holiness of the Temple sanctified the site for eternity and consequently the restrictions on entry to the site are still currently in force. While secular Jews ascend freely, the question of whether ascending is permitted is a matter of some debate among religious authorities, with a majority holding that it is permitted to ascend to the Temple Mount, but not <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of the inner courtyards of the ancient Temple. The question then becomes whether the site can be ascertained accurately. A second complex legal debate centers around the precise divine punishment for stepping onto these forbidden spots.|$|E

25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{names of}} University of Arkansas students, {{starting}} with the first senior class of 1876, are carved {{into one of the}} concrete walkways or sidewalks on campus. This tradition was started by the 1905 graduating class of students, who drew their names into the walkway in front of Old Main, the oldest building on campus. Following classes added their names {{for more than a decade}} and then the university took over responsibility for adding new classes, as well as adding the names of students who graduated prior to 1905. Through most of the 20th century, the names were impressed in wet cement using brass letters. As the campus grew, and the graduating classes got bigger, the operation became unduly time-consuming. In 1986, the university's physical plant developed a special machine called the [...] "Senior Sand Hog" [...] to engrave the thousands of names required each year. School superstition states that it is bad luck <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Class of 1900; additionally it is said that if one steps on the name of the first graduating class, you will never graduate from the University of Arkansas.|$|E

It has recently been suggested that these steps could provide important insights into the mechanism of polymer crystallization.

Here we examine this hypothesis by performing simulations of such temperature jumps using the Sadler-Gilmer model. We find that for this model the step profiles do reveal the fixed- point attractor. However, for temperature decreases they also reflect the rounding of the crystal edge that occurs in this model and for temperature increases they also reflect the fluctuations in the thickness present in the crystal. We discuss {{the implications of these}} results for the interpretation of experimental step profiles...|$|R
