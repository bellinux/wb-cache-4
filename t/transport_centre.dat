25|$|Public {{transport}} in Auckland, {{the largest}} metropolitan area of New Zealand, {{consists of three}} modes – bus, train and ferry. Services are coordinated by Auckland Transport under the AT Metro brand. Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> is the main transport hub.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the opening}} of Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre,</b> {{significant}} improvements {{have been made to}} commuter rail services. In October 2005, Sunday services were reintroduced {{for the first time in}} over 40 years, together with a general 25% service frequency increase at the time.|$|E

25|$|Commentator Brian Rudman {{noted that}} it would make the most sense for a new {{crossing}} to be dedicated to public transport only, possibly connecting with a rail tunnel from the Western Reclamation to Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre,</b> providing an alternate way of making Britomart a through station.|$|E
25|$|The Auckland Ferry Terminal is in {{downtown}} Auckland on Quay Street, between Princes Wharf and the container port, directly opposite Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre.</b> An underground pedestrian {{link between the}} two, to allow easier road crossing and protection from bad weather, was planned but not built due to cost reasons.|$|E
25|$|The Incheon International Airport Railroad airport express (or AREX, and styled as A'REX) {{station is}} located in the <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre,</b> {{adjacent}} to the main terminal building. It provides service to Gimpo International Airport and Seoul. Many of the stations along the AREX line provide connections to the Incheon Subway and Seoul Metropolitan Subway.|$|E

50|$|During the war, {{particularly}} {{in the early part}} of the Pacific campaign, the Townsville air base was crucial to fighting. Along with Darwin, the base was one of the principal air <b>transport</b> <b>centres</b> in Australia, an important air base of strategic value. It was also one of the few air bases in Australia from which fighter aircraft engaged enemy aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Springs {{is also a}} <b>transporting</b> <b>centre</b> {{with many}} <b>transporting</b> {{companies}}. Some of the more known companies include Van Heerden's Trucking company in Largo, an eastern suburb of Springs and Penta Trucking focusing on cargo transporting from Nuffield, Springs. Welthagen Transport in New Era specialises in bulk and container shipping and the Amalgamating Bulk carrier company from Welgedag, Springs concentrates on bulk transporting.|$|R
25|$|The war {{brought about}} {{major changes in}} the roles of the three airfields in the Brisbane area. Eagle Farm became {{established}} as Brisbane Airport for all international and major domestic aviation services due to its location close to the City and the Port of Brisbane. Archerfield receded into a secondary role as a commuter airport and freight <b>transport</b> <b>centre,</b> and Amberley evolved as the major military base for the RAAF.|$|E
25|$|Queen Street is {{the major}} {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the Auckland CBD, Auckland, New Zealand's main population centre. It starts at Queens Wharf on the Auckland waterfront, adjacent to the Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> and the Downtown Ferry Terminal, and runs increasingly more steeply uphill for almost three kilometres in a mostly straight south-southwesterly direction towards the Karangahape Road ridge, and the residential suburbs {{in the interior of}} the Auckland isthmus.|$|E
25|$|Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> is {{the public}} {{transport}} hub in the central business district of Auckland, New Zealand, and the northern terminus of the North Island Main Trunk railway line. It combines a bus interchange with a railway station in a former Edwardian post office, extended with expansive post-modernist architectural elements. It is {{at the foot of}} Queen Street, the main commercial thoroughfare of Auckland city centre, with the main ferry terminal just across Quay Street.|$|E

25|$|Auckland {{has four}} railway lines (Western, Onehunga, Eastern and Southern). These lines serve the western, {{southern}} and eastern parts of Auckland from the Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> in downtown Auckland, the terminal station for all lines, where connections are also available to ferry and bus services. Work began in late 2015 to provide more route flexibility and connect Britomart more directly to western suburbs on the Western Line via an underground rail tunnel known as the City Rail Link project.|$|E
25|$|Longford's {{main air}} <b>transport</b> <b>centre</b> is located {{south-east}} of the town, at Abbeyshrule, the local airport. Abbeyshrule Aerodrome receives a regular influx of small general aviation aircraft, including the Cessna 182 and 150. The airport also boasts two flight training centres; one for general aviation {{fixed wing aircraft}} training (Aeroclub 2000) and one for microlight aircraft flight training (Ultraflight). The airport is also {{the home of the}} Extra 200 aerobatic aircraft EI-SAM of acclaimed Irish international competition aerobatics pilot David Bruton.|$|E
25|$|The late 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries saw {{a large number}} of {{imposing}} buildings constructed, such as the Smith & Caughey's building, the Auckland Town Hall and the General Post Office at the waterfront, later to become the Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre.</b> By that time, the street was popular for events such as parades and festivities, as well as for political activities such as the strike demonstrations of 1913. During {{the second half of the}} 20th century, many of the older buildings on Queen Street were demolished to make space for larger office buildings.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} also home to the largest airport in Croatia—the Zagreb Airport. In April 2012, a 30-year {{concession}} contract to develop and manage the airport as a regional <b>transport</b> <b>centre</b> was signed by the Government of Croatia and Zagreb Airport International Company Limited. The only navigable river in the region is the Sava, downstream of Sisak. The navigable route became disused after onset of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, and it has not been fully restored {{since the end of the}} war, limiting the size of vessels that may reach Sisak.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the concept}} to make the new quarter more interesting, as well as accessible, a new tram circuit was {{constructed}} around the quarter, using two heritage trams on a 1.5km $8 million clockwise track. It is hoped that the tram line will later be extended, to serve transport as well as tourist functions for the quarter. Such a link, initially to the Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> was originally intended to form {{part of the}} initial works, but the global financial crisis scuttled plans to make the new Wynyard Crossing substantial enough to also serve trams, though the foundations for the interim bridge will be sufficient for a later bridge upgrade.|$|E
25|$|Other buses {{depart from}} stops on {{surrounding}} streets, {{some of which}} are up to a block away from the station. The lack of more integrated bus facilities {{has been the subject of}} criticism, particularly due to the fact that the original design for the <b>transport</b> <b>centre</b> included an underground bus station, which was cut from the final design due to costs and the bus operators' preference for above-ground bus facilities. Until early 2016, buses arrived at and departed from Queen Street in front of the station building, but that portion of Queen Street is currently closed to vehicular traffic while trench works for the City Rail Link take place.|$|E
2500|$|The vital {{industries}} and <b>transport</b> <b>centres</b> {{that would be}} targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. It could be claimed civilians {{were not to be}} targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as [...] "terror bombing", the concept of attacking vital war industries—and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale—was ruled as acceptable.|$|R

25|$|Rail {{services}} operate along four {{lines between}} the CBD and the west, south and south-east of Auckland, with longer-distance trains operating to Wellington {{only a few}} times each week. Following the opening of Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre</b> in 2003, major investment in Auckland's rail network occurred, involving station upgrades, rolling stock refurbishment and infrastructure improvements. The rail upgrade has included electrification of Auckland's rail network, with electric trains constructed by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles commencing service in April 2014. A number of proposed projects to further extend Auckland's rail network were included in the 2012 Auckland Plan, including the City Rail Link, rail to Auckland Airport, the Avondale-Southdown Line and rail to the North Shore.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} its 10-year plan, {{at that time}} being {{consulted}} on, would include funding for another study into a second harbour crossing. This study was declared to include the possibility of landing a future tunnel underneath the Tank Farm, with a connecting tunnel to south of Victoria Park. Costs are estimated at NZ$3 billion. Some commentators like Brian Rudman have noted {{that it would make}} the most sense to keep the new crossing for public transport only, possibly to connect with a rail tunnel to Britomart <b>Transport</b> <b>Centre.</b> This statement was largely supported by North Shore City mayor George Wood, who noted that public transport provision on the new crossing (including the possibility for light rail or heavy rail to connect to Britomart) had been part of North Shore City Council's plans for many years.|$|E
