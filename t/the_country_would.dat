5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E

5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was {{not satisfied with the}} reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Newfoundland Referendums of 1948 were {{a series}} of two referendums to decide the {{political}} future of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Before the referendums, Newfoundland was in debt and went through several delegations to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> join Canada, remain under British rule or regain independence. The voting for the referendums occurred on June 3 and July 22, 1948. The eventual result was for Newfoundland to enter Canadian Confederation.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing that African American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E

40|$|Mercosur: {{the dilemma}} between the customs union {{and a free}} trade area. In 2001, the {{government}} of Argentina - facing a major economic crisis - took a rather controversial decision and reduced the tariff rates of all capital goods to zero. This became a main source of conflict with Brazil, <b>the</b> only <b>country</b> of Mercosur that produces such goods. This paper discusses two possible scenarios for the resolution of this issue. In the first one, <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>would</b> opt for <b>the</b> maintenance of the customs union. The authors present some suggestions for the rebuilding of the Common External Tariff (CET), by which <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>would</b> take a middle course acceptable to all. The other possible outcome would be a step back {{in the direction of}} a free trade area, with no CET at all...|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Although Brunei first {{participated in}} the Summer Olympics in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, it was only {{represented}} by one official. It would not be until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> send athletes to the Games. Since then, it has participated in six Summer Olympic Games between its debut and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The country was the sole member of the International Olympic Committee {{not to participate in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; it had intended to do so, but was excluded {{on the day of the}} opening ceremony after failing to register any athletes. No Brunei athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2016 Rio Games.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>would</b> not be able to participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> adopt the euro currency.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Boris I (r. 852–889) Bulgaria {{underwent}} major changes— the Christianization {{of the country and}} the admission of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which {{marked the beginning of the}} creation and consolidation of the medieval Bulgarian literature and alphabet. Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

5|$|The 1930 FIFA World Cup was {{the inaugural}} FIFA World Cup, the world {{championship}} for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> be slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan {{to join in the}} future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E

5|$|While burghs {{acted as}} centres of basic crafts. These {{included}} {{the manufacture of}} shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to inhabitants and visitors on market days. However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland {{for most of this}} period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> later be known. As a result, the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr.|$|E

5|$|Despite ongoing {{threats from}} the Khmer Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 {{percent of the}} vote, against 38.23 percent for the Cambodian People’s Party. Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen {{refused to accept the}} results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, {{announced}} the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the Cambodian People’s Party. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People’s Party so <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> not break up. On 21 September 1993, the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister, and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister. On 23 September 1993, the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state. In July 1994, the Cambodian Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea. By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved.|$|E
