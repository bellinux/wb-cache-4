5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> torsos, and sides. They also rub <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in many species are hooked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.|$|E

50|$|The kit {{is made by}} ISC. On {{the front}} of the shirt, Fly Emirates appears in the centre with Total {{appearing}} on the left sleeve and Matrix Networks appearing on the right sleeve. On the back of the shirt, Warrington Fabrications and University of Chester are at the top while Maxilead Metals appear at the bottom. University of Chester (who appear at the top of <b>their</b> <b>back</b> shirt) also appear on the right of their front shorts while Warrington Fabrications (who also appear at the top of <b>their</b> <b>back</b> shirt) also appear on the left of <b>their</b> <b>back</b> shorts while Matrix Networks (who appear on their right sleeves) also appear on the right of <b>their</b> <b>back</b> shorts.|$|R
50|$|Facing their {{opponent}}, the wrestler reaches {{between their}} opponent's legs {{with one arm}} and reaches around <b>their</b> <b>back</b> from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler lifts their opponent up and turns them upside down {{so that they are}} held up by the wrestler's arm cradling <b>their</b> <b>back.</b> The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on <b>their</b> <b>back.</b> The opponent will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer's thigh.|$|R
5|$|When the guecha warriors fought {{battles with}} {{neighbouring}} groups, {{most notably the}} Panche, and also against the Spanish conquistadors, they carried the mummies of their ancestors on <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> to impress the enemy and receive fortune in battle.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> {{to assist the}} rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> and kicking them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E

5000|$|When cats lie on <b>their</b> <b>back</b> with <b>their</b> belly exposed, {{they are}} in a {{position}} of vulnerability. Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust [...] or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.|$|R

5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. <b>Their</b> <b>backs</b> and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the two waterways. If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E

5|$|The skin of {{the adult}} cane toad is toxic, {{as well as the}} {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E
5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking their weapons and valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' hands behind <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They told the American POWs {{that they would be}} sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E
5|$|All {{bodies were}} in similar flexed {{positions}} lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt {{dating to the}} predynastic period are in a similar position, however at Merimda Beni Salama and El-Amra bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the Middle Kingdom period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> (dorsal position), and from the Fifth Dynasty the bodies were always fully extended.|$|E

5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the messages in the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early. When Galatasaray officials arrived at Elland Road {{for the second}} leg, hundreds of Leeds fans attacked the coach busses that were carrying them which delayed the kick-off of the second leg. During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans turned <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> on the match in protest of, what was viewed as, a lack of justice.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> {{shoulders}} and parts of wings. By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
