Adolf Hitler himself, according to his physician, was injected with testosterone derivatives to treat various ailments.

50|$|Currently used androgens {{for male}} hormone {{replacement}} therapy are typically injectable or skin delivery formulations of testosterone or testosterone esters. Injectable forms of testosterone esters (such as <b>testosterone</b> enanthate, <b>propionate,</b> or cypionate) produce undesirable fluctuations in testosterone blood levels, with overly high levels shortly after injection and overly low afterward. Skin patches do provide a better blood level profile of testosterone, but skin irritation and daily application still limit their usefulness.|$|R
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and <b>testosterone</b> <b>propionate,</b> and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E

In 2003, however, Salzgeber became mired in doping charges after Rusty tested positive for <b>testosterone</b> <b>propionate</b> at the 2003 World Cup finals, losing {{what would have been}} a third successive gold. Rusty's veterinarian claimed the drug was given to him to treat a hormonal imbalance, but the pair was banned from competition for two months by the German Equestrian Federation.

40|$|The binding of {{dexamethasone}} phosphate (DP) and <b>testosterone</b> phenyl <b>propionate,</b> (TPP) two semisynthetic steroids, to {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA) was studied by equilibrium dialysis method at 25 °C and pH 7. 4 {{with a view}} to have an insight into the competitive binding characteristics of these two drugs, when bound to BSA simultaneously. There was increase in free concentration of DP due to addition of TPP and vice versa during concurrent administration of these two drugs, thereby causing reduced binding of these two drugs to BSA.

In absence of the site I specific probe (warfarin sodium), DP after being displaced by TPP or vice versa from its high affinity binding site (site II) rebound to its low affinity binding site (site I) on BSA.

These changes in SHBG capacity were mirrored by a decrease in percent-free T (from 2. 64 +/- 0. 26 % to 1. 64 +/- 0. 16 %, P less than. 01) in the LPHC diet group and no change in percent-free T in the regular diet group (from 2. 36 +/- 0. 21 % to 2. 19 +/- 0. 10 %). The changes in SHBG capacity and percent-free T were not associated with significant changes in testosterone (T), free T, estradiol (E 2), thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroxine-binding globulin, or cortisol binding globulin levels. In a subsequent experiment, <b>testosterone</b> cyclopentyl <b>propionate</b> (TCP) was administered to six male rabbits while on regular rabbit chow and again after 6 weeks of the LPHC diet.

40|$|Androgens exert {{their effects}} on {{various parts of the}} body, {{including}} muscles, bones, hair follicles in the skin, liver and kidney, reproductive, hematic, immune and nervous systems. The effects are modulated by specific cellular "steroid-converting" enzymes, located inside target tissues. All the anabolic steroids currently used are derivates of testosterone or changes of its structure. The most important esterified forms of <b>testosterone</b> include the <b>propionate,</b> cipionate, enhantate and undecanoate ones. The mechanism of action of AAS has not been fully elucidated and it is currently subject of many studies. Several mechanism of action have been proposed to identify the path activated by AAS. Some, like oximetholone, does not bind the androgen receptors: it is assumed that these steroids act after a biological transformation into more active compounds. The 5 alpha-reductase, for example, plays a central role in their mechanism of action; on the other hand, aromatase is responsible for the conversion of AAS in female sex hormones such as estradiol and estrone, which bind to the estrogen receptor, forming estrogen-receptor complex. Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) are members of the superfamily of nuclear and steroid receptors. In particolar, the functions of the androgen receptors (hAR) involving transciption factors are generally regulated by specific steroid ligands, that is androgens and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) ...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Depot' drug {{formulations}} {{are created}} by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs {{the action of the}} drug. The two primarily used forms in the United States are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and testosterone enanthate (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. Testosterone enanthate is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250–1000mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50–100mg/week). These testosterone esters are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. Testosterone enanthate costs more than testosterone cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the United States. Testosterone cypionate is more popular in the United States than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders). Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the United States. A formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe and the United States, testosterone undecanoate (Nebido, Aveed) [...] provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4mL of oil which may require multiple simultaneous injections. Testosterone undecanoate is also much more expensive as it is still under patent protection. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>propionate</b> is another testosterone ester that is widely available, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but it is very short-acting compared to the other testosterone esters and must be administered once every 2 or 3 days, and for this reason, is rarely used.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To analyze {{histological}} {{aspects of}} ovaries {{as well as}} the ovulation of adult mice treated with the anabolic agent hexestrol. Methods: Thirty adult mice were divided into three groups of 10 animals each: (GI) the animals received a dose of 3 mg/kg of hexestrol; (GII) the animals were given a dose of 6 mg/kg of hexestrol; (GIII) the animals were injected with distilled water (vehicle). Another 10 -animal group (GIV) was included, and these mice were injected with <b>propionate</b> <b>testosterone</b> (1. 25 mg) after 5 days from the day of birth. Hexestrol was administered intraperitoneally once a day and the treatment lasted 30 days. the mice were then sacrificed; their ovaries and oviducts were removed, submitted to histological routine and analyzed under light microscopy. Results: in mice treated with hexestrol (6 mg/kg) (Group II), ovaries were smaller than those from the controls but highly vascularized; similar results were obtained in GIV. A great number of follicles in several stages of development were found however, with no corpora lutea - in six animals in GII No corpora lutea were found in GIV. the number of luteal bodies and oocytes in GII was lower than that in GI or GIII. No oocytes were detected in GIV. Finally, the nuclear volume of interstitial cells in GII and GIV was the largest. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the anabolic agent hexestrol in a high dose may decrease ovulation in mice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
