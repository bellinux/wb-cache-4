5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
5|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head the}} day after the party. As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> tears.|$|E

25|$|Freed from {{smoke and}} dirt, {{the living room}} thus began {{to serve as an}} area for social {{functions}} and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the servants, and the kitchen was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far from the dining room. Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the entrance hall.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scenes were}} {{shot in a}} three-story single-family house located at 671 Lincoln Avenue {{in the village of}} Winnetka. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the film was shot in the house, along with the main staircase, basement, attic and most of the first floor landing. The house's dining room, and all the downstairs rooms (excluding the kitchen) were {{duplicated}} on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew. The house was built in 1920 and features five bedrooms, a fully converted attic, a detached double garage and a greenhouse. The tree house in the back yard was built specifically for the film and dismantled after filming ended.|$|E

25|$|The {{four sets}} allowed for daily {{services}} {{in both directions}} to Trondheim, but only one direction each day to Bergen. NSB therefore decided in 1956 to order two more units, allowing for daily services also on the Bergen Line. NSB initially intended to order the new units with reversible seating and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the center car, but chose to retain the former layout in able to retain a universally interchangeable fleet to avoid complicating the booking process. However, the new units were delivered with doors {{on both sides of}} the train, compensated through and overall longer length and a tighter seat pitch. The two units were delivered in 1958 and first ran on 13 May. They were handed over to NSB on 31 May and 15 June, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Room two led to {{the toilets}} and {{contained}} a small room where food was served and a 17-man crew peeled potatoes for <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>In</b> late September 1933, {{in preparation for a}} large transport of 200 men, the guards' quarters and the infirmary were moved into the house, which had previously been empty. Afterward, the former infirmary became the main torture room and a new infirmary was set up in a walled-off section of room two. Of the prisoner housing, room one was considered the worst because there was an increased likelihood of attracting the attention of a passing SA man, an occurrence that could lead to immediate abuse. Most feared by the prisoners, however, were the torture rooms; the bunker, the freight elevator and the cubicles, where inmates were denied even the normal camp standards of meals, washing, toilets and the infirmary.|$|E
25|$|The eastward {{drawing room}} is adorned with themes from the Lohengrin legend. The furnituresofa, table, {{armchairs}} and seats in a northward alcoveis comfortable and homelike. Next {{to the drawing}} room is a little artificial grotto that forms the passage to the study. The unusual room, originally equipped with an artificial waterfall and a so-called rainbow machine, is connected to a little conservatory. Depicting the Hörselberg grotto, it relates to Wagner's Tannhäuser, as does the décor of the adjacent study. In the park of Linderhof Palace the king had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions. Opposite the study follows the dining room, adorned with themes of courtly love. Since <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> Neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room, {{it was impossible to}} install a wishing table (dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism) as at Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee. Instead, the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift.|$|E

500|$|The plain {{exterior}} is contrasted by {{the elegance}} of {{the interior of the}} house. The house has elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces. The floor plan is built around the central hall with an offset stairway. The parlor rooms to the right are separated by a wide archway. The two rooms to the left are a dining room and a pantry that has a dumbwaiter to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the cellar. The National Historic Register of Places nomination noted that the cellar contained the [...] "remains of the kitchen, washroom and wine cellar". The second floor is made of four chambers and the attic consists of five small rooms. The attic's rooms served as the servants' cubicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house is}} designed around a central hall with a narrow stairway with turned balusters and newel that goes to the third floor. [...] On both sides of the hall are two large front reception rooms, each [...] and having [...] tall ceilings. The rear of the south front room is the former dining room that is connected by a pantry to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> the ell. Two small rooms are located beyond the northern reception room. The second floor maintains the central hall and extends into the ell, but is bisected by a lateral hallway. Each [...] "quadrant" [...] housed two rooms for the residents with additional rooms in the ell and the third floor has four additional bedrooms with the dormer windows. The third floor of the ell was used as attic storage space. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the alterations that had been made to the house were described as [...] "minor and inconspicuous, consisting mainly of alterations to windows and dormers to provide egress to necessary fire-escapes." [...] The porch is believed {{to be a part of}} the original design, but it was noted that if it was a later addition it would likely have been done before 1920. In 1969, the clapboarded outbuilding to the southeast was torn down to construct newer housing for the elderly.|$|E

500|$|The stories {{begin with}} the Big Bang, and then moves to the Paleolithic Age, where it is {{revealed}} that Peter's ancestor invented the wheel. The second story sees another Moses {{as a member of}} the Griffin family during the Bronze Age leading the Israelites to freedom. The family soon discovers that Meg can fit through the vent, so they force Meg through the vent and into the kitchen. Peter uses a loud speaker to contact Meg from the panic room, therefore alerting the burglars to the fact that somebody is in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>In</b> order to take the family's mind off Meg being captured, Peter tells the story of Nate Griffin. Nate lived in the small village of Quahogsuana, but was captured by a white version of Cleveland Brown from South Carolina and taken to the United States. He, along with Quagdingo and Joe Mama, prank the ship captain. While sleeping, they push his bed into the ocean. Nate is caught after briefly escaping and forced to work on a plantation. He falls in love with the owner's daughter, Lois's relatives, and together, they bring up a secret family. After being discovered by his lover's father, the couple and their children escape, where Nate sets up the Department of Motor Vehicles to [...] "get back at the white man".|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to do a story set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make you really feel you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>in</b> which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job, and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about it for a while, Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E
