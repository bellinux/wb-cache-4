5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak {{into the kitchen and}} plants a hose in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking <b>the</b> <b>grease,</b> which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E

After loading it into Marge's car, two employees of The Acne Grease and Shovel Company steal it, claiming they control <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> and shoveling business in the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E
25|$|Lithography was {{discovered}} in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with a greasy crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by <b>the</b> <b>grease.</b> Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on <b>the</b> <b>grease.</b> Paper is than pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from <b>the</b> <b>grease,</b> thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies.|$|E
25|$|Spinning in <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> {{works best}} if the fleece is newly sheared. After several months, the lanolin becomes sticky, {{which makes the}} wool harder to spin using the short-draw technique, and almost {{impossible}} to spin using the long-draw technique. In general, spinners who use the long-draw technique do not spin in <b>the</b> <b>grease.</b>|$|E

25|$|Handspinners are split, when {{spinning}} wool, as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional spinners are more willing to spin in <b>the</b> <b>grease,</b> as it is less work to wash the wool after it is in yarn form. Spinners who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> covers the spinner's hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the spinner's hands.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard.

40|$|Abstrac: In {{this work}} {{lubricant}} degradation {{and its relationship}} with tribological behavior was studied. Commercial grease (Sintono Terra HLK) and three versions of a newly developed product (Tribolub) for the Metro system of Medellín city were studied. A twin-disc testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of degradation caused by either radiation or mechanical action on the tribological properties of the greases; also, a number of tests were carried out to learn about the changes in rheological properties of <b>the</b> <b>greases.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that tribological testing of degraded greases using a twin-disc machine and a subsequent viscometric analysis can be considered as a viable option to study performance of degraded greases used for wheel-rail systems. All <b>the</b> <b>greases</b> studied showed a decrease in their tribological performance after mechanical degradation in twin-disc testing machine, being the degraded Tribolub- 3 the one that allowed obtaining lower values of friction coefficient and mass loss of the samples. Both mechanical and radiation-induced degradation led to {{a significant increase in the}} viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>greases</b> studied, especially for low shear rates. FTIR analyses showed that such response was mainly caused by chemical changes in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>greases.</b> Viscosity-time curves showed a rheopectic behavior at low shear rates for Sintono Terra HLK and one of the versions of Tribolub, which was related to the particle contents and the effect of thickeners. Wetting tests showed better wettability for Tribolub than for Sintono Terra HLK, both before and after degradatio...|$|R

25|$|On 18 November 1987, {{the station}} {{was the scene of}} a devastating fire that killed 31 people.

25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it {{and use it as}} a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway's only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> covered rails to shunt a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|E

A spiral orbit tribometer (SOT) has been developed to conduct accelerated tests under realistic conditions.

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served thinly sliced on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid out on trays and waiters continued bringing out trays until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop.

Rumours began to circulate within the Bengal Presidency that <b>the</b> <b>grease</b> for the cartridges was made from a mix of lard from pigs and tallow from cows, and was therefore offensive to both Hindu and Muslim sepoy alike. These rumours reached Lieutenant Colonel George M. Carmichael-Smyth, in temporary command of {{the regiment}}, while he was on leave in Mussoorie. On his return to Meerut, Carmichael-Smyth received orders for the new drill, which applied to all weapons currently in use including those which did not take the new form of ammunition. Carmichael-Smyth modified the drill so that cartridges would be torn by hand, rather than biting.|$|E
