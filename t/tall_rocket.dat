40|$|A man-portable, {{autonomously}} controlled {{aerial surveillance}} platform has been developed. The {{ultimate goal is}} to provide a method for obtaining remote sensing data using an inexpensive, expendable device. The Autonomous Tactical Reconnaissance Platform (ATRP) consists of a standard parafoil that carries an instrumentation payload for autonomous flight and remote sensing capabilities for both military and civilian applications. The baseline design is for a device weighing less than 1. 5 lbs. that is launched to an altitude of 1000 ft, where it deploys and flies a user selected program of autonomous flight maneuvers for several minutes. Telemetry from the ATRP provides the user with real time output from onboard sensor instrumentation. An autonomous, fuzzy logic flight controller was developed to pilot the ATRP. A fuzzy logic architecture was optimized over a range of simulated flight conditions. The flight control algorithm provided a simple yet robust means of controlling the vehicle, thus enabling use of low cost, light weight components. Prior to launch the user selects one of a finite set of pre-programmed flight scenarios. After launch and deployment, the autonomous controller executes the pre-selected program of flight maneuvers as it glides in the descent phase. A 4 -ft <b>tall</b> <b>rocket</b> was designed and built to carry the 6 -ft wingspan parafoil and electronics package. Flight tests proved the launch system could successfully deploy the parafoil and activate the autonomous flight controller. The rocket was launched to altitudes above 500 ft allowing for up to one minute of flight time for the parafoil...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Rocky wore a <b>tall</b> metal <b>rocket</b> helmet with many {{different}} jumpsuit type outfits, including {{such items as}} bell-bottom pants.|$|R
60|$|It {{came from}} a <b>tall,</b> supercilious-looking <b>Rocket,</b> who was tied {{to the end of}} a long stick. He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.|$|R
50|$|A 1962 design proposal, Sea Dragon, {{called for}} an {{enormous}} 150 m <b>tall,</b> sea-launched <b>rocket</b> capable of lifting 550000 kg to low-Earth orbit. While the design was validated by TRW, the project never moved forward due to the closing of NASA's Future Projects Branch.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Arrow is a 16.5 m <b>tall</b> {{two-stage}} <b>rocket,</b> {{where the}} second stage is a three-person space capsule. The Canadian Arrow team's somewhat conservative approach has been to base the design of their rocket engine and aerodynamics on the well proven V-2 design from WWII.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Arrow is a 16.5 m <b>tall</b> {{two-stage}} <b>rocket,</b> {{where the}} second stage is a three-person space capsule. In a somewhat conservative approach, {{the design of the}} rocket engine and aerodynamics are based on the well proven V-2 design from WWII. The vehicle will launch vertically from the ground, on a sub-orbital trajectory, and will return to Earth via parachutes and make a water landing, similar to the splashdowns of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|On Thursday, 21 May 2009, NASA officially {{released}} Endeavour {{from the}} rescue mission, freeing the orbiter to begin processing for STS-127. This also allowed NASA to continue processing LC-39B {{for the upcoming}} Ares I-X launch, as during the stand-down period, NASA installed a new lightning protection system, {{similar to those found}} on the Atlas V and Delta IV pads, to protect the newer, <b>taller</b> Ares I <b>rocket</b> from lightning strikes.|$|R
50|$|India {{successfully}} {{launched its}} 16th remote-sensing satellite Oceansat-2 and six nano European satellites in 1,200 seconds {{with the help}} of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV- C-14) from Sriharikota on 23 September 2009. The launch was carried out as per schedule at 11.51 am and ended at 12.06 pm. The 44.4-metre <b>tall,</b> 230-tonne Indian <b>rocket</b> Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) freed itself from the launch pad at the spaceport and lifted itself up, lugging the 960-kg Oceansat-2 and the six nano satellites all together weighing 20 kg.|$|R
50|$|The Soyuz FG rocket {{carrying}} the Soyuz TMA-13M spacecraft was {{rolled to the}} launch pad at Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 26 May 2014. Under sunny skies, the roll out began at 7 o'clock in the morning. The rollout was attended by the Soyuz backup crew members, Anton Shkaplerov, Samantha Cristoforetti and Terry Virts. The Soyuz TMA-13M prime crew {{was not at the}} event, since it is considered to bring bad luck. Once the 49.5 meter <b>tall</b> Soyuz FG <b>rocket</b> was erected in its vertical launch position, the launcher was enclosed by its service structure, to provide protection and access platforms for workers.|$|R
40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to measure the sway of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center. This system was installed in the VAB and gathered more than one total year of data. The building movement was correlated with measurements provided by three wind towers {{in order to determine}} the maximum deflection of the building during high-wind events. The VAB owners were in the process of obtaining new platforms for use in assembling very <b>tall</b> <b>rockets</b> when analysis of the VAB showed that a high wind could move the building sufficiently that an upper platform might impact a rocket. The problem arises because safety requires a relatively small gap between the platform and the rocket, while a large enough gap is needed to ensure that stacking tolerances prevent contact between the rocket and the platform. This only leaves an inch or two (approximately 2 to 5 cm) of total clearance, so when the analysis showed that more than a couple of inches of motion could occur in a high wind, there was a potential for damaging the rocket. The KSC Applied Physics Laboratory was asked to install a system in the VAB that could measure the motion of the building in high winds to determine the actual building sway. The motion of the VAB roof under wind load was measured optically, and under analysis, it was determined that a relatively large-aperture optical system would be required to reduce diffraction effects to less than a small fraction of an inch (approximately mm) at a distance of 500 ft (150 m). A 10 -in. (approximately 250 mm) telescope was placed on the floor of the building, looking at the ceiling. On the ceiling, a flat plate with three white LEDs was mounted in an "L" shape, such that the telescope was essentially looking at three stars. Software was written to track the motion of these three points using an image processing system. This provided a better than 1 / 10 -in. (approximately 2. 5 -mm) 2 D measurement faster than once a second. Data was downloaded once a month for comparison with the wind tower data. The system was fully operational and provided enough data to show that the VAB will only move 1 in. (approximately 2. 5 cm) at the ceiling under 70 -knot winds. Adjustable platforms are not required...|$|R
50|$|In December 1957, ABMA {{delivered}} Proposal: A National Integrated Missile and Space Vehicle Development Program to the DoD, detailing their clustered approach. They {{proposed a}} booster {{consisting of a}} Jupiter missile airframe surrounded by eight Redstones acting as tankage, a thrust plate at the bottom, and four Rocketdyne E-1 engines of 360 to 380000 lbf kN. The ABMA team also left the design open to future expansion with a single 1500000 lbf kN engine, which would require relatively {{minor changes to the}} design. The upper stage was the lengthened Titan, with the Centaur on top. The result was a very <b>tall</b> and skinny <b>rocket,</b> quite different from the Saturn that eventually emerged.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time that ABMA was drawing up the Super-Juno proposal, the Air Force {{was in the midst of}} working on their Titan C concept. The Air Force had gained {{valuable}} experience working with liquid hydrogen on the Lockheed CL-400 Suntan spy plane project and felt confident in their ability to use this volatile fuel for rockets. They had already accepted Krafft Ehricke's arguments that hydrogen was the only practical fuel for upper stages, and started the Centaur project based on the strength of these arguments. Titan C was a hydrogen-burning intermediate stage that would normally sit between the Titan lower and Centaur upper, or could be used without the Centaur for low-Earth orbit missiles like Dyna-Soar. However, as hydrogen is much less dense than [...] "traditional" [...] fuels then in use, especially kerosene, the upper stage would have to be fairly large in order to hold enough fuel. As the Atlas and Titan were both built at 120" [...] diameters it would make sense to build Titan C at this diameter as well, but this would result in an unwieldy <b>tall</b> and skinny <b>rocket</b> with dubious strength and stability. Instead, Titan C proposed building the new stage at a larger 160" [...] diameter, meaning it would be an entirely new rocket.|$|R
5000|$|MidAmeriCon also {{presented}} another Worldcon first, a [...] "themed" [...] base {{used for the}} Hugo Award: [...] "The Dragon and the Rocket". Instead of being made out of finished wood in square or angled stacked shapes, as in the past, all bases were cast from flexible molds using a marbled effect achieved by combining contrasting tinted porcelain powder layers with resin and a hardener. When cured, a low-luster clear outer finish was then applied. Each example featured a sculpted, just-hatched dragon (representing the fantasy genre) wrapped half-way around each round 4.5" [...] tall base. The traditional 13" [...] <b>tall,</b> four-finned Hugo <b>rocket</b> (representing science fiction) was John Millard's newer 1973 design; a dozen examples had been machined from billet aluminum stock and then finished with an overall semi-gloss clear outer coat. The flat top of each base had a 4-inch diameter, quarter-inch thick, sand-blasted aluminum [...] "transition" [...] disk that each rocket sat upon. The rocket and disc where then friction tightened to the base through its center using a long threaded bolt and nut; each base's round, flat bottom was then covered with adhesive-backed black felt to hide the recessed attachment point. A curved black-and-silver engraved Hugo information plate was affixed by two screws to the base's side facing away from the wrapped dragon. The overall base design was by convention chairman Ken Keller, with the final finished design and casting master sculpted by three-time Hugo Award-winning fan artist Tim Kirk (who {{went on to win}} his fourth Hugo in the same category that year).|$|R
