The test results showed that <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>limited</b> cell is a possible means of developing a long-lived secondary cell. The cells were tested for 500 cycles using an accelerated regime approximating a 90 -minute orbit period. Three groups of ten cells were tested at 0, 25, and 40 C. The cycle data showed that <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>limited</b> cells had higher degradation rates at the higher operating temperatures. At the conclusion of 500 cycles, the three groups had average capacities of 16. 83, 12. 74, and 5. 71 ampere hours for testing at 0, 25, 40 C, respectively. The conditioning capacities of these cells was in the 25 ampere hours range.

40|$|AbstractTo ensure optimal {{sensitivity}} for mechanoelectrical transduction, {{hair cells}} adapt to prolonged stimuli using active motors.

Phosphate analogs interact with a 120 -kDa bundle protein, most likely myosin Iβ, {{in a manner that}} coincides with their effects on adaptation. Features of transduction following inhibition of motor force production suggest that the gating and extent springs of the hair cell orient in parallel at rest and that <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>limit</b> of adaptation arises when force in the stretched extent spring matches the force output of the adaptation motor...|$|R
