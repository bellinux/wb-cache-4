5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E

25|$|Professional {{development}} {{also became}} a concern. In 1984, NYSUT successfully pushed for passage of a state law creating and funding centers where teachers could obtain continuing education. In 1986, the union won passage of a bill creating mandatory mentor-intern programs in schools, so that established <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be able to mentor student-teachers during their internships in the public schools.|$|E

The [...] "teacher" [...] was then given a list of word pairs {{that he was to}} teach the learner. The teacher began by reading the list of word pairs to the learner. The <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> then read the first word of each pair and read four possible answers. The learner would press a button to indicate his response. If the answer was incorrect, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> administer a shock to the learner, with the voltage increasing in 15-volt increments for each wrong answer. If correct, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> read the next word pair.|$|R
25|$|The {{university}} was issued its second provincial charter in 1950. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s (following the Quiet Revolution) {{was a response}} to popular pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals as well as society. Its influence may be seen in when the {{university was}} issued its' third provincial charter, which was passed in 1967. It defined the Université de Montréal as a public institution, dedicated to higher learning and research, in the administration of which students and <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> have the right to participate.|$|E
25|$|McNabb died in 1802 but it {{took another}} sixteen years before the school opened it doors after much debate about {{how to use the}} bequest. It was in 1815 that the Rev. Andrew Mylne, Minister of Dollar, along with fellow Trustees {{conceived}} of a great academy to educate the boys and girls of the parish, and also pupils from outside Dollar, who would board with teachers. Full fees would be charged to ‘non-residenters’, while parish pupils would pay fees on a sliding scale, with some receiving free education. To attract pupils from outside the parish, excellent <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be appointed.|$|E
25|$|During both {{world wars}} {{the site was}} used as a {{military}} hospital, with up to 200 beds and more than 5000 patients receiving treatment between 1941 and 1945. In 1943, the Board of Education had begun to consider the future of education, following reforms that would inevitably come after the war ended. It was estimated that with the raising of the school leaving age, following the 1944 Education Act, about 70,000 new <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be needed annually, almost ten times as many as before the war. In 1944 a report was produced by the Board of Education on the emergency recruitment and training of teachers, and it was decided that there were to be several new training colleges set up. These colleges were to be staffed by lecturers seconded from local authorities, with mature students selected from the national service. The City of Manchester was no exception, and a search was undertaken for suitable accommodation for a new emergency training college. In 1945, the theological college, which was no longer required by the Wesleyans, was leased to the Manchester Education Authority, and the new emergency training college was officially opened on 31 January 1946, with Alfred Body as the first principal.|$|E

40|$|This Internship {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). In this paper I have discussed about grammar teaching by using inductive method, and also compared between Inductive method and Deductive Method. Inductive method is an easy and interesting method for the teachers. It is the method where the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> give the examples of any grammatical rules, and students would practice the examples. After that the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> show the grammatical rule or structure of the given example. On the other hand, Deductive Method is opposite of inductive method. In this method, the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> show any grammatical rules or structures and then he/she would give some examples. I have also discussed {{about the relationship between}} these two methods, but the main focus of this paper is on the Inductive Method. Nusrat Masud KhanB. A. in Englis...|$|R
500|$|The Independent {{reported}} that Moffat [...] "stresses that Chalk is a sitcom, not some banner-waving, agitprop pamphlet", {{but is still}} [...] "passionate about education".

[...] Moffat expected that <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> find the show funny because it [...] "has certain notes of accuracy", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> [...] "also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' but I hope they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. Why take it seriously?'

[...] The King hoped that these <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> [...] "render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside".

500|$|... "I Am Furious (Yellow)" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Chuck Sheetz. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on April 28, 2002. The episode's storyline was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} series, would usually tell the writers about how he was the class clown and did not pay attention in school, and yet grew up to become very successful. After hearing this, Selman thought that if Groening went back to his school to talk about his career, it [...] " [...] the last message that a principal and the <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> wanna hear." [...] Selman pitched the story because {{he thought it would be}} [...] "humorously infuriating" [...] to teachers. The episode was also partly based on some of the Simpsons staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln, both of which were created by Mike Reiss.|$|E
500|$|At {{no time in}} {{his life}} did Mercator claim to be a Lutheran but there are many hints that he had sympathies in that direction. As a child, called Geert, he was {{surrounded}} by adults who were possibly followers of Geert Groote, who placed meditation, contemplation and biblical study over ritual and liturgy—and who also founded the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at 's-Hertogenbosch. As an adult Mercator had family connections to Molanus, a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also he was a close friend and correspondent of Philip Melanchthon, one of the principal Lutheran reformers. Study of the bible was something that was central to Mercator's life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days, doubts which some of his <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the theologians at the university, amongst whom were two senior figures of the Inquisition, Jacobus Latomus and Ruard Tapper. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E

50|$|Vocal range {{itself does}} not {{determine}} a singer's voice type. While each voice type does have a general vocal range associated with it, human singing voices may possess vocal ranges that encompass more than one voice type or are in between the typical ranges of two voice types. Therefore, voice teachers use vocal range as only one factor among many in classifying a singer's voice. More important than range in voice classification is tessitura, or where the voice is most comfortable singing, and vocal timbre, or the characteristic sound of the singing voice. For example, a female singer may have a vocal range that encompasses the high notes of a mezzo-soprano and the low notes of a soprano. A voice <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> therefore look {{to see whether the}} singer were more comfortable singing higher, or lower. If the singer were more comfortable singing higher, then the <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> probably classify her as a soprano. The <b>teacher</b> <b>would</b> also consider the sound of the voice; sopranos tend to have a lighter and less rich vocal sound than a mezzo-soprano. A voice <b>teacher,</b> however, <b>would</b> never classify a singer in more than one voice type, regardless {{of the size of the}} vocal range of the singer.|$|R
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{stressed}} the school's reliance on Neill as a charismatic figure, which begat doubts of the institution's general replicability. Sarah Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) asked whether <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> have the [...] "time, patience, and personality" [...] to use Neill's methods. [...] "Their extremes of endurance may sometimes sound masochistic", wrote D. W. Harding (New Statesman), and Richard E. Gross (The Social Studies) added that Neill's [...] "extremes ... {{go far beyond}} good sense". Danica Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) concluded that the school's lessons curbed the child's sense of social responsibility and other society-preserving functions. Jacob Hechler (Child Welfare) said that what Neill described as love—a combination of [...] "caring and noninterference"—was very hard to bring to bear. The New Yorker called Neill [...] "a fiery crusader" [...] with [...] "deep understanding of children", and Morris Fritz Mayer (Social Service Review) read Neill as having the [...] "wrath and eloquence of a biblical prophet" [...] with a belief in children and [...] "unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education" [...] that [...] "one cannot help admiring". Willard W. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) positioned Neill as closer to a psychotherapist than a teacher, especially as the philosophy undergirding Summerhill [...] "derives from Freud". Gene Phillips (The Annals of the American Academy) described Neill as the [...] "essential ingredient of the democratic ethic that ... America needs".|$|E

2500|$|Abbott {{introduced}} {{two bills}} in 2004: the School Amendment Act, a government bill, expanded {{the responsibilities of}} teachers to include participation in curriculum development, assistance in developing provincial exams, and supervision of student teachers; {{the effect of this}} was to prevent teachers from withdrawing these services in work-to-rule situations. [...] The bill also amended the process by which it was decided whether suspended <b>teachers</b> <b>would</b> be dismissed or permitted to return to the job. [...] The bill passed the legislature. [...] Abbott's second bill of 2004, the Insurance (Demerit Offences) Amendment Act, was a private member's bill that never reached second reading.
