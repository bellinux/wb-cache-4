5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges began <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> {{west to the}} steppe {{near the}} Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due to pressure from the Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and forced them <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> west as well.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, in {{an attempt}} to fill the {{shortfall}} of workers and revitalise local industries, citizens of the wider Commonwealth of Nations were encouraged <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to Oldham and other British towns.

Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> into {{central and southern}} Florida. In the early nineteenth century, African-American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida, including hundreds in the 1820s, to evade American slavers.|$|E

5|$|When Lake Cahuilla filled, it {{may have}} {{encouraged}} Quechan people <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to the area.

5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to the sea, {{as seen in}} other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|Another feature {{introduced}} in Banjo-Tooie is the direct connections between its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively {{extensions of the}} Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy can be used <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customisable competitions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

Small groups of Khairwar tribesmen are said <b>to</b> <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> the Mirzapur {{district in the}} 18th century. They are now entirely separate from their parent community, now speaking Hindi. The Khairaha are now found mainly in Mirzapur and Allahabad districts.|$|R
5|$|Because of the colder climate, ectothermic {{reptiles}} {{are all but}} absent, {{with two}} species of garter snake and the western painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist. Similarly, only six species of amphibians are documented, although those species exist in large numbers. After a forest fire in 2001, a few park roads were temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> to other areas.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and seagrass beds, as well as nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable <b>to</b> <b>migrate</b> the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E

40|$|Human nasal polyps {{outgrowth}} culture {{were used}} to study the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to respiratory cells. By transmission electron microscopy, bacteria associated with ciliated cells were identified trapped at the extremities of cilia, usually as aggregates of several bacterial cells. They were never seen at the interciliary spaces or attached along cilia. Bacteria were also seen <b>to</b> adhere <b>to</b> <b>migrating</b> cells of {{the periphery of the}} outgrowth culture. Using a model of repair of wounded respiratory epithelial cells in culture, we observed that the adhesion of P. aeruginosa <b>to</b> <b>migrating</b> cells of the edges of the repairing wounds was significantly higher than the adhesion to non-migrating cells and that adherent bacteria were surrounded by a fibrocnectin-containing fibrillar material The secretion of extracellular matrix components is involved in the process of epithelium repair following injury. To investigate the molecular basis of P. aeruginosa adhesion <b>to</b> <b>migrating</b> cells, bacteria were treated with a fibronectin solution before their incubation with the respiratory cells. P. aeruginosa treatment by fibronectin significantly increased their adhesion <b>to</b> <b>migrating</b> cells. Accordingly, we hypothesize that during cell migration, fibronectin secreted by epithelial cells may favour P. aeruginosa adhesion by establishing a bridge between the bacteria and the epithelial cell receptors. Such a mechanism may represent a critical step for P. aeruginosa infection of healing injured epithelium...|$|R
