40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with spatial effects of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market for residential property and time varying relationships using a dataset of properties from the Adelaide metropolitan area, Australia, during the period 2002 – 2011. The analysis firstly considers the spatial dependence in <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market and secondly extends the analysis to a space-time model using 2 SLS regression. The findings demonstrate the complexity in spatial analysis with results indicating a random distribution of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market in 86 % of observations a pattern that is consistent over time. Spatial autocorrelation is shown to increase <b>time</b> <b>on</b> {{the market in the}} subject property while spatial error decreases <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market in the subject property suggesting a high level of market transparency and improved liquidity. The compensating or nullifying effects of both types of spatial association is shown to contribute to the random distribution observed in <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market. A strong explanatory capacity of the business cycle suggests that economic drivers are leading <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the market rather than prices...|$|R

40|$|Time plus energy equals learning. Efficient time-management {{skills are}} {{critical}} for students and professors alike. Allocating realistic amounts of time means effective learning for students and effective teaching for faculty. How an institution defines time expectations for students, faculty, administrators, and other professional staff can establish the basis for high performance for all. The fifth principle for good practice in undergraduate education is almost a truism: good practice emphasizes <b>time</b> <b>on</b> task. In their original statement of the seven principles, Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson expressed this as a mathematical formula: “Time plus energy equals learning. ” <b>Time</b> <b>on</b> task is a principle that applies to all persons within, and all components of, an institution. Any consideration of the principle {{within the context of}} legal education therefore should consider student <b>time</b> <b>on</b> task (learning), faculty <b>time</b> <b>on</b> task (teaching), institutional <b>time</b> <b>on</b> task (devoted to teaching and learning), and <b>time</b> <b>on</b> task within legal education (focusing law schools on teaching and learning) ...|$|R
