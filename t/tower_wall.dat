25|$|Gamla Nature Reserve {{is an open}} {{park with}} the archaeological remains of the ancient Jewish city of Gamla— {{including}} a <b>tower,</b> <b>wall</b> and synagogue. It is also {{the site of a}} large waterfall, an ancient Byzantine church, and a panoramic spot to observe the nearly 100 vultures that dwell in the cliffs. Israeli scientists study the vultures and tourists can watch them fly and nest.|$|E
25|$|The nave is 13th {{century in}} origin, but was rebuilt in the 14th. At {{the west of}} the north wall is part of a 12th-century window, now blocked and not visible outside, abutted to the <b>tower</b> <b>wall.</b> The north wall window is 19th century within a 14th-century opening. At the east of the nave is an arch leading to the north transept. This {{chamfered}} arch was reused when the nave was widened in the 14th century, and is supported by semi-octagonal responds added in the 19th. The nave south wall arch to the south transept is 13th century, chamfered, with square responds. Between this transept arch and east wall is a blocked 15th-century doorway that led to the loft above a former rood screen. The part-restored south three-light window is late 15th century, but using some material from the 13th. To {{the west of the}} window is the south doorway with moulded arch and hood mould. Between the south door and the <b>tower</b> <b>wall</b> is part of a 12th-century window, blocked, as mirror image to that on the north wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} work {{to repair the}} site began in 1950 that {{concentrated}} {{on the walls and}} tower {{under the direction of the}} DGMEN Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate on Buildings and National Monuments). In the following years there was work leveling the ground, re-construction of the <b>tower</b> <b>wall.</b> During this period, there was surveys of the land around the site. Subsequent years (1957-1959) included restoration of the walls, the keep tower and consolidation of the foundations, that included cleaning and landscaping.|$|E

2500|$|Corsehill House {{is shown}} in one old print of 1789 by Grose with the comment that [...] "At a small {{distance}} from this ruin are some small remains of a more ancient building belonging to the same family." [...] referring to the old Corsehill castle whilst drawing Corsehill House, {{the home of the}} laird at that time. Substantial remains of Corsehill House existed until the railway was constructed and most of the ruins were used to build the embankment with the course of the burn also being partly altered at this time. Armstrong's 1775 map clearly shows Corsehill as being on the east bank of the Corsehill Burn. The single section of <b>tower</b> <b>wall</b> that remains today (2006) of Ravenscraig / Old Corsehill was extensively repaired to stabilise it and this gives it its unusual appearance, accentuated by the existence of a fireplace on the eastern side. No explanation for the carrying out of these quite extensive and expensive repairs has yet come to light.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, almost inch by inch, {{and with}} a {{suspense}} that was agonizing, we crossed some twenty or thirty feet above {{the top of the}} wall. I could see as we came near the jagged line of white patches where the heads of the massacred Turks placed there on spikes in old days seemed to give still their grim warning. Seeing that they made in themselves a difficulty of landing on the wall, I deflected the plane so that, as we crept over the wall, we might, if they became displaced, brush them to the outside of the wall. A few seconds more, and I was able to bring the machine to rest with the front of the platform jutting out beyond the <b>Tower</b> <b>wall.</b> Here I anchored her fore and aft with clamps which had been already prepared.|$|E

60|$|The besiegers {{held the}} bridge, and some strong towers upon the bridge; {{and here the}} Maid of Orleans {{attacked}} them. The fight was fourteen hours long. She planted a scaling ladder with her own hands, and mounted a <b>tower</b> <b>wall,</b> but was struck by an English arrow in the neck, and fell into the trench. She was carried away and the arrow was taken out, during which operation she screamed and cried with the pain, as any other girl might have done; but presently {{she said that the}} Voices were speaking to her and soothing her to rest. After a while, she got up, and was again foremost in the fight. When the English who had seen her fall and supposed her dead, saw this, they were troubled with the strangest fears, and some of them cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on a white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for the French. They lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their chain of forts on fire, and left the place.|$|E
