25|$|The {{sentinel}} {{hypothesis of}} REM sleep was {{put forward by}} Frederick Snyder in 1966. It {{is based upon the}} observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. <b>This</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of maria erupted within, or flowed into, the low-lying impact basins on the lunar nearside. However, it is {{unlikely}} that a causal relationship exists between the impact event and mare volcanism because the impact basins are much older (by about 500 million years) than the mare fill. Furthermore, Oceanus Procellarum, which is the largest expanse of mare volcanism on the Moon, does not correspond to any known impact basin. It is commonly suggested that the reason the mare only erupted on the nearside is that the nearside crust is thinner than the farside. Although variations in the crustal thickness might act to modulate the amount of magma that ultimately reaches the surface, <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain why the farside South Pole-Aitken basin, whose crust is thinner than Oceanus Procellarum, was only modestly filled by volcanic products.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{link the}} origin of Brahmi to Semitic script models, particularly Aramaic. The explanation of how this might have happened, the particular Semitic script and the chronology {{have been the subject}} of much debate. Bühler followed Max Weber in connecting it particularly to Phoenician and proposed an early 8th century BCE date for the borrowing. A link to the South Semitic script, a less prominent branch of the Semitic script family has occasionally been proposed but has not gained much acceptance. Finally, the Aramaic script being the prototype for Brahmi has been the more preferred hypothesis because of its geographic proximity to the Indian subcontinent, and its influence likely arising because Aramaic was the bureaucratic language of the Achaemenid empire. However, <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain the mystery of why two very different Kharoṣṭhī and Brahmi scripts developed from the same Aramaic. A possible explanation might be that Ashoka created an imperial script for his edicts, but there is no evidence to support this conjecture.|$|E

Assuming the Solar System passed through part of the cloud, IDPs in the inner Solar System may have been dragged to Earth, while dust and small meteoroids in the asteroid belt up to centimeter size may have been dragged to the resonances, where their orbital eccentricities were pumped up into Earth-crossing orbits; however, <b>this</b> <b>hypotheses</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> explain the Popigai and Chesapeake Bay impacts...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{incorporate}} a precise {{description of the}} molecular mechanism involved. As a remark, the “cellulose-tension” may not be understood necessarily as a contraction of the cellulosic crystal itself but as any mechanism leading to the axial contraction of the cellulosic framework; while the “lignin swelling” can refer more generally to any physicochemical process provoking an increase of internal pressure of the amorphous compounds that occupies the space between crystalline parts, presumably induced by an irreversible deposition of lignin–hemicelluloses compound. The unified hypothesis underlines the necessity for both mechanisms to happen during the cell wall maturation process, either simultaneously or in succession. Collaboration between mechanics, anatomy, and biochemistry is necessary to elucidate the generation process of maturation stress in the cell wall and to clarify the exact content of both theories constituting the unified hypothesis.|$|R

40|$|A {{small number}} of {{mammalian}} loci exhibit genomic imprinting, in which only one copy of a gene is expressed while the other is silenced. At some such loci, the maternally inherited allele is inactivated; others show paternal inactivation. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain how this genetic system could have evolved {{in the face of}} the selective advantages of diploidy. In this study, we examine the variance-minimization hypothesis, which proposes that imprinting arose through selection for reduced variation in levels of gene expression. We present an evolutionary genetic model incorporating both this selection pressure and deleterious mutations to elucidate the conditions under which imprinting could evolve. Our analysis implies that additional mechanisms such as genetic drift are required for imprinting to evolve from an initial nonimprinting state. Other predictions of <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> appear to fit the available data as well as predictions for two alternative hypotheses, genetic conflict and the ovarian time bomb.

40|$|Most men {{and women}} are {{employed}} in occupations largely dominated by people of their own sex. Since occupational aspirations have proven to predict future labor market behavior it is of importance to study young boys’ and girls’ occupational preferences. With the use of a survey based on Swedish 15 -year-old children this study examines the association between the gender composition of parent’s occupation and the gender composition of children’s most preferred occupation. Drawing from the sex-role model that emphasizes the importance of the same-sex parents in forming children’s preferences, this study has investigated whether the gender composition of mothers’ (fathers’) occupations has an impact on the gender composition of girls’ (boys’) occupational aspirations. In line with previous research, the sex-role model received support for girls. But the observed association between fathers and sons disappear upon adding control variables. It was also hypothesized that the mothers’ generation entry into high status occupation would make children more likely to also regard their opposite sex parents as a role model.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{literature}} survey into the consequences of hormone disrupting, and more in particular oestrogenic, substances for human health are summarized.

40|$|About 30 years ago, an {{autoimmune}} reaction was hypothesised in animal models of epilepsy {{and for the}} genesis of the 'mirror focus' in some patients with refractory epilepsy. However, <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attract attention among clinicians. During the 1950 s, cortisone and corticotropin appeared to be efficacious in some epileptic syndromes, but the link with the immune system was not made. Furthermore, controlled studies were not rigorously planned and the best dosage and schedule still remain unknown. Later, immune deficits were described in patients with epilepsy, but the origin (disease-related or treatment-related) of these deficits is still open. An immunogenetic predisposition was also described in these patients, but results were often contradictory. During the 1980 s, the successful use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in childhood epilepsies again suggested a possible autoimmune process in some patients. During the last few years, specific autoantibodies have been found in Rasmussen disease and other epileptic syndromes. Immunomodulatory treatments (IVIg, plasmapheresis) have been used with significant success in refractory epilepsies, and IVIg is considered by most epileptologists as the first-choice treatment in Rasmussen syndrome. Recent work has shown that autoantibodies directed against some brain components might interact with ion-gated channels or neurotransmitters and therefore affect the stability of neuronal membranes. Autoimmune mechanisms are considered possible in the process of epileptogenesis. Taking <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> further, immunomodulatory treatment at the time of brain injury (such as by trauma, prolonged seizures or stroke) could offer a preventive approach against epileptogenesis and therefore prevent recurrent seizures...|$|R

50|$|The exact {{causes for}} the {{evolution}} of natal philopatry are unknown. Two major hypotheses have been proposed. Shields (1982) suggested that philopatry was a way of ensuring inbreeding, in a hypothesis known as the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis. He argued that, since philopatry leads to the concentration of related individuals in their birth areas, and thus reduced genetic diversity, there must be some advantage to inbreeding - otherwise the process would have been evolutionary detrimental and would not be so prevalent. The major beneficial outcome under <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is the protection of a local gene complex that is finely adapted to the local environment. Another proposed benefit is the reduction the cost of meiosis and recombination events. Under <b>this</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> non-philopatric individuals would be maladapted and over multi-generational time, philopatry within a species could become fixed. Evidence for the optimal-inbreeding hypothesis is found in outbreeding depression. Outbreeding depression involves reduced fitness as a result of random mating, which occurs due to the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes by combining allele that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> cross well with those from a different subpopulation. However, {{it is important to note}} that outbreeding depression becomes more detrimental the longer (temporally) that subpopulations have been separated, and that <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> provide an initial mechanism for {{the evolution of}} natal philopatry.|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{has been}} focused on the issue of nurses working within {{intensive}} care and on the impact of performing a job in this branch on their lifestyles. The jobs of nurses working within the intensive branches clearly belong among the demanding ones.

All of that and many other factors affect her personal and professional life, as well as her current lifestyle. To perform her job at as high level as possible, a nurse must be motivated and directed by management of the health centre, she must be educated enough in her branch and the job should be a hobby for her, where she must feel certain and safe and the job should satisfy her. This diploma thesis has defined three following intentions. The first one highlighted mapping of a lifestyle of nurses working within intensive care.
