5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that disciplinary {{action would be}} <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> Owen would be stripped of the captaincy. Owen, who was later released by the club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|During the 10th and 11th centuries Worcester spread north {{beyond the}} {{original}} burh walls, and south-east to form Sidbury. In 1041 Worcester {{was attacked by}} the royal army of Harthacnut over a tax-dispute that had led {{to the death of}} two of the king's men; despite the defensive walls, the city was successfully <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> burnt.|$|E
5|$|In August 1969, Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers {{made more}} dives during {{scientific}} {{studies by the}} Fisheries Research Board of Canada. They found very dense shoals of rockfish floating over Bowie's flat-topped summit {{and a variety of}} bottom life. A number of monochrome photographs were <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> a few seaweeds were collected, but no species record was created for other types of oceanic life around Bowie Seamount.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>take</b> <b>and</b> bake pizzeria, {{sometimes}} just {{known as a}} <b>take</b> <b>and</b> bake (or alternatively, take-n-bake), is a pizzeria which sells uncooked pizzas to customers, who then cook the pizzas at home in their own ovens.|$|R
5|$|Later Lowestoffe {{detained}} a Danish schooner sailing from Acuba to Jacquemel with a {{cargo of}} cattle.

5|$|Low budgets, generally: <b>Taken</b> <b>and</b> Paul Blarts stars, Liam Neeson and Kevin James respectively, are not {{considered}} A-listers, bankable enough to open a major movie {{on the strength of}} their names alone. Therefore, Meslow writes, they work for lower salaries, which helps keep budgets low enough for the film to be profitable with a smaller potential audience amid minimal competition.|$|E
5|$|Norwich, {{then one}} of the largest and most {{important}} cities in the realm, was <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of anyone they perceived as an enemy (such as poll tax collectors and important officials) once they managed to enter the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{central area}} of the ridge near Verrières Village was {{eventually}} <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> held by the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.

Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production; some 1500 deposits of £50,000 each were <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> deliveries were planned for 1992.|$|E
5|$|Weber's ideal {{bureaucracy}} is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated {{lines of}} authority in a fixed area of activity, by action <b>taken</b> (<b>and</b> recorded) {{on the basis of}} written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.|$|E

5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 3rd Parachute Division, {{along with an}} armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division, now joined {{the assault on the}} ridge. At 14:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion on the ridge's northern slopes once more came under attack. Although the infantry and armour closing in on the Polish positions were eventually repulsed, with a large number of prisoners being <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> artillery again causing significant casualties, the Poles were being gradually pushed back. However, they managed to retain their grip on Point 262N and with well-coordinated artillery fire continued to exact a toll on German units traversing the corridor. Another attempt was made to organise an attack towards Point 239 but the Germans were ready and the 9th Infantry Battalion's 3rd Company was driven back with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|A {{budget was}} {{prepared}} by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue. The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to Fortifikasjon. Main architects were Moe–Levorsen. A research group was created, which had four main tasks: ventilation, energy, fire and safety; the environment; rock mechanism and geology; and laws and regulations. The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally. In preparation for construction, drilling samples were <b>taken</b> <b>and</b> sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing. The rock is 800 to 1,100 million year-old gneiss which is well suited for creating caverns. Computer models were created, and estimates {{were based on the}} Q-method.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E

5|$|After Vatondas, Negroponte {{seemed about}} to fall into Licario's hands too. The city, however, was quickly {{reinforced}} by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian bailo, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except {{for the city of}} Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> Licario's ships raided the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was <b>taken,</b> <b>and</b> the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
