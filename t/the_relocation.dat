50|$|Another view is that, {{apparently}} {{confounded by}} the intractability of the Botswana government, Survival trained its guns on Botswana’s diamond industry. Survival {{points to a}} diamond prospect in the central Kalahari as the real reason behind <b>the</b> <b>relocations</b> and has identified De Beers as the main villain in this drama. However, the negotiating team, the diamond watchdog Global Witness, and Member of the European Parliament Glenys Kinnock have all {{said that there was}} no connection between diamonds and <b>the</b> <b>relocations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nash {{strongly}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> of South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney (renamed the Sydney Swans) in 1981, considering it {{a repudiation of}} the proud South Melbourne he had helped create.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> of the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979.

5000|$|In contrast, a Canadian Human Rights Commission report {{submitted}} in December 1991 {{argued that}} there was clear evidence that there were government concerns about Arctic sovereignty {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>relocations,</b> and an understanding that the settlements would contribute to Canadian sovereignty. The report concluded that the Government of Canada had broken its promise to return the relocatees to Inukjuak after two years if they wished.A further report, written by Trent University professor Magnus Gunther, examined the various claims of academics disputing what had occurred during <b>the</b> <b>relocations.</b> It concluded that the government had acted with humane intentions, and as a result Tom Siddon, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, stated that it would be [...] "inappropriate for the government to apologize" [...] or provide compensation.|$|R

5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E

5|$|Groundbreaking on the {{dam site}} {{occurred}} in May 1957 with <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> of the Western Pacific Railroad tracks {{that ran through}} the Feather River canyon.
