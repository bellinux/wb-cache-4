Lili also caused a little girl to be born in Massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date. Her mother named her after the storm, Lilly. <b>This</b> <b>girl</b> has grown with the fury and intensity of this storm.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} characters, {{and three of}} them {{basically}} {{changed the course of}} British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, and then I have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is <b>this</b> <b>girl</b> who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E

Upon meeting Jem, {{and listening to}} more of her demos, Flohr recalled thinking 'How do I not let <b>this</b> <b>girl</b> out the door without signing her?'. ATO Records quickly made the unanimous decision to offer her a recording contract. At that time {{there was no other}} label interest in her because her status as a studio only artist meant that she flew under the radar of most A She was subsequently signed to the label and on 13 October 2003 in preparation for the release of the full-length album, ATO released an extended play entitled, It All Starts Here..., consisting of five adapted demos that Jem had initially recorded.
