40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was multifold: it aimed to {{investigate}} similarities and differences between Chinese and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations,</b> to test the validity of the theoretical distinction between transactional talk and interactional talk, and to examine L 2 learners' use of the target language. Comparisons along four dimensions were conducted: (1) across languages [...] Chinese and English, (2) across functions [...] transactional and interactional talk, (3) across settings [...] China and the U. S., (4) L 1 vs. L 2 [...] English as native language and English as a second language. The data consist of natural <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> in Chinese and in English recorded by eighteen female participants (native speakers of Chinese and native speakers of American English) and interviews with the participants. Four sets of data were analyzed: Chinese <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in China, Chinese <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S., English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S., and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S. by native speakers of Chinese. The findings suggest that primary differences between Chinese and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> occur in identification, phatic talk, and leave-taking. Transactional calls and interactional calls display variation in greeting, phatic talk, initiation of closing, and register. The comparison of the use of language between the two settings reveals differences predominantly in transactional calls. The examination of L 2 discourse suggests that learners' communicative competence will be further enhanced with the promotion of sociolinguistic knowledge and pragmatic awareness of the communicative event...|$|R

5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld.

In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation</b> between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper.

5|$|On July 5, 2008, the Argentine journal Clarín {{reported}} about telephone wiretap records authorized for an anti-corruption investigation. Reporter Julio Algañaraz {{wrote that}} Carfagna and Silvio Berlusconi {{engaged in a}} <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation</b> with explicit allusions to oral sex. The wiretap transcripts have not been published, but the Italian newspaper La Repubblica interviewed the former vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and socialist executive Margherita Boniver, who admitted the existence of some messages. She later apologized to Mara Carfagna and the case was closed. Carfagna has instead sued for libel newspapers which had mentioned the alleged conversations and had shown some offensive statements. Following the reports, October 9, 2012 the Civil Court of Rome condemned Sabina Guzzanti to compensation of 40,000 euro to the former minister, ensuring, as all authorities, that those conversations never existed.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation.</b> According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation</b> and the glamour shot scenes.

5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation</b> with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of overlapping speech in different corpora of natural multi-party conversations, including two types of meetings, and two corpora of <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b> Analyses are based on forced alignment and speech recognition using an identical recognizer across tasks. Three results are discussed. First, all corpora show high overall rates of overlap, with similar rates for meetings and <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b> Second, speech recognition performance in non-overlapped regions of meetings is no worse than that in single-channel <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations,</b> while recognition in overlap regions degrades considerably. Finally, interrupt locations are associated with endpoints of word-level events in a speaker's turn, including backchannels, discourse markers, and disfluencies. Results suggest that overlap is an important inherent characteristic of conversational speech {{that should not be}} ignored; on the contrary, it should be jointly modeled with acoustic and language model information in machine processing of conversation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability to}} {{reliably}} infer {{the nature of}} <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> opens up a variety of applications, ranging from designing context-sensitive user interfaces on smartphones, to providing new tools for social psychologists and social scientists to study and understand social life of different subpopulations within different contexts. Using a unique corpus of everyday <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> collected from eight residences over the duration of a year, we investigate the utility of popular features, extracted solely from the content, in classifying business-oriented calls from others. Through feature selection experiments, {{we find that the}} discrimination can be performed robustly for a majority of the calls using a small set of features. Remarkably, features learned from unsupervised methods, specifically latent Dirichlet allocation, perform almost as well as with as those from supervised methods. The unsupervised clusters learned in this task shows promise of finer grain inference of social nature of <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|The current {{investigation}} contributes new data {{to a growing}} body of work on cultural universalities vs. particularities in the functions performed in telephone opening and closing sequences. While <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> in many languages and cultures have been studied, the Spanish language is conspicuously absent in the literature. The present work addresses this lack, augmenting available linguistic data with the novel contribution of Spanish to the database. In this presentation, I offer my analysis of the opening and closing sequences of 11 dyads in natural <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> conducted in Spanish. I attempt to determine how closely Hispanic cultural patterns of conduct for <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> follow the sequences outlined in previous works by Schegloff, Hopper, and other researchers. I conclude that Hispanic conversational norms do indeed fall within Schegloff’s canonical schema of universality, {{while at the same time}} exhibiting unique sequential variations. These variations may or may not be culture-specific, a point which can only be determined through further investigation...|$|R
