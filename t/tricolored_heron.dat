40|$|A {{search for}} {{suitable}} wintering sites {{on which to}} establish another migratory population of whooping crane (Grus americana) has been conducted and will continue. In addition to an evaluation of food availability for whooping cranes, wading birds that overlap highly in patterns of habitat utilization with whooping cranes may be useful as indirect indicators of suitable whooping crane habitat. We determined {{the extent to which}} several species of wading birds overlap in patterns of habitat utilization with whooping cranes on their current wintering grounds. We conducted aerial surveys of whooping cranes and wading birds at Aransas and Matagorda Island National Wildlife Refuges, Texas. We classified habitats used in order of increasing surface area as pools, ponds, lakes, and bays. We observed species which included whooping cranes (N= 638), great egrets (Casmerodius albus) (N= 987), great blue herons (Ardea heroidias) (N= 751), reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) (N= 301), snowy egrets (Egretta thula) (N= 155) and <b>tricolored</b> <b>herons</b> (Egretta <b>tricolor)</b> (N= 67). Specific overlap indices indicated that great egrets had the highest overlap with whooping cranes (0. 97), and <b>tricolored</b> <b>herons</b> also overlapped significantly (0. 87). Reddish egrets (0. 74), snowy egrets (0. 69), and great blue herons (0. 60) overlapped to a much lesser extent. We recommend that surveys conducted for the purpose of locating suitable wintering habitat for whooping cranes should focus on habitats utilized by great egrets and <b>tricolored</b> <b>herons...</b>|$|R

Briefly, the 1993 spring had abnormally high water and windy conditions throughout the season, and produced poor nesting effort, low to moderate nesting success, and low production of young. Some species, like Wood Storks and White Ibises, did not nest at all in the WCAs. Others, like Great Egrets and <b>Tricolored</b> <b>Herons,</b> showed considerably tenacity under the extremely poor nesting conditions.
