5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg {{argues that the}} orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, {{the crook of his}} arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wraxall's widow, Ursula, Lady Wraxall, {{was left}} with two {{children}} under two years of age, little income, and a large estate. Noted for her efficiency and practicality, when the clock tower, <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and wet rot, she simply had it disassembled, stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Inspector Morse TV series, {{the lead}} character, when seen at home, is often {{listening}} to music on his Xerxes. According to the manufacturers, the producers of the show deliberately sought to feature one in the series, from the first episode, to highlight Morse's passion for music. In the first episode, The Dead of Jericho, the people associated with the fictional manufacturer of the turntable (Richards Audio Research) were <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storyline.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{struggles with}} injury, Portland {{performed}} at a playoff level throughout the season.

Wesley Matthews also emerged {{in the absence of}} Brandon Roy, proving his worth as the Blazers' key off-season addition. Believing the team could make a significant run in the playoffs, Cho executed his first major trade on February 24, 2011, just seven minutes before the deadline. The Trail Blazers sent forward Dante Cunningham, center Joel Przybilla and center Sean Marks to the Charlotte Bobcats in return for former All-Star and All-Defensive forward Gerald Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the Palestinian {{refugees}} who fled or were expelled from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products they had lost {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an Palestinian state declared in October 1948, became <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian fedayeen activity. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E
5|$|Hastings was commemorated on {{the stone}} laid below the Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff {{by members of the}} New Zealand Railways Department.

Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key motivation in the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} season, McCoy led the Texas Longhorns {{to a perfect}} 12–0 regular season record, {{as well as a}} 13-12 victory over the Nebraska Cornhuskers to win the Big 12 Championship in Cowboys Stadium.

McCoy led a fast-paced offense, with accurate, short passes in his repertoire. The Texas offense executed a total of 1,053 plays in 14 games played in 2009. His favorite target was WR Jordan Shipley (#8), who went on to play in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E

The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. However, the Beast has little control over its rage and will likely destroy the world as well. The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero's father. The voice heard at Potos' waterfall was that of Serin's ghost.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E

5|$|Whitehall, {{a street}} that takes {{its name from}} the royal palace {{destroyed}} in 1698, is the ceremonial route linking Trafalgar Square with the Palace of Westminster and is lined with government buildings. It is also at the centre of the highest concentration of memorials in the City of Westminster, in which 47% {{of the total number of}} such works in the borough are located. The wider area of Whitehall also includes Horse Guards Parade, another important ceremonial space, and Horse Guards Road, which forms its western boundary with St James's Park. The area's monuments are predominantly military in character, foremost among them being the Cenotaph, which is <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national Remembrance Sunday commemorations held each year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|Built of limestone, {{in classic}} Palladian style, the {{southern}} façade {{takes the form}} of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken pediment supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken pediment sitting above a large Palladian window– <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|E

5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, Alex was {{introduced}} as a recruit at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia.

Despite clearing her name, she was fired from the Bureau {{and went on to}} join the CIA, where she was later named a fugitive for releasing classified U.S. intelligence to the public. The series focuses on her struggle to keep her country safe, while juggling her career and maintaining her on and off relationship with boyfriend Ryan Booth and her friendship with her best friend Shelby Wyatt. Originally conceived as a white character, Alex's characterization changed significantly following Chopra's casting, which came {{as a result of a}} talent holding deal ABC Studios had with the actress. Chopra had said that she saw this role as an opportunity to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States.|$|E
