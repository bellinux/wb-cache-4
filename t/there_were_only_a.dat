5|$|Like {{the earlier}} {{cyclones}} Meena, Nancy, and Olaf, Percy left widespread damage across Swains Island, Tokelau, {{and the northern}} Cook Islands. However, because of well-executed warnings, there were no deaths and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few injuries. Percy was the worst cyclone to strike Tokelau since a similar cyclone hit the area in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{was also}} the most {{damaging}} of the February cyclones as it battered the Cook Islands, which were still recovering from the impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings {{in anticipation of the}} storm, there were no deaths and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few injuries.|$|E

5|$|By 1910 <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 {{the island was}} finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number {{and the lack of}} a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of urban planning, Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem with}} the {{animation}} from the producers' point-of-view was {{that it did not}} exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E
5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
5|$|At 02:30 on 1 May, a C-47 of 317 Tactical Control Squadron USAAF {{departed}} for Rangoon carrying a twenty-man pathfinder team, {{followed by a}} CCG plane carrying a pair of VCP, to mark and defend the landing zone at Tawhai. The rest of the composite battalion boarded thirty-eight Dakotas and took off thirty minutes later, and at 05:45 jumped over the drop zone; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few casualties, one being a medical officer attached to the battalion. It encountered no Japanese opposition, and after it had rallied, advanced towards Elephant Point and the artillery battery. It halted 3,000 yards {{in front of the}} battery to allow B-24 Liberators from the USAAF to carry out a preliminary bombing attack on the battery. Unfortunately, despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves, C Company was bombed and strafed by the bombers, causing a number of casualties. As a result, a Forward Air Controller attached to the battalion ordered a halt to all further bombing runs on the battery.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people.

5|$|For both sides, Port Moresby was {{strategically}} important, {{offering a}} forward {{base from which}} to project further operations. Following {{the failure of a}} seaborne assault by the Japanese on Port Moresby resulting from the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and further losses during the Battle of Midway, it was planned to capture the town via an overland advance across the Owen Stanley Range along the Kokoda Track. On 21 July 1942, Japanese forces landed on the northern Papuan coast at Basbua, between Buna and Gona. The advanced landing forces, consisting primarily of the Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama's 15th Independent Engineer Regiment, sailed from Rabaul and came ashore unchallenged as <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small number of Australians stationed in the area. Shortly afterwards a small advanced element, supported by part of the 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, began moving south-west towards Oivi, mounted in motor vehicles and on bicycles. These troops were initially tasked with proving the route over the Owen Stanleys before {{the main body of the}} landing force, Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment, arrived.|$|E

5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions {{that there would be no}} Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E
5|$|The English and Dutch {{partitioned}} {{the island}} in 1614, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand {{and was able to}} dominate the whaling and fend off the English. The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited number of aggressive incidents. By the end of the 18th century, whaling had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction.|$|E
5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small number of defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Allies ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E

5|$|The area {{in which}} the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was {{inhabited}} for more than two thousand years by the Tequesta Indians. Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta, as the Europeans unwittingly brought with them diseases, such as smallpox, to which the native populations possessed no resistance. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their Calusa neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries. By 1763, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years' War. Although control of the area changed between Spain, United Kingdom, the United States, and the Confederate States of America, it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E
