40|$|Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP) {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{packaging}} trends in microelectronics. This technology also offers opportunities for highly miniaturized sensor packages including stress sensitive MEMS components. This paper describes the use of advanced molding techniques as compression molding for single and multi-chip embedding into a reconfigured wafer in combination with either standard thin film technology or large area and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing with a focus on integration of <b>through</b> <b>mold</b> <b>vias</b> for package stacking. One application scenario described here would be an electronic compass allowing indoor navigation in complex buildings with a smartphone. For this application the technology proof of concept is demonstrated with a functional two chip package consisting of an acceleration sensor and an ASIC. On top of this package a second wafer level embedded package is assembled containing a pressure sensor and an ASIC. Both WL packages are connected by <b>through</b> <b>mold</b> <b>vias</b> and soldered to a base substrate. The second application described the Fan-out Wafer Level packaging of a CMOS biosensor for integration into a microfluidic diagnostic platform. Here, FOWLP allows an easy integration into microfluidic channel with direct contact of the active sensor area into the microfluidics and sealing on the package fan-out area. By integrating through mold connection e. g. with trough silicon vias (TSV) dies electrical sensor signals can be routed to the backside of the module and hence giving a separation between “wet” microfluidic side and “dry” electrical connection. In summary this paper describes the opportunities of Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging for sensors and sensor systems backed by two successfully demonstrated applications from consumer MEMS and biomedical packaging...|$|E

The use of compression molding equipment with liquid or granular epoxy molding compounds for the targeted integration process flow is a new technology that has been especially developed to allow large area embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically 8 ? to 12 ?. The wiring of the embedded components in this novel type of SiP can be done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper (RCC) film is laminated over the embedded components. Also thin film redistribution technologies can be applied ? using similar processes as used for WLP on silicon. For the 3 D interconnection two technologies are evaluated: In a process flow similar to conventional PCB manufacturing vias are drilled using a UV laser after RCC lamination and are metalized in the same process as the vias for chip interconnection. A second via generation process uses vertical interconnect elements, e. g. silicon dies with well defined lead structures, assembled in the same process step as the embedded dies. Top and bottom surface of those vertical interconnect elements are exposed after mold embedding. Planar interconnection is then formed by thin film redistribution or after RCC lamination, the vertical interconnect elements are contacted using a µVia process. Within this study the different approaches to vertical interconnection in a mold embedded wafer have been intensively evaluated on their processability. A strong focus was put on the process chain chip placement on a temporary carrier - compression vacuum molding for embedding ? RCC lamination or thin film redistribution ? laser drilling processes for µVias & Thru Holes ? metallization structuring ? module singulation & 3 D assembly.

Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes the potential of advanced large area encapsulation processes for multi chip embedding in combination with large area and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing. PCB based redistribution offers the potential of real large area redistribution up to 610 x 457 mm² and the integration of <b>through</b> <b>mold</b> <b>vias</b> (TMVs) as both are standard features in PCB manufacturing. For the proposed combination of mold embedding and PCB based redistribution two process variations are introduced. The first approach starts with reconfigured wafer/panel assembly, encapsulation and PCB based redistribution with µvias for die interconnection. For the second approach dies are assembled face down on a Cu foil with an adhesive followed by an overmolding/ lamination step. The die interconnect is formed by a photolithography/etching step to open the Cu film at {{the locations of the}} die pads and the pads are connected by metallization afterwards. Process steps as assembly, encapsulation and redistribution on panel size are discussed in detail showing today’s possibilities.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-inPolymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. Mold embedding is currently done on wafer level, typically with diameters of 8 " to 12 ", for future process optimization, PCB technologies offer the potential of real large areas up to 610 × 457 mm 2. For mold embedding as e. g. for fan-out wafer level packaging compression molding equipment is used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet epoxy molding compounds, with the boundary condition, that mold processes do need a product specific tool (with defined diameter & thickness). Within this paper the potential of tool-less lamination processes, a standard in PCB manufacturing, is evaluated. Lamination is done in panel format using well-known molding compounds from wafer level compression molding. To evaluate the potential of today's encapsulants for large area embedding processes, different liquid, granular and sheet molding compounds have been intensively evaluated on their processability, on process & material induced die shift and on resulting warpage - all on panel level. Acting as an interconnection layer, PCB based redistribution technologies using lamination of resin coated copper (RCC) films are used. Within the paper, different RCC materials are introduced and discussed concerning their reliability potential based on the available layer thicknesses and thermo-mechanical material properties. The feasibility of the proposed technologies is demonstrated using a two chip package. Dies are embedded in panel size by lamination technologies. Subsequently the wiring is done by lamination of an RCC film over the embedded cmponents and on the panel backside for double sided redistribution. In a process flow also similar to conventional PCB manufacturing µvias to the die pads and <b>through</b> <b>mold</b> <b>vias</b> are drilled using a UV laser and are metalized by Cu-electroplating in one step. This way dies {{are connected to the}} front copper layer as well as front to backside of the panel. Conductor lines and pads are formed by Cu etching. Finally, a solder mask and a solderable surface finish are applied. If solder depots are necessary, e. g. for BGA packages, those can be applied by solder balling equipment - either by printing or by preform attach. In summary this paper describes the potential to move from wafer level to panel level mold embedding technology in combination with PCB based redistribution processes.
