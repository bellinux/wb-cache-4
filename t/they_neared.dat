5|$|In the afternoon, {{one company}} of the 2nd Scots Guards probed toward Bardia, the {{infantry}} coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> Sollum barracks. A group of Universal Carriers—commanded by Sergeant F. Riley—charged the gun positions and quickly neutralised them, but one carrier was disabled when the group was subsequently engaged by anti-tank guns. Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the Military Medal, the battalion's first decoration of the war.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1944 he {{collected}} a Mosquito from 21 Squadron and the Australian navigator Don Walsh and then flew to Norfolk to refuel at West Raynham. They {{took off and}} headed to the Danish coast. Out-to-sea he spotted, and was likely seen, by German coastal ships. As <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low. As <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not be done in time {{by the end of}} the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.|$|E

5|$|Reshef sent another tank {{company to}} rescue the infantrymen. The tanks {{advanced}} towards the Chinese Farm from the south. As <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the farm and the village, a downpour of anti-tank and artillery fire forced the company to retreat. Nathan kept pleading with Rehsef to send additional support, unaware he was facing superior Egyptian forces after entering the administrative bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. With no help coming, the unit commander had his men carry the wounded and attempted to leave the battlefield, tasking two sections of heavy machine guns with providing cover to the force. As the Israelis slowly made {{their way back to}} their lines, a group of Egyptian tanks intercepted and wiped out the Israeli force.|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this required them to plan for their next game as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} remained {{only marginally}} conducive {{for the development}} of thunderstorms on the morning of December30. Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Ozarks region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing. During the evening of December30, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development. Late that day, scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail. Over the next few hours and into December31, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes. The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06UTC on December31 as these storms tracked across the Ozarks. After a few hours, these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Although {{unknown to}} the Australians at the time, the earlier attack on Lang Phuoc Hai had been a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Viet Cong to provoke a reaction from 1 ATF. As such {{there would be no}} withdrawal on this occasion. Anticipating that any relief force would move by road, the Viet Cong had subsequently established an extensive ambush in the buildings alongside Route 44, which led into the village itself. Although the presence of this trap was not detected by the Australians, Murphy's evasion had ensured that his APCs had avoided it, moving the infantry by a cross-country route instead. However, with C Company delayed as a result, A Company made their airmobile assault onto an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, supported only by indirect fire from the artillery at Dat Do in suppression, which was initially limited due to delay in setting up the fire support base. Under the command of Major Owen O'Brien, A Company then began to advance into the fringe of thick rainforest to secure the southern edge of the landing zone for the arrival of B Company and the remainder of the battalion. Finally, over 30 minutes after the lead company had flown in, the APCs began to receive sniper fire as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{used the}} respite to ferry in {{additional}} reinforcements from Asia Minor and repair {{the walls of}} Blachernae. When Thomas returned in spring, he decided to focus his attack on the Blachernae sector. Before the offensive, Michael himself ascended the walls and addressed Thomas's troops, exhorting them to abandon their commander and promising amnesty if they would defect. Thomas's army viewed the plea {{as a sign of}} weakness, and advanced confidently to begin the assault, but as <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the wall, the defenders opened the gates and attacked. The sudden onslaught drove back Thomas's army; at the same time, the Imperial Fleet defeated Thomas's ships, whose crews broke and fled to the shore in panic. This defeat diminished Thomas's naval strength, and although he continued blockading the capital by land, the loss demoralized his supporters, who began defecting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's hands, resolved to desert Thomas, followed by a small band of men loyal to him. He departed the rebel camp, headed west, and sent a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops and killed the deserter.|$|E

5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E

25|$|In Namibia {{the dogs}} {{are being used to}} help protect {{livestock}} from cheetah attacks. Around 500 Kangals have been given to farmers in Namibia since 1994 by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and the scheme has proved so successful that it has been extended to Kenya. During the past 14 years the number of cheetahs killed by farmers is calculated to have fallen from 19 per farmer annually to 2.4. Livestock losses have been cut significantly at more than 80% of the farms where the dogs have been adopted. The great majority of cheetahs that are still killed by farmers are killed after specific attacks on livestock. Previously, the cats were tracked and killed whenever <b>they</b> <b>neared</b> a farm.|$|E
