25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} gone to war to defend Finland, {{there was no way that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for Norway.|$|E
500|$|Röhm {{was held}} briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler {{considered}} his future. In the end, Hitler decided that Röhm had to die. On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, [...] "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." [...] Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
60|$|This animal {{had grown}} very fat and super-contented, but I {{found that the}} family were in the {{condition}} of Gentleman Waife in Bulwer's novel, and were now wondering what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{experimental}} protocol was explained {{to a group}} of twelve nurses and twenty-one nursing students, who were asked to predict how many nurses would give the drug to the patient; ten nurses and all the nursing students said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Cook and Clifford told Fogerty {{that the}} fans {{would not accept}} [...] "Mardi Gras" [...] as a CCR LP, but he said, [...] "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs." [...] He gave them an ultimatum: either <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> or he would quit immediately. They {{accepted}} his ultimatum, but the album received poor reviews. It was a commercial success, however, peaking at #12 and achieving gold record status. It generated weaker sales than their previous albums. The group disbanded shortly afterwards. The only reunion of all four original members would be at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Doug and Stu played a 45-minute set at their 20th class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Doug would reunite again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion ...|$|E

50|$|In 2014, Cerro Porteño {{president}} Juan José Zapag {{spoke in}} reference to the corruption in Paraguayan football that various persons had complained to him about not buying games and that if his club were to win then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by buying and doping players to become champions.|$|R
6000|$|... (P. 82.) [...] That {{hardened}} villain was so {{far from}} denying it, that {{he said it was}} [...] true, and ---- him <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> still before they had done with [...] them.|$|E

60|$|And <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> And so {{soon as he}} had {{recovered}} from his surprise, and a little lessened the bleeding, he would explain to them how they had done it all wrong, and how easily he could have stopped the blow if they had only hit him properly.|$|E
5000|$|But {{the sound}} Marcel {{had at the}} show was not too exciting, severe {{problems}} with Jeff's microphone and some out of tune guitars needed some fixing.

60|$|It {{took two}} porters {{as well as}} the driver to hold him in at the station; and I <b>do</b> not think <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> even then, had not one of the men had the {{presence}} of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose, and to light a bit of brown paper.|$|R
5000|$|Wheeljack - Wheeljack and Arcee are two opposites of {{the same}} warrior. When Wheeljack almost {{abandoned}} the team, Arcee stepped in to help Wheeljack. They both went to get a Predacons bone and talk about Wheeljack's problem. Wheeljack had a little problem with his new commander, Ultra Magnus. But that wasn't the main problem, it was Bulkhead becoming [...] "soft". Wheeljack and Bulkhead used to be serious in the Wreckers and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> whatever <b>it</b> takes to complete their mission. Arcee told Wheeljack to not push Bulkhead away because she knows {{how it feels to}} lose a partner. Wheeljack was feeling a little better, thanks to Arcee's pep talk. After that, Wheeljack started to become a team player and has respect for Ultra Magnus and Bulkhead. Wheeljack and Arcee are like two lone wolves. They prefer to work alone, even though <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> whatever <b>it</b> takes to be a true team player on their team.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{thing the}} two old mates were agreed upon. No matter-what Dick's {{position}} {{might be in the}} college, his salary should be as large as that of any other professor.

6000|$|... "To see the Great World," [...] replied Old Mr. Toad. [...] "Foolish, very foolish of them, but <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I did {{the same}} thing myself when I was their age. Couldn't stop me any more than I could stop them. They don't know when they're well off, but young folks never do. Fine weather, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{would try}} to, anyhow," [...] Vincent said, smiling, [...] "and {{if it were}} {{possible}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> assuredly <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I was in Ashley's horse with the Stonewall division through the first campaign in the Shenandoah Valley and up to Bull Run, and after that under Stuart.

60|$|This was {{a terrible}} piece of news to poor Dick, and at first his heart fairly sank within him, but by degrees he came to be more hopeful.

60|$|Well, awhile after, {{the captains}} and stout ones {{of the town}} of Mansoul agreed and {{resolved}} upon a time to make a sally out upon the camp of Diabolus, and this must be done in the night; and there was the folly of Mansoul, (for the night is always the best for the enemy, but the worst for Mansoul to fight in,) but yet <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> their courage was so high; their last victory also still stuck in their memories.|$|E

25|$|The primary Scottish {{objective}} of ending the Union was now possible {{and they wanted}} to consolidate their position; although willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on their own.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} they saw all of Blacky's aunts and uncles and cousins flying over to join Blacky at the big pine {{in the midst of}} the Green Forest. Soon there was a big crowd of crows around the big pine, all talking at once. Such a racket! Such a dreadful racket!

60|$|As I {{continued}} to admire, the apologetics died away, {{and the good}} people began to brag of their barge, and their happy condition in life, {{as if they had}} been Emperor and Empress of the Indies.

60|$|Allie could {{scarcely}} credit {{the evidence of}} her own senses. Here she was alive! She tried to see and feel {{if she had been}} hurt.
