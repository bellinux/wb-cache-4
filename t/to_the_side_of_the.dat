5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, sharp bounds for cyclic sums of {{the ratio}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exradius <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a {{triangle}} are established {{depending on the}} circumradius and inradius of the triangle. The best possible parameters for the expressions of bounds are derived. Moreover, an alternative bound for the ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exradius <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> triangle, expressed by trigonometric functions, is also considered.|$|R
5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 a {{memorial}} to the demolished school was placed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clal Center, facing Jaffa Road. The memorial consists of a decorative iron gate etched {{with the name of}} the school in French. The gate is mounted between two stone pillars; it is not standing in its original location.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Richard and Edward {{were forced}} to flee to Burgundy in October 1470 after Warwick {{defected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou, {{and for a second}} time Richard was forced to seek refuge in the Low Countries, which were part of the realm of the Duchy of Burgundy. In 1468, Richard's sister Margaret had married Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Although only eighteen years old, Richard played crucial roles in the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury that resulted in Edward's restoration to the throne in spring 1471.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original structure and widening the roadways over the old footpaths. It is a bottleneck and becomes congested at peak travel times, and {{in the event of}} a breakdown or accident on the bridge, traffic in the area comes to a standstill. To resolve this problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} located on the London Inner Ring Road at the eastern end of Euston Road, next to the {{junction}} with Pentonville Road, Gray's Inn Road and York Way. To the west, at the other side of Pancras Road, is St. Pancras railway station. Several London bus routes, including 10, 30, 59, 73, 91, 205, 390, 476 pass in front of or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is rich in}} {{symbolism}} and iconographic elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, {{and on the other}} side a columbine, recalling the Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken {{to the point of}} being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E

Thus, the longest altitude is perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shortest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle. The altitudes are also related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle through the trigonometric functions.|$|R

5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence {{for this is that}} Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which {{does not necessarily mean that}} he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Further down, Ralf Schumacher took Zonta for {{eleventh}} {{place and}} Diniz passed teammate Salo for 14th position. Barrichello caught de la Rosa by lap twelve and passed {{him to take}} fourth and started to come under pressure from Frentzen. Herbert pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track with gearbox problems on lap 13. Barrichello passed Trulli for third position at the second corner two laps later. Barrichello became the first driver to make a pit stop by coming in on lap 17. Frentzen made his pit stop one lap later and re-joined in sixth place. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 1.4 seconds over Coulthard, who in turn was almost 22 seconds ahead of Trulli. de la Rosa was a further 2.1 seconds behind Trulli, and was being caught by Barrichello in fifth who set a new fastest lap, a 1:44.300. Villeneuve overtook Irvine to claim eighth place on lap 22.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher took {{an early}} pit stop on lap 34 {{and his team}} {{inspected}} his rear of his car {{as well as an}} adjustment to his front wing angle. He rejoined behind Barrichello, but ahead of Häkkinen who overtook Villeneuve on lap 35. Heidfeld pulled off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track with an engine failure on the previous lap after he made a pit stop. Alesi in the other Prost stalled at his pit stop and emerged in front of Irvine. Trulli became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 39. Alesi retired when his engine failed on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo pulled into retirement after his engine failed on lap 42. All of the drivers changed from dry to wet-weather tyres as rain began to fall from lap 42 onwards. Häkkinen was the final driver to pit on lap 46. Fisichella lost second position to Barrichello on the 47th lap after running wide.|$|E
5|$|On lap17, Massa and Hamilton {{were given}} drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen {{off the track}} into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track with engine {{problems}} and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.|$|E
