5|$|For {{the next}} seven years (1908–15) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, {{occasionally}} substituting for her father when he was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to n variables.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{his travels}} in the Malay interior, Skeat became <b>too</b> seriously <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> {{remain in the}} British Colonial Service, so he retired to London. In 1914, he became a {{lecturer}} at the British Museum.|$|R

He writes for the Commonweal {{sometimes}}, and sometimes he reviews books. 'E's got 'eaps of books--'eaps. Besides selling a lot.|$|R
25|$|Piccolomini {{was elected}} by accessus on the second scrutiny, taking the name Pius III after his uncle Pius II. The sixty-four-year-old Piccolomini was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> even <b>to</b> attend this scrutiny. Since {{he was only a}} deacon, Piccolomini was ordained a bishop by della Rovere, only to die on October 18.|$|R
5|$|Youngs's {{career was}} {{abruptly}} cut short in 1926, {{when he was}} diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection in 1924. <b>Too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw's insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927.|$|E
5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> {{return to}} school, but by early 1985 {{he began to}} feel better. His mother asked if he could return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> participate in the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, {{and not in the}} respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} been <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> for me <b>to</b> leave him," [...] he said, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "I spoke of him as my mate before, but he is my father." ...|$|R
50|$|Yejong of Joseon (12 February 1450 - 31 December 1469) was the 8th {{king of the}} Joseon Dynasty Korea. He succeeded his father, King Sejo in 1468 at 18 {{years of}} age (19 {{according}} to Korean system), but was <b>too</b> physically <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> govern, and died a year later.|$|R
60|$|Then by slow {{degrees and}} in broken words {{she told him}} enough {{of what she had}} learned to enable him to guess the rest, never dreaming, poor child, of the use to which he would put his knowledge, being <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> indeed <b>to</b> {{consider}} the possibilities of a future in which she could have no part.|$|R
5|$|Hasekura {{was baptized}} on 17 February by the king's {{personal}} chaplain, and renamed Felipe Francisco Hasekura. The baptism ceremony {{was to have}} been conducted by the Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, though he was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> actually carry this out, and the Duke of Lerma – the main administrator of Phillip III's rule and the de facto ruler of Spain – was designated as Hasekura's godfather.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill. There was {{blood in his}} sputum, {{but he seemed to}} recover, {{although}} he was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.|$|E
5|$|When Krohn {{stepped down}} as rabbi in 1953 due to poor health, the {{congregation}} had grown to 538 families. Krohn had also been active in interfaith work, and in June, 1958 was named Man of the Year by the National Conference of Christians and Jews at its annual dinner. He was, however, <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> attend, and died five months later.|$|E

5|$|Allen had {{initially}} intended to study {{to become a}} minister, but after his father became <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> work, he instead went into teaching. He {{became a member of}} Fruitful Vale All-Age's teaching staff at age 17. Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive formal training in teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation. Between 1979 and 1983, Allen served as the principal at a succession of schools; Robins Bay All-Age School, Hillside Primary School, and finally Port Maria High School.|$|E
5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
5|$|The Robins {{released}} Bancroft {{after the}} 1929 season, and {{he returned to}} the Giants as assistant manager and coach, serving under McGraw. He ended his MLB playing career in 1930. He remained as a coach, filling in for McGraw when he was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> manage. During the 1930 offseason, he led a team of MLB players on an exhibition trip to Cuba. When McGraw retired in 1932, the Giants appointed Bill Terry as player-manager. Surprised and disappointed that Terry was chosen over him, Bancroft left the Giants.|$|E
6000|$|Granville Kelmscott {{looked up}} at him in credulous surprise. But he was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> and weak <b>to</b> ask the meaning of this riddle. Montague Nevitt! What on earth could Waring mean by that? How on earth could Montague Nevitt have {{influenced}} and directed him in assaulting and murdering Montague Nevitt? ...|$|R
6000|$|Leicester was confounded, but {{the danger}} was urgent, and a reply {{absolutely}} necessary. [...] "The ladies," [...] he said, [...] "think too lightly {{of one of}} their own sex, in supposing she could deserve such a fate; or <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> of ours, <b>to</b> think it could be inflicted upon an innocent female." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a shame,--a great shame,--for you to say--such things," [...] said Linda, sobbing bitterly. [...] "No, I won't wait, I must go. I would sooner be dead than {{hear you}} say such things to me. So I would. I can't help it, if it's wicked. You make me say it." [...] Then Linda escaped from the room, {{and went up to}} her bed; and on the next morning she was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> either <b>to</b> eat her breakfast or to go to church.|$|R
5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|After {{the speeches}} Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan led a procession, which {{included}} the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol, where President Arthur received passing troops. Then, in the House Chamber, the president, his Cabinet, diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long read a speech written {{a few months earlier}} by Robert C. Winthrop, formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier, but now <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> personally deliver his speech. A final speech was given by John W. Daniel of Virginia. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} three years, all of Volkov's pictures {{were removed from the}} leading Russian museums. Indeed, until his death in 1957, the leaders of the Uzbekistan Union of Painters, after orders from Moscow, fully isolated Volkov from any contact with any painters, art critics and lovers of art who chanced to come to Tashkent. To anyone who wanted to meet Volkov, they declared that the painter was <b>too</b> severely <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> see them.|$|R
60|$|The juggler did {{not arrive}} on the {{following}} evening as he had expected, but {{late in the afternoon}} a native boy brought in a message from him, saying that his daughter was <b>too</b> shaken and <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> travel, but that they would come when she recovered.|$|R
50|$|His {{curiosity about}} {{pursuing}} a vocation was {{set aside for}} a couple of years. Instead he would concentrate in helping his family earn a living when their father became <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> and <b>to</b> work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left behind. In 1927, his sisters in America sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in Scranton, Pennsylvania. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.|$|R
5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had {{lost sight of}} each other and continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> <b>to</b> walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E
40|$|Computing {{solutions}} to real life scientific or engineering problem {{is most often}} the cheapest, fastest, safest and sometimes {{the only way to}} attack a problem. The computational bottleneck for solving the mathematical model built upon the real problem is most often the solution of a linear system, an eigenvalue or a singular value problem. In many instances the matrices that are involved in the computation are structured and {{it is not uncommon for}} the desired solution <b>to</b> be <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> conditioned <b>to</b> be computed with the traditional algorithms.

50|$|Working-class {{women often}} had occupations {{to make ends}} meet, and to ensure family income {{in the event that}} a husband became sick, injured, or died. There was no workers' {{compensation}} until late in the Victorian era, and a husband <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> or injured <b>to</b> work often meant an inability to pay the rent and a stay at the dreaded Victorian workhouse.|$|R
60|$|The poor Duke {{had no one}} to whom {{he could}} go for advice and consolation. When his son left him he turned to his newspaper, and tried to read it--in vain. His mind was <b>too</b> <b>ill</b> at ease <b>to</b> admit of {{political}} matters. He was greatly grieved by this new misfortune as to Gerald, and by Lord Silverbridge's propensity to racing.|$|R
