5|$|The Stamford branch plays Call of Duty {{under the}} guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) plays poorly and draws the ire of his teammates. As he leaves for home, Jim pretends to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> grenade at Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), who {{responds}} by creating a pretend explosion with paper clips. Karen longingly watches Jim leave.|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> disc through a hoop while {{avoiding}} full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics compared the game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, Blades of Steel, and Speedball, and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-game coin <b>toss,</b> <b>a</b> {{member of}} the Wounded Warrior Project, which rehabilitates wounded American war veterans, threw the {{ceremonial}} coin. Georgia Tech won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball to begin the game. After Georgia Tech made its selection, Wake Forest elected to defend the north end zone to begin the game, forcing Georgia Tech's kickers to kick into the wind during the first and fourth quarters.|$|E
5|$|Ritchie Valens, {{who once}} had a fear of flying, asked Tommy Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> coin to decide. Bob Hale, a DJ with KRIB-AM, was working the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians {{departed}} for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.|$|E
5|$|On October 26 at AT Park, in a 5-0 {{win over}} the Royals in Game 5 of the World Series, Bumgarner pitched his second career postseason complete-game shutout, another four-hit shutout on the 2014 postseason, {{becoming}} the second pitcher in franchise history with two shutouts in a single postseason after Christy Mathewson's three shutouts in the 1905 World Series and the first San Francisco Giants pitcher to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> complete-game shutout in a World Series game since Jack Sanford in Game 2 of the 1962 World Series, according to Fox. In addition, according to Fox Sports, Bumgarner is the fourth left-handed pitcher {{with at least two}} shutouts in a single postseason, joining Whitey Ford, Sandy Koufax, and former teammate Randy Johnson. He set all-time MLB records for lowest World Series ERA (0.29) among pitchers of at least twenty-five innings pitched and three starts, and was the first pitcher in World Series history to pitch a shutout with at least eight strikeouts and no walks.|$|E

25|$|Test cricket {{is played}} in innings (the word denotes both the {{singular}} and the plural). In each innings, one team bats {{and the other}} bowls (or fields). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> coin; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} did {{not bring}} about the desired success; for instance, on occasions when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. Rarely would anyone be sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two main responses in dealing with a tunnel opening were to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open, or to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> few grenades down the hole and “crimp” off the opening. This approach proved ineffective due {{to the design of}} the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, Eliyahu {{teamed up}} with Shabtai Yudelevitz to conduct Jewish outreach. In 1950–1951, Mordechai was among the leaders of Brit HaKanaim (Hebrew: בְּרִית הַקַנַאִים, lit. Covenant of the Zealots), a radical {{religious}} Jewish underground organization which operated against the widespread trend of secularization in the country. They torched cars of people who drove on Shabbat, and butcher shops where non-kosher meat was sold. They once plotted to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> smoke bomb into the Knesset during a debate on drafting Orthodox women into the IDF. A {{member of the group}} was in the audience during the debate with the smoke bomb in his pocket, but lacked the opportunity to activate it.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for first season of the anime adaptation, the production crew led by director Jun'ichi Satō made a trip to Venice for location research. As a result of filming the movements of gondoliers sculling, they had to redraw the animation of undines rowing in the first episodes to make it realistic. Satō said that seeing a gondolier use his paddle to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> bottle {{out of the water}} inspired the scene in episode 11 of Aria the Animation where Alicia does the same with a ball, which was not in the manga. As part of the production company's commitment to adapting the manga faithfully and gesture of consideration toward the voice actors, they provided the collected volumes of Aqua and Aria to date, rather than requiring them to purchase their own or giving stacks of photocopies.|$|E

25|$|Before a match begins, {{the team}} captains (who are also players) <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> coin {{to decide which}} team will bat first and so take the first innings. Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match. In each innings, one team bats, {{attempting}} to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only {{two members of the}} batting team are on the field at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.|$|E
25|$|While Henry sulks at the Bethesda {{fountain}} with Violet, Gold takes Regina to {{find someone}} who he claims still has magic. Emma reminds Henry of their time in New York, telling him that he can still wish away his problems and <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> coin into the fountain; she reflects on the irony of her own words as she had wished to fill the void she felt in their family, which lead to Hook showing up with the memory potion. Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting her dark side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the story, {{the main}} {{character}} Miranda is often reading Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Stead's favorite book as a child; she read and reread it multiple times. She recalls that L'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood. Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda; she included {{it in the first}} draft and planned to remove it, [...] "because you can't just <b>toss</b> <b>A</b> Wrinkle in Time in there casually". Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story. Stead was aware that she did not want A Wrinkle in Time to have too big an influence on When You Reach Me. Keeping this in mind, she reread A Wrinkle in Time through the perspective of different characters, which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work.|$|E

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|PT-32, {{which had}} only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what {{appeared}} to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it. He ordered his crew to man the [...]50-caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes. Akin prepared to <b>toss</b> <b>a</b> barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look though the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but PT-41, carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove.|$|E
