40|$|Based on an {{extensive}} survey of woodland visitors in Wallonia, south Belgium, we examined a widerange of individual-, residential- and destination-level variables for their associations with the distancetravelled for woodland leisure on foot, by bicycle and by car. For each transport mode, explanatorybivariate {{analyses were conducted}} firstly to identify potential correlates of the distances travelled. Then,cross-classified multilevel analysis was performed to build estimation models for the <b>trip</b> <b>distance.</b> Theresults showed that, amongst the multilevel variables selected, walking <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> was only associatedwith individual trip behaviour, while cycling and car-borne <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> could also be associated withindividual socio-economic profile {{as well as a}} large range of residential and destination attributes onland use, land cover and visitor support services. The final estimation model for (i) walking trip distanceincluded trip duration as the only explanatory variable, for (ii) cycling <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> included variables ontrip duration, proportion of woodland area at residence and presence of service facilities at destination,and for (iii) car-borne <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> included variables on trip duration, visitor’s employment status,whether the trip is on weekend or in summer, proportion of woodland area at residence and remotenessof destination from urban area. Despite being simple in form, all multilevel estimation models showa satisfactory explanatory power and a better performance than the ordinary single-level models. Ourresults add new empirical evidences on the key factors associated with the transport mode-specific traveldistance, in particular, for woodland leisure. The cross-classified multilevel analysis used in our studyprovides new methodological insights for the estimation of individual <b>trip</b> <b>distance,</b> which could benefitfuture modelling of woodland recreation demand.

Denpasar City has experienced high increase in private vehicles use and long <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> to reach activity locations. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the accessibility of residents to several activities location in Denpasar City. The activities considered in this study included shopping centers, schools and health facility. Accessibility values were calculated based on Hansen’s Index. This study found that the activities in Denpasar City were not evenly distributed. Several zones mainly located in the center of the city had high accessibility values whilst zones located in the north of Denpasar City had low accessibility values. This has caused long average <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> travelled by resident of Denpasar City to reach location of activities.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} the {{development}} of procedures for the estimation of intrazonal <b>trip</b> <b>distances</b> based on data of origin-destination (O/D) surveys. In the application discussed here, the analysis {{was based on an}} O/D survey conducted in the city of São Carlos, Brazil. The urban area was subdivided several times so as to produce 471 traffic analysis zones (TAZ). The geometrical characteristics of the zones that might influence the <b>distances</b> of intrazonal <b>trips</b> were identified. Numerical indicators of the selected geometrical patterns were compared with the average values of intrazonal <b>trip</b> <b>distances</b> to search for evidences of correlation between these variables. Two analytical approaches were explored: i) continuous and ii) discontinuous. In the first case, all trips were considered a single dataset, whereas in the second the dataset was split into two subsets of homogeneous characteristics. The datasets with higher correlation were used to build global and individual models for the estimation of intrazonal <b>trip</b> <b>distances.</b> In the global models, walking, cycling, and auto trips were considered part of a common dataset. The three transport modes were separately taken into account in the stratified models. The values obtained with these models were then compared with the estimations of other models found in the literature. The discontinuous models calibrated in this study clearly outperformed the traditional ones, which may be an indication they can be used to replace the traditional models for the estimation of average intrazonal <b>trip</b> <b>distances,</b> at least in Brazilian medium-sized cities...|$|R

30|$|More specifically, {{we assume}} that the number of trips each vehicle makes daily has a normal {{distribution}} with a mean of 4 and a variance of 1.33 [27]. Once we simulate the number of trips each vehicles makes daily, we determine the <b>distances</b> of each <b>trip.</b> If the vehicle makes a single <b>trip,</b> the <b>trip</b> <b>distance</b> is randomly generated from a Weibull distribution with a mean of 36.12  miles (we use Imperial units for distances, because they are still the standard unit of measure used in the United States) and a variance of 12.04 [26]. If the vehicle makes two daily <b>trips,</b> the <b>distance</b> of each <b>trip</b> is half of the distance generated from the Weibull distribution (i.e., {{we assume that}} the vehicle is used for commuting to and from a workplace). If the vehicle makes three or more trips daily, two of them (which represent commuting <b>trips)</b> have <b>distances</b> that are one third of the Weibull-distributed <b>distance.</b> The remaining <b>trip</b> <b>distances</b> are randomly generated using a truncated non-negative Gaussian distribution. The mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution are determined so that in aggregate, one third of the vehicle miles driven are for commuting to and from the workplace [27]. The starting and ending times of each vehicle trip are determined based on the relative weights of vehicles reported to be driving at different times of day [27].|$|R

40|$|Seabird {{tracking}} {{has become}} an ever more popular tool to aid environmental procedures such as the designation of marine protected areas and environmental impact assessments. However, samples used are usually small and little consideration is given to experimental design and sampling protocol. European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis were tracked using GPS technology over three breeding seasons and the following foraging trip characteristics: <b>trip</b> duration, <b>trip</b> <b>distance,</b> maximum distance travelled from the colony, size of area used and direction travelled from colony were determined for each foraging trip. The effect of sex, year of study, breeding site, number and age of chicks and the timing of tracking on foraging behaviour were investigated using a General Estimation Equation model. A range of sampling scenarios reflecting likely field sampling were also tested to compare how foraging behaviour differed depending on composition of the sample of birds tracked. <b>Trip</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>trip</b> duration, maximum <b>distance</b> travelled and size of area used were all significantly affected by the breeding site, {{and the number of}} chicks a tracked adult was raising. The effect of sex was also seen when examining <b>trip</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>trip</b> duration and the maximum distance travelled. The direction travelled on a foraging trip was also significantly affected by breeding site. This study highlights the importance of sampling regime and the influence that year, sex, age, number of chicks and breeding site can have on the foraging trip characteristics for this coastal feeding seabird. Given the logistical and financial constraints in tracking large numbers of individuals, this study identifies the need for researchers to consider the composition of their study sample to ensure any identified foraging areas are as representative as possible of the whole colony 2 ̆ 7 s foraging area...|$|R
