500|$|On September 23, in a MSNBC {{interview}} with Kasie Hunt, Gary Johnson noted {{the benefits of}} being invited to the 2016 Presidential Debates. While discussing this topic, Johnson stuck out his tongue <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> at the reporter while explaining that he could win a three-way debate, and ultimately the Presidency, versus Clinton and Trump while speaking in that manner. Johnson's spokesperson, John LaBeaume, later stated, [...] "He was just having fun" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "lighthearted".|$|E
500|$|According to the CBS {{press release}} for Rawhide, the Universal (known then as Universal-International) film company was {{shooting}} in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and {{invited him to}} meet the director. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" [...] (193cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, [...] "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or {{which way to go}} or do anything". [...] Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> a lifelong trademark.|$|E

The production was revived in February 2015.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vanborough whispered {{fiercely}} to <b>his</b> wife <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clenched <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jonathan made {{no answer}} to this; but his breath {{literally}} hissed <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clenched <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Nostromo {{had listened}} with {{profound}} attention. [...] "You {{have made up}} your mind, then, to a speedy death," [...] he muttered <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clenched <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Jones had a {{handsome}} and strange voice. His singing was always partly about {{the appeal of}} the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang {{from the back of his}} throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|... hen {{you speak}} of us Republicans, you do so only to {{denounce}} us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to [...] "Black Republicans." ....But you will not abide {{the election of a}} Republican president! [...] In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! [...] That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> [...] "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!" ...|$|E
60|$|His lordship swore <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{and went}} downstairs heavily.|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{son of a}} confounded millionaire soap-boiler,” commented Mr. Blunt <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clenched <b>teeth.</b> “A man {{absolutely}} without parentage. Without {{a single}} relation in the world. Just a freak.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{knowledge}} that Mary's heart would bleed with sorrow {{if she knew}} of his condition nerved him to make another desperate trial. [...] "I'll try again to-morrow," [...] he said <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{said the}} latter words <b>through</b> <b>his</b> shut <b>teeth.</b> For {{a space of}} perhaps {{a couple of minutes}} there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned the}} horses {{suddenly}} to the left, speaking <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{man nodded}} in silence. Mr. Caryll swore <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Sir Richard rose.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{a breath}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> He could {{scarcely}} trust himself {{to speak for}} anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{probably}} {{break the}} wires or smash the machine, but I'll risk that," [...] muttered Benjy <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth.</b> [...] "I only hope you won't chew it, because dynamite mayn't be palatable. There--down with it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Wilson rose also. He {{was not a}} large man, {{but he was a}} very {{resolute}} one. [...] "I shan't go!" [...] he said, <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clinched <b>teeth.</b> Each man {{understood the}} tones of the other perfectly.|$|R
6000|$|... "By God, but you shall, if I so will it!" [...] snarled Francesco <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth.</b> Then turning <b>his</b> {{head in a}} {{fever of}} impatience [...] "Peppe," [...] he shouted, [...] "will you never bring that sword?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Green {{stood still}} {{to watch him}} go. Then he swore <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> and beckoned one of those whose {{acquaintance}} he had disclaimed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye've got it, ye have, but ye shan't ait it," [...] growled Briant <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> as he sprang {{over the}} seat towards the monkey.|$|E
60|$|He said it <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> {{with such}} a {{concentration}} of rage in his tones that {{it was easy to}} guess where the sore rankled.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Heaven, I will {{cast him}} {{down at her}} feet!" [...] he muttered <b>through</b> <b>his</b> closed <b>teeth.</b> [...] "There shall be no form nor {{likeness}} of man left in him. Then let him rise up, if he is able, and defend her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Coward, lache, poltroon, runaway!" [...] {{he hissed}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> clenched <b>teeth,</b> {{and was about}} to make a thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal, when the Princess Jaqueline, in her shape as a wasp, stung him {{fiercely}} on the wrist.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{with a sort}} of moan <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth,</b> he {{approached}} the bed and threw the sheet over the figure, holding it as in a sling; then, by a mighty effort, he swung it stiffly off the bed into the box.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you be silent!" [...] {{he hissed}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> his face deadly pale {{now with a}} passion of wrath at least as fierce as hers.|$|E
60|$|The {{last words}} came <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> like the growl of a dog. Mrs. Pendyce made the {{crouching}} movement {{of one who}} gathers herself to spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{give you}} a last chance," [...] the latter grated <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> [...] "Turn over that light-stick an' come along peaceable, or I'll lay you out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stacy {{had only}} groaned <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth.</b> [...] "Nothing," [...] he said briefly, [...] "except that I'm coming, as I said before, to dine with you to-night; {{but no more}} BUSINESS. I've enough of that with others, {{and there are some}} waiting for me in the outer office now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, all o' ye!" [...] he snarled <b>through</b> <b>his</b> set <b>teeth,</b> {{facing them}} all. As he stood thus {{the absurdity of}} his own {{attitude}} came upon him. They were only children, after all. Reeking with the sweat of shame and anger which burst from his burning skin, he reached for a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no mistake," [...] {{at length}} he muttered <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{compressed}} <b>teeth.</b> [...] "It {{is from the}} pouch of that accursed trapper. Like many of the hunters he has a mark in his mould, in order to know the work his rifle performs; and here you see it plainly--six little holes, laid crossways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you leave}} here, {{then at least}} I will come even with you, Macumazahn!" [...] {{threatened}} Cetewayo, spitting <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> as was his way when mad with passion.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{one more}} item to the account of that scoundrel Blood," [...] he said, <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> [...] "My God, what a {{reckoning}} there will be when we meet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{a gesture}} of wrathful contempt, Manuel flung the paper from him as he flashed {{a look at his}} companion, muttering <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> [...] "Traitor! Shall I kill him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A great flake of fire floated {{through the}} gloom, rocking {{to and fro}} like some vast bird upon its pinions. We had seen many such that night, torn by the gale from {{the crest of the}} blazing curtain as I have described. But--but--"Horace," [...] whispered Leo <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{chattering}} <b>teeth,</b> [...] "that flame is coming up against the wind!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Viper!" [...] said Denot, curling his lips, and {{speaking}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> closed <b>teeth.</b> [...] "Warmed in your bosom! I {{have yet to}} learn, old man, that I owe you ought; but if it be a comfort to you to know it, know that no worse evil awaits your daughter than to become {{the wife of a}} true Frenchman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brothers always! No, we {{were never}} brothers: we never, never can be brothers," [...] screamed the poor madman <b>through</b> <b>his</b> closed <b>teeth.</b> [...] "Oh! {{if we could have}} been brothers; if--if we could be brothers!" [...] and the long {{cherished}} idea, which, in his frenzy, he even yet had hardly quite abandoned, flashed across his brain, and softened his temper.|$|R
