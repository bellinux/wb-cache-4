5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand. Prior to {{the first day of}} ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand.

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|On July9, the Government of the Mariana Islands {{requested}} that President George W. Bush declare a major disaster {{area for the}} commonwealth. Governor Juan N. Babauta reported that the islands needed at least $2.5million to repair damages from the typhoon. The cost to repair infrastructure and clean up debris on Rota totaled $762,000. A helicopter carrying relief supplies {{was sent to the}} Pagan and Agrihan, where people had no food. The American Red Cross also provided $17,000 in assistance. The Government of Guam requested $6million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to repair the damages from Tingting. On July29, George Bush approved the request for a disaster declaration and federal aid began to be sent to the Mariana Islands and Guam. Almost a month later, the islands of Agrigan, Alamagan, and Pagan were granted public assistance. In mid-August, Typhoon Chaba caused significant damage in the Mariana Islands. A bill was passed following the storm to allow up to 500 people to be hired as <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> on Saipan and Tinian. In mid-September, a request was made by the commonwealth for $10million in natural disaster mitigation following the effects of successive typhoons in the region. The funds were to be used for cleanup efforts, aid residents struggling {{in the wake of the}} storms and help reduce unemployment.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> in the society has heightened the need to examine their effects on later occupations. In this paper, I explore {{to what extent the}} experience with training as a <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> affects is useful for later job. The Internet questionnaire was executed for 309 women of 20 years or older who worked as a <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> of the clerical work occupational category in different part of Japan. “The usefulness of an experience as a temporary worker” is determined to be some dependent variables by four fields (the person own situation, the work condition, the company’s attribute and <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> ’s level and attitude). I employ a cross-analysis and then a logistic regression analysis. My findings suggest “Age that began to work as a temporary worker” has a positive significant in the cross analysis and logistic regression analysis. And “Satisfaction rating (education and training). ” in the cross analysis and “Age group” in a logistic regression analysis are significant. As for the education and training as the <b>temporary</b> <b>worker,</b> it is suggested that there be a difference in the e ffect depending on the age. There findings suggest that employers need to consider the age of the <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> when hiring/ training the <b>temporary</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{reason for}} {{the large numbers of}} illegal {{immigrants}} present in the United States is the termination of the bracero program. This bi-national program between the U.S. and Mexico existed from 1942 to 1964 to supply qualified Mexican laborers as guest workers to harvest fruits and vegetables in the United States. During World War II, the program benefited the U.S. war effort by replacing citizens' labor in agriculture to serve as soldiers overseas. The program was designed to provide legal flows of qualified laborers to the U.S. Many Mexicans deemed unqualified for the program nonetheless immigrated illegally to the United States to work. In doing that they broke both U.S. and Mexican law. Many legal <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> became illegal when they chose to continue working in the U.S. after this program ended. The change in law was not accompanied by a change in economic incentives for Mexican workers and the American growers.|$|E
