5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> cyclonically and could be tracked for a further day or two within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The Maya at Chaktumal fed false {{information}} to the Spanish, and Montejo {{was unable to find}} d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> around the Yucatán Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.|$|E

5|$|When Cristiano Ronaldo was fouled on {{the right}} wing 40yards from goal in the 13th minute, Ryan Giggs was {{presented}} with the first chance of the match; although intended as a cross, Giggs' free-kick hit {{the outside of the}} post. Another foul on Ronaldo gave Giggs another chance to apply pressure with a crossed free-kick shortly after, but Ruud van Nistelrooy was only able <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> the ball over the goal with his head with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann beaten. Arsenal's attacking play lacked their usual ambition, with their best opportunity coming in the 75th minute, when a deft touch from Dennis Bergkamp almost played Patrick Vieira into the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|While near peak intensity, Typhoon Fengshen {{underwent}} the Fujiwhara {{effect with}} Typhoon Fung-wong, causing the latter storm <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> to its south. Fengshen gradually weakened while approaching Japan, and it {{crossed over the}} country's Ōsumi Islands on July25 as a severe tropical storm. The typhoon washed a freighter ashore, killing four people and forcing the other 15crew members to be rescued. In the country, Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall that caused mudslides and left $4million (¥475million 2002JPY), in crop damage. There was an additional death in the country. After affecting Japan, Fengshen weakened in the Yellow Sea to a tropical depression, before moving across China's Shandong Peninsula and dissipating on July28.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition and placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships. The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off {{the east coast of}} Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north <b>to</b> <b>loop</b> around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest; the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.|$|E
