5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> <b>and</b> can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the power-up items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical {{experience}} point-driven character growth of most role-playing games, each characters' abilities is linked to their Psyphers, {{and the amount of}} damage characters can inflict depends upon the strength of their Psypher. These two elements are upgraded by collecting Phozons, spirit energy released from defeated enemies. Phozons fill a magic meter, which is used to trigger special skills. All physical attacks drain a character's POW (power) gauge, and if depleted entirely the character must rest until the gauge refills. Tied to Phozons and leveling is a farming system, where seeds planted and fueled with Phozons provide meals which raise a character's level, boosting <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> abilities. Food can be grown in the wild using seeds, but later two restaurants are available where prepared meals can be eaten. Various elements, such as food and material, can be used together using an Alchemy system which allows for the creation of potions with various effects, from dealing damage to healing the main character.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of that mission, {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready to swarm attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with raising <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> magic meters, and giving random boosts to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points on a map.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat which were imprisoned up to three months. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
