Or, in a city or spaceport, it could mean being accosted by suspicious Federal authorities or approached by a patron (or perhaps a very convincing con man). Alternatively, the Encounter Table might yield an Accident, i.e. a random event like a spacesuit leak, or the PC's Mobile Lab ATV encountering quicksand or their robot suddenly going berserk.

40|$|We {{study the}} pair {{production}} of scalar top-quark partners decaying to a top-quark pair plus large missing energy at the LHC, a signature which appears in numerous models that address outstanding {{problems at the}} TeV-scale. The severe experimental search cuts require a description which combines higher-order corrections to both production and decay dynamics for a realistic final state. We do this at next-to-leading order in QCD for the first time. We find large, kinematic-dependent QCD corrections that differ dramatically depending upon the observable under consideration, potentially impacting the search for and interpretation of these states.

40|$|The Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld (EiBI) {{model is}} reformulated within the mimetic approach. In the {{presence}} of a mimetic field, the model contains non-trivial vacuum solutions which could be free of spacetime singularity because of the Born-Infeld nature of the theory. We study a realistic primordial vacuum universe and prove the existence of regular solutions, such as primordial inflationary solutions of de Sitter type or bouncing solutions. Besides, the linear instabilities present in the EiBI model are found to be avoidable for some interesting bouncing solutions in which the physical metric as well as the auxiliary metric are regular at the background level.

40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to evaluate the}} distribution of the largest Schmidt eigenvalue for entangled random pure states of bipartite systems is proposed. We point out that the multiple integral defining the sought quantity for a bipartition of sizes N, M is formally identical (upon simple algebraic manipulations) to the one providing the probability density of Landauer conductance in open chaotic cavities supporting N and M electronic channels in the two leads. Known results about the latter can then be straightforwardly employed in the former problem for both systems with broken (β = 2) and preserved (β = 1) time reversal symmetry. The analytical results, yielding a continuous but not everywhere analytic distribution, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

40|$|We {{discuss some}} details {{regarding}} {{the method of}} smoothed residuals, which has recently been used to search for anisotropic signals in low-redshift distance measurements (Supernovae). In this short note we focus on some details regarding {{the implementation of the}} method, particularly the issue of effectively detecting signals in data that are inhomogeneously distributed on the sky. Using simulated data, we argue that the original method proposed in Colin et al. [1] will not detect spurious signals due to incomplete sky coverage, and that introducing additional Gaussian weighting to the statistic as in [2] can hinder its ability to detect a signal. Issues related to the width of the Gaussian smoothing are also discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, 1 <b>table,</b> <b>references</b> added, matches final version published in JCA...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{collider}} signatures of the left-right twin Higgs {{model in the}} case that the right-handed neutrino mass is less than the mass of the right-handed gauge boson. In this scenario, new leptonic decay chains open up, allowing the particles which cancel the one-loop quadratic divergences of the Higgs, the right-handed gauge bosons and top-partners, to be discovered. Half of these events contain same-sign leptons without missing energy, which have no genuine standard model background and for which the backgrounds are purely instrumental. These signals may be used to complement other collider searches, and in certain regions of parameter space, may {{be the only way to}} observe the particles responsible for natural electroweak symmetry breaking in the left-right twin Higgs model.

40|$|We {{suggest a}} thick braneworld {{model in the}} squared {{curvature}} gravity theory. Despite the appearance of higher order derivatives, the localization of gravity and various bulk matter fields is shown to be possible. The existence of the normalizable gravitational zero mode indicates that our four-dimensional gravity is reproduced. In order to localize the chiral fermions on the brane, two types of coupling between the fermions and the brane forming scalar is introduced. The first coupling leads us to a Schrödinger equation with a volcano potential, {{and the other a}} Pöschl-Teller potential. In both cases, the zero mode exists only for the left-hand fermions. Several massive KK states of the fermions can be trapped on the brane, either as resonant states or as bound states.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{modified}} Dirac equation {{in the framework}} of very special relativity (VSR). The low-energy regime is accessed and the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is obtained. It turns out that this Hamiltonian is similar to that achieved from the Standard Model Extension (SME) via coupling of the spinor field to a Lorentz-violating term, but new features arise inherited from the non-local character of the VSR. In addition, the implications of the VSR-modified Lorentz symmetry on the spectrum of a hydrogen atom are determined by calculating the first-order energy corrections in the context of standard quantum mechanics. Among the results, we highlight that the modified Hamiltonian provides non-vanishing corrections which lift the degeneracy of the energy levels and allow us to find an upper bound upon the VSR-parameter.
