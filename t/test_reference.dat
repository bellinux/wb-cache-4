40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are typically performed using the clinical diagnosis or amyloid-β {{positron emission tomography}} as the <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> However, neither {{can be considered a}} gold standard or a perfect <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> for AD.

Methods: To determine the diagnostic accuracy ofADbiomarkers and taking the imperfectness of the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> into account, we have developed a Bayesian method.

40|$|For {{an inner-city}} {{location}} in Kassel representative TRY (<b>test</b> <b>reference</b> year) data sets are compared with technical measurement results of long-term climatic data especially as regards their application for the simulation of a building's thermal performance. This research study {{was carried out}} {{on the basis of}} climate measurements which were recorded over the period from 1994 to 2003 by the climate station of the building physics department at the University of Kassel. Both the analysis of the mean temperature values and that of the excess-temperature degree hours show, that the <b>test</b> <b>reference</b> year in summer comprises considerably lower outside temperatures than the 10 -years average of the measurements. Not only the <b>test</b> <b>reference</b> standard year but also the data set of the German Meteorological Service for an extremely warm summer proved to be not representative. For winter, the standard year reflects the average measured conditions quite well. The outside temperature of the <b>test</b> <b>reference</b> year for a "cold winter", however, lies well below the values of the coldest measuring periods in January and February. The comparison of simulation results with various sets of climatic data shows that deviations in the sets of climatic data also lead to clear differences in the computed values of temperature conditions in summer and in the heating energy requirement. The decade from 1990 to 2003, as is known, is one of the warmest decades since the beginning of weather recording. Whether the deviations described are due to this or rather to the very different topography of the reference location by comparison with the measuring station cannot be clarified {{on the basis of this}} investigation, presumably there is an interaction of both influences. The research study quantitatively shows, however, the range of error which may result from the application of reference climatic data...|$|E

30|$|Besides the {{descriptive}} statistics (mean, variance, min–max values), hypothesis tests for the assumptions including normality and {{homogeneity of variance}} were performed using SPSS version 21. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was utilized to check whether the variables Cmax (<b>test</b> and <b>reference)</b> and AUC (<b>test</b> and <b>reference)</b> follow a normal distribution at 5  % level of significance. As {{a result of this}} test, neither Cmax nor AUC distributed normally (significance level =  0.05). Since the distribution of the AUC and Cmax tend to be skewed and their variances increase with the means, log transformation was used. Therefore the variances became independent of the mean and the distributions tend to be more symmetric (Rani and Pargal 2004). All analyses were done by using logarithmically transformed Cmax and AUC values. According to experimental design, each subject takes both <b>test</b> and <b>reference</b> drugs in different periods for all studies. In order to compare these two related groups (<b>test</b> or <b>reference)</b> for each variable (Cmax or AUC), dependent t test called paired sample t-test were conducted at 5  % level of significance.|$|R

40|$|Objective(s) : Diagnostic nuclear {{medicine}} is being increasingly employed in clinical {{practice with the}} advent of new technologies and radiopharmaceuticals. The report of the prevalence of a certain disease is important for assessing the quality of that article. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the quality of published {{nuclear medicine}} articles and determine the frequency of reporting the prevalence of studied diseases. Methods: We used Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS- 2) checklists for evaluating the quality of articles published in five nuclear medicine journals with the highest impact factors in 2012. The articles were retrieved from Scopus database and were selected and assessed independently by two nuclear medicine physicians. Decision concerning equivocal data was made by consensus between the reviewers. Results: The average STARD score was approximately 17 points, and the highest score was 17. 19 ± 2. 38 obtained by the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine. QUADAS- 2 tool showed that all journals had low bias regarding study population. The Journal of Nuclear Medicine had the highest score in terms of index <b>test,</b> <b>reference</b> standard, and time interval. Lack of clarity regarding the index <b>test,</b> <b>reference</b> standard, and time interval was frequently observed in all journals including Clinical Nuclear Medicine, in which 64 % of the studies were unclear regarding the index test. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology had the highest number of articles with appropriate reference standard (83. 3 %), though it had the lowest frequency of reporting disease prevalence (zero reports). All five journals had the same STARD score, while index <b>test,</b> <b>reference</b> standard, and time interval were very unclear according to QUADAS- 2 tool. Unfortunately, data were too limited to determine which journal had the lowest risk of bias. In fact, it is the author’s responsibility to provide details of research methodology so that the reader can assess the quality of research articles. Conclusion: Five nuclear medicine journals with the highest impact factor were comparable in terms of STARD score, although they all showed lack of clarity regarding index <b>test,</b> <b>reference</b> standard, and time interval, according to QUADAS- 2. The current data were too limited to determine the journal with the lowest bias.
