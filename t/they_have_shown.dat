5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E

25|$|Harold and Red {{spend much}} of their time on the show trading insults and poking fun at each other. While <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> they can {{cooperate}} with one another at times, Harold is often very critical of Red's ideas and schemes, but usually ends up going along with them anyway.|$|E

25|$|CNNs are {{suitable}} for processing visual and other two-dimensional data. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> superior results in both image and speech applications. They can be trained with standard backpropagation. CNNs are easier to train than other regular, deep, feed-forward neural networks and have many fewer parameters to estimate. Examples of applications in computer vision include DeepDream.|$|E
25|$|Private sector {{unions are}} {{regulated}} by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly by state laws. In general <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> robust growth rates, because wages and working conditions are set through negotiations with elected local and state officials. The unions' political power thus comes into play, {{and of course the}} local government cannot threaten to move elsewhere, nor is there any threat from foreign competition.|$|E
500|$|On 11 September, {{after the}} {{international}} matches Benfica {{returned with a}} home match against Moreirense. Petit opened {{the game with a}} free kick, while Simão set the final score in the 83rd minute. The following Thursday, Benfica played {{the first round of the}} UEFA Cup against Slovak team Banská Bystrica. Benfica dominated the match, winning 3–0 with a double from Simão and one from João Pereira. On 19 September, Benfica travelled to Coimbra to face Académica, beating them 1–0 with a goal from Simão to reach the top of the league table. Trapattoni praised his team and said leading is important to their mentality: [...] "I am happy with the win, but also with the character <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown.</b> I had the opportunity to lead in Italy and Germany and it is very important. The team starts to believe in themselves more and more." [...] A week later, Benfica hosted Braga. Despite playing with two players upfront, Benfica was unable to score, splitting points with them. After the game, Trapattoni acknowledged the difficult game his team had played, saying, [...] "The final score could disappoint the fans, but let's not forget we are still leaders. Our opponent was a very dangerous team. We had three good chances in the first half, but could not score." [...] On 30 September, Benfica closed the month by hosting Banská Bystrica. Benfica wasted opportunities to build up their score, only beating the Slovaks by 2–0.|$|E

2500|$|Bacteriocins {{have also}} been {{suggested}} as a cancer treatment. [...] <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> distinct promise as a diagnostic agent for some cancers, but their status {{as a form of}} therapy remains experimental and outside the mainstream of cancer research. This is partly due to questions about their mechanism of action and the presumption that anti-bacterial agents have no obvious connection to killing mammalian tumor cells. [...] Some of these questions have been addressed, at least in part.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain had}} risen and was walking {{the floor of}} his tent, visibly excited.

2500|$|... α7 receptors are homomeric {{neuronal}} acetylcholine receptors {{consisting of}} five α7 subunits and has five ACh binding sites. [...] Abnormality in the α7 receptors expression {{have been reported}} to influence progression of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. [...] The α7 are not believed to have as much affinity for nicotine as the heteromeric receptor but instead <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> more affinity for alpha bungarotoxin which is a nicotinic antagonist found in venom of some snakes. [...] Targeting of α7 receptors is therefore thought to be useful in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|It is a soliton, in {{the sense}} that it propagates without {{changing}} its shape, but it is not made by a normal pulse; rather, it is a lack of energy in a continuous time beam. The intensity is constant, but for a short time during which it jumps to zero and back again, thus generating a [...] "dark pulse"'. Those solitons can actually be generated introducing short dark pulses in much longer standard pulses. Dark solitons are more difficult to handle than standard solitons, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> to be more stable and robust to losses.|$|E
2500|$|Dirk Frans, {{executive}} director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a [...] "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: [...] "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." ...|$|E

2500|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation [...] temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its full {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research field. Different nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however, no evidence shows vitamins or food additives improve symptoms.

Fava and velvet beans are natural sources of L-DOPA and are taken by many people with PD. While <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> some effectiveness, their intake is not free of risks. Life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Faecal transplants may have a beneficial impact on symptoms.|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey is {{kicked out}} of the flat by Cheryl who does not believe her claims. It was {{revealed}} Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) would become an unlikely ally for Lynsey. Cooper explained that Lynsey supported Jacqui through her rape trial and believed Jacqui was telling the truth. This means Jacqui can relate to Lynsey's situation with Silas as nobody believes Lynsey's claims, leading to them building [...] "a great friendship". Hassan also commented on the friendship, saying she was surprised to hear the pair would become friends as naturally they would not be expected to be friends. She elaborated on this, saying the characters are at opposite [...] "ends of the spectrum" [...] but have both been through traumatic times and have had people not believe them. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> each other kindness so there is [...] "a real tenderness in their friendship".|$|E

As Blackbeard has said, some of them are too fond of killing themselves, and some are too fond of killing each other. I wish they would come here--the whole nation of them--and learn how to live in peace and be happy among the Eskimos. But they will not come. Only a few of their best men venture to come, and I should not wonder if their countrymen refused to believe the half of what they tell them when they get home." ...|$|R
