With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2.

Based on the <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> distribution of streamlines, velocities, and pressures in the draft tube, an optimal draft tube was found, which can increase the efficiency of this hydraulic turbine more than 1. 5 %. The <b>efficiency</b> of <b>turbine</b> with the optimal draft tube, draft tube with four pairs of middle-sized vortex generator, and draft tube without vortex generator under different heads of turbine (5 – 14 [*]m) was calculated, and it was verified that these two kinds of draft tubes can increase the <b>efficiency</b> of this <b>turbine</b> in every situation...|$|R

The scale rotors {{are based on the}} full-scale Department of Energy Reference Model 1, modified to reproduce the hydrodynamic performance of the full-scale turbine (20 m diameter) at the reduced experimental Reynolds number (10 ^ 5 vs 10 ^ 6, based on chord length). Flow incident on the turbines and in the wakes was characterized by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) measurements. Tip speed ratio (TSR) similarity of the turbines is achieved by controlling the torque applied by magnetic particle brakes. Single turbines were characterized over a range of mean freestream velocities to explore the effect of Reynolds number on turbine performance. Measured <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of approximately 40 % are similar to efficiencies predicted from full-scale simulations, indicating similar power extraction efficiency at scale.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is that it can}} often clean itself. As the water leaves the runner, leaves, grass etc. will not remain in the runner, preventing losses. Therefore, although the <b>turbine's</b> <b>efficiency</b> is somewhat lower, it is more reliable than other types.

Other turbine types are clogged more easily, and consequently face power losses despite higher nominal efficiencies.|$|R
40|$|Deterioration {{of engine}} {{components}} may cause off-normal engine operation. The {{result is an}} unecessary loss of performance, because the fixed schedules are designed to accommodate {{a wide range of}} engine health. These fixed control schedules may not be optimal for a deteriorated engine. This problem may be solved by including a measure of deterioration in determining the control variables. These engine deterioration parameters usually cannot be measured directly but can be estimated. A Kalman filter design is presented for estimating two performance parameters that account for engine deterioration: high and low pressure <b>turbine</b> delta <b>efficiencies.</b> The delta efficiency parameters model variations of the high and low pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from nominal values. The filter has a design condition of Mach 0. 90, 30, 000 ft altitude, and 47 deg power level angle (PLA).

It was found that known high pressure <b>turbine</b> delta <b>efficiencies</b> of - 2. 5 percent and low pressure <b>turbine</b> delta <b>efficiencies</b> of - 1. 0 percent can be estimated with an accuracy of + or - 0. 25 percent efficiency with a Kalman filter.

50|$|Power {{from such}} a system can be {{calculated}} by the equation P=Q*H/k, where Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, H is the static head, and k is a constant of 5,310 gal*ft/min*kW. For instance, for a system with a flow of 500 gallons per minute and a static head of 60 feet, the theoretical maximum power output is 5.65 kW. The system is prevented from 100% efficiency (from obtaining all 5.65 kW) due to the real world, such as: <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiency,</b> friction in pipe, and conversion from potential to kinetic energy. <b>Turbine</b> <b>efficiency</b> is generally between 50-80%, and pipe friction is accounted for using the Hazen-Williams equation.|$|E
50|$|One {{other factor}} {{negatively}} affecting the gas <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiency</b> is the ambient air temperature.

50|$|In addition, {{air with}} higher {{humidity}} is less dense, providing lower lift and lower propeller or <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiency</b> (this is somewhat offset by decreased drag).

50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a gas}} turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio, requiring higher-temperature compressor materials, and raising the turbine entry temperature, requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling. It is also increased by reducing the losses as the flow progresses from the intake to the propelling nozzle. These losses are quantified by compressor and <b>turbine</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and ducting pressure losses.
