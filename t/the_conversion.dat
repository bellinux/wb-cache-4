5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced <b>conversions</b> in <b>the</b> Crown of Aragon {{happened}} during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> forced by <b>the</b> rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine the validity of <b>the</b> <b>conversions.</b> <b>The</b> commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld <b>the</b> <b>conversions,</b> putting <b>the</b> forcibly converted subjects {{under the authority of}} the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> of forests in Northeast China during 1988 - 2005 by using a 1 -km area {{percentage}} data model (1 -km APDM) with remote sensing data and to find the spatiotemporal characteristics of land conversions between forests and other land uses/covers and internal conversions between forest cover types. Data were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) images of bands 3, 5, and 4 acquired in 1988, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Research results show that in the period between 1988 and 2005, the forest area in Northeast China underwent dramatic changes, and 4. 11 million ha of forest area was aggregately lost because of <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> of forests to other land uses/covers; at the same time, the forest area also gained 2. 00 million ha because of <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> from other land uses/covers to forests. The results also demonstrate the forest degradation resulting from <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> between different forest cover types. This research demonstrates the feasibility and importance of using the 1 -km APDM at a finer resolution to trace the spatiotemporal patterns of <b>the</b> forest <b>conversions.</b> </span...|$|R
5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> of non-Christians within their territories. He urged <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E

5|$|In a later period, the two central {{cells of}} the rear wall have been {{combined}} by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image. The old entrance was also widened during <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during <b>the</b> <b>conversion,</b> and still have doors. The hall also has traces of plaster and paintings, both added during <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> and renewed in later times - possibly {{as late as the}} 19th century. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like Devi, Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva. Some of the cells fitted with wooden doors were used for storage. Nine Sati memorials were added on the left wall during <b>the</b> <b>conversion,</b> each is {{in the shape of a}} long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. All of them are worn out, but one of them hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|The Nitta Maru-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to upgrade NYK's passenger service to Europe and {{it was reported that}} Nitta Maru was the first ship to be fully air conditioned in the passenger quarters. The IJN subsidized all three Nitta Maru-class ships for possible conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Kasuga Maru was the last ship of her class and was built by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. at their Nagasaki shipyard for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). She was laid down on 6 January 1940 as yard number 752 and launched on 19 September 1940. Sources are contradictory regarding when <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> occurred and if the ship was completed before <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> began. Jentschura, Jung and Mickel state that Kasuga Maru was towed to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for conversion on 1 May 1941., Stille, however, and Watts & Gordon say <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> began while the ship was under construction. This is indirectly supported by the allocation of a new yard number, 888, to the ship. Tully, on the other hand, says that she was requisitioned on 10 February 1941 and was used as a transport until <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> began on 1 May.|$|E

30|$|The H 2 /CO product ratio {{over all}} the three {{bimetallic}} carbide catalysts (as shown in Table  5) were above 1, which indicated the CH 4 decomposition (reaction  1) was favoured over the bimetallic catalysts. As mentioned in monometallic carbide catalyst discussion, the availability of ZrO 2 contributes to <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> of both CH 4 and CO 2, {{and on the other}} hand, it also improves the side reactions which can lead to the observed difference between <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> and <b>the</b> product yields. As exhibited in Table  5, <b>the</b> <b>conversions</b> of CH 4 and the yields of H 2 were arguably at the same level. This phenomenon indicated that the incorporation of Co into the Mo 2 C catalysts can significantly depress the Reverse Water Gas Shift (reaction (3)).|$|R
