5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the war, Göring was {{repeatedly}} ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> falling into enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, perhaps for {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E

5|$|The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association added a Chautauqua Day to {{the camp}} meeting in 1885, and it became highly popular. It {{occurred}} on the first Thursday of the meeting. A number of people, including Lyman Abbot, frequented the Chautauqua Days as a speaker. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> interfering with other camp meeting activities, the day {{was moved to the}} Tuesday before the official start of the meeting in 1886, but in 1889, it was moved to the first Wednesday.|$|E
5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria came of age to die simply <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked {{on a series of}} royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{numbering}} grid {{for the new}} Interstate Highway System {{was established}} as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being confused with one another, and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially collide with US50 and US60. Both highway systems still number the routes ending in odd numbers north–south and the even-numbered highways run east–west, although the Interstate System labels its main north–south highways with numbers ending in 5, rather than 1.|$|E

5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible {{for the survival of}} early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|When {{the initial}} request was refused, Ugartechea sent 100dragoons to {{retrieve}} the cannon. The soldiers neared Gonzales on September 29, but the colonists {{used a variety of}} excuses <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the town, while secretly sending messengers to request assistance from nearby communities. Within two days, up to 140 Texians gathered in Gonzales, all determined not to give up the cannon. On October 1, settlers voted to initiate a fight. Mexican soldiers opened fire as Texians approached their camp {{in the early hours of}} October 2. After several hours of desultory firing, the Mexican soldiers withdrew.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
5|$|Tomić {{belonged to}} the first class of six Serbian pilots trained in France in 1912. In August 1914, he participated in the first aerial dogfight of the war, when he {{exchanged}} gunfire with an Austro-Hungarian plane over western Serbia. In the winter of 1915, during the Serbian Army's retreat across Albania to the Greek island of Corfu, he evacuated General Petar Bojović from Scutari by plane, delivered mail by air and transported the Serbian Government's gold and hard currency reserves from Niš <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> falling into enemy hands. Following the occupation of Serbia by the Central Powers, Tomić went to France and flew over the Western Front, where he had one confirmed kill. He returned to the Balkans in late 1916, conducted combat missions over Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia and shot down one enemy plane. Tomić continued flying {{after the war and}} became head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force's pursuit squadron in Novi Sad. During World War II, he was captured by the Germans and detained as a prisoner of war. Tomić left Yugoslavia following the war and settled in the United States with his wife. He died in Chicago in 1962.|$|E
