We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} ground-state (zero-temperature) quantum phase <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> systems with variable Hamiltonian parameters and classical (temperature-driven) phase <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> standard thermodynamics. An analogy is found between (i) phase-transitional distributions of the ground-state related branch points of quantum Hamiltonians in the complex parameter plane and (ii) distributions of zeros of classical partition functions in complex temperatures.

David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the band structure of two- and three-dimensional hexagonal layered materials using Landau Level optical Hall effect spectroscopy investigations, employing graphene and graphite as model systems. We study inter-Landau-level <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> highly oriented pyrolytic graphite {{and a stack of}} multilayer graphene on C-face 6 H-SiC, using data from reflection-type optical Hall effect measurements in the mid-infrared spectral range at sample temperatures of T= 1. 5 K and magnetic fields up to B= 8 T. We describe a comprehensive dielectric polarizability model for inter-Landau-level transitions, which permits analysis of the optical Hall effect data. From their magnetic field dependence we identify sets of H- and K-point inter-Landau-level <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> graphite and sets of inter-Landau-level transition from decoupled graphene single, and coupled graphene bi-, tri-, and quad-layer for the multilayer graphene stack. For inter-Landau-level <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> decoupled graphene single-layers and H-point <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> graphite we observe polarization mode preserving behavior, requiring symmetric magneto-optical contributions to the corresponding dielectric tensors. Inter-Landau-level <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> coupled graphene layers as well as K-point <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> graphite exhibit polarization mode mixing behavior, requiring antisymmetric magneto-optical contributions to the corresponding dielectric tensors. From the circular-polarization-averaged inter-Landau-level transition energies and the energy splitting between right- and left-handed circular polarized inter-Landau-level transitions we determine the model parameters in the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure band structure approximation for two- and three-dimensional hexagonal layered materials, with graphene and graphite as examples...|$|R

5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> which they lose all resistivity to electric current, {{in a process}} known as superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder.

It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E

The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
