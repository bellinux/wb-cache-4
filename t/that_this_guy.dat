Robida {{attacked}} {{individuals in}} a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts with a handgun and a hatchet—a weapon {{featured in the}} logo of the group's record label, Psychopathic Records. Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about. If anyone knows anything at all about ICP, then you know that they have never, ever been down or will be down with any racist or bigotry bullshit".|$|E

It's for those who lost their lives, and it's a gift to those who {{are in the process of}} healing (...) and Gill was not worthy of being a Megadeth fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ian McKellen as Iorek Byrnison, a panserbjørn (armored bear) {{who becomes}} Lyra's friend and comrade. Nonso Anozie had {{recorded}} lines {{for the part}} of Iorek Byrnison, but was replaced by McKellen at a late stage as New Line wanted a bigger name in the role. New Line president of production Toby Emmerich claimed that he [...] "never thought Anozie sounded like Iorek" [...] and while he initially trusted director Weitz's casting decision, he [...] "never stopped thinking <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> didn't sound right." [...] The recasting was against Weitz's wishes, though he later said [...] "if you're going to have anyone recast in your movie, you're happy it's Ian McKellen." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the BBC’s Pat Murphy: “My {{understanding}} is that {{it came from the}} mid-sixties and a guy called Grahame Corling, who used to open the bowling for New South Wales and Australia … apparently the suggestion was <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> wife was [...] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [...] started singing When a Man Loves A Woman, the old Percy Sledge number.” ...|$|R
500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I {{just thought it was}} incredible <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could be done." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Woody Allen movie Small Time Crooks (2000), Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) says {{of one of}} her husband's dimwitted friends: [...] "All <b>that's</b> {{missing from}} <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is a piece of velvet and a pet mouse." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{what struck}} me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, {{guessing}} what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors that struck me immediately – <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> not only loves bowling, {{he also has a}} fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy. He was pretty clear at 18 itself.|$|E
2500|$|On February 17, El Khalifi {{went to the}} Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center to pray before {{embarking on}} a suicide mission. [...] Authorities say he was [...] "not a regular" [...] at that mosque or any other in the area. [...] The mosque's imam offered to provide {{authorities}} with surveillance footage, but was told it was not necessary. Later that day, El Khalifi was provided a disarmed suicide vest and MAC-10 by Yusaf and transported to downtown Washington. [...] He was arrested before he exited the parking building he had been dropped off in, as he walked alone toward the Capitol building. [...] After the arrest, authorities raided his west Alexandria residence and searched his property. [...] "There is no doubt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was committed," [...] commented a law enforcement officer.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 {{television}} interview, Cornell {{said about}} religion, [...] "I don't follow any particular one. … Ultimately I think I'm {{sort of a}} freethinker and kind of open. … So many bad things–as well as good things–have happened based on people just sort of blindly following religion that I kind of feel like I want {{to stay away from}} any type of specific denomination or any religion period. If {{for no other reason than}} just that. I don't want to be involved with anything or condone any school of thought that at some point and in some way causes the death of innocent people, or tragedies where initial fantastic ideas [...] distorted. Like the life, for example, of Jesus is well-documented. It's corroborated by different people, who had different backgrounds, and different levels of education. And they wrote about it. We know <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> existed, and we know pretty much what he said, and it's pretty simple. Everything from that point on in terms of wars and fighting over land and territories and religious things, none of that was even included in anything he said. His message was pretty simple, be really nice to each other and everything will be okay." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a radio interview, {{director}} Ryan Davies said: [...] "The idea {{we came up}} {{with was}} <b>that</b> of <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who's completely mental playing the piano until his fingers bleed and attacking random people on the street. There's a lot of blood and gore. The band wanted the video to be juxtaposed to the song, because there's no piano in the actual song." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{you look}} at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my {{intention}} that by looking at him, <b>that</b> you knew <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time. Albert Watson ...|$|R
500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just thought it was just incredible <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|R
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E

That kind of stuff ain't in my line, so I beats it out without crackin' the safe. That's all I know about it until I sees the papers, and then for a while I was afraid to say {{anything}} because this guy O'Donnell has it in for me, and I know enough about police methods to know that they could frame up a good case of murder against me. But after a while Miss Hudson finds me and puts it up to me straight <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> Torrance hasn't got no friends except me and her.|$|E

5000|$|According to Loveless: [...] "Hurt Me Bad ... {{actually}} Tony Brown {{was playing}} some stuff {{for me when}} {{we were looking for}} some songs for the fifth album for MCA. He played this one and he was telling me about Deborah Allen being a writer on it and her husband. We listened to it and it just hit me! The melody and just everything about it. I just loved the way she did the demo on it and just loved the way she sung the song. Even the idea of the song ... here's <b>this</b> person <b>that's</b> been hurt by one relationship... and now <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> out of her life [...]. she's found a better relationship! So I just fell in love with it! It {{was a lot of fun}} to do the video because of the fact that John Jorgenson made it a lot of fun, and John Millen, the director, made it a lot of fun to do too. We did it in New Orleans... spent three days there... just had a big ole' time shooting it there in the French Quarter" ...|$|R

Although [...] "it's tragic <b>that</b> <b>this</b> young <b>guy</b> killed himself," [...] he says, [...] "there's {{no way of knowing}} if salvia {{had anything to do with}} it. It would seem, given the apparent widespread use of salvia, that if these are side effects, they don't occur at very high prevalence. Otherwise, the ERs would be filled with people having bad salvia reactions." ...|$|R
