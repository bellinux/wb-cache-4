5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from <b>those</b> <b>documents,</b> despite their secret status.|$|E
5|$|Ralph wrote {{a sermon}} for {{the feast of}} the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, {{probably}} because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph's in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has been edited and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had <b>those</b> <b>documents</b> copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal {{is one of the first}} to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left.

The analyses further reveal significant educational differentials in U. S. mortality among both {{men and women in the}} early 1980 s.

25|$|The Missouri Synod's {{original}} constitution {{stated that}} one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice, while more recent changes to <b>those</b> <b>documents</b> also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity. The synod requires that hymns, songs, liturgies, and practices be in harmony with the Bible and Book of Concord. Worship in Missouri Synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical, utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal, and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano. The contents of LCMS hymnals from the past, such as The Lutheran Hymnal and Lutheran Worship, and those of its newest hymnal, Lutheran Service Book, highlight the synod's unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy. More traditional LCMS Lutherans point to the Lutheran Confessions in their defense of liturgical worship.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{birth date}} of the {{daughter}} of Władysław of Opole is unknown. The approximate year of birth was established {{on the basis of}} one of the two supplications addressed to the Pope, whose credibility are now called into question. In <b>those</b> <b>documents,</b> her brothers (considered by historians as the authors of the two complaints) requested an adjournment of their sister's wedding with Henry IV, since they felt that her age wasn't appropriate for a bride. Since the marriage's date was established between 1277 and 1280, she could be born about 1265. Her birth probably took place in Opole, the capital of her father's Duchy, or in Racibórz. By convention, among the offspring of Władysław of Opole and Euphemia of Greater Poland, she is placed as the fifth and last child, although she could be older than Przemysław of Racibórz. If her name was Constance, she probably was named after her cousin Constance, daughter of Przemysł I of Greater Poland.|$|E
