You have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

He believes he is at his best when he is playing a tough game, while staying responsible: [...] "You just want to be physical and play with a bit of an edge, but you don't want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> team down short-handed." [...] Growing up, Schenn patterned his play after fellow defencemen Chris Pronger and Rob Blake.|$|E

[...] After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription [...] "To Brandon, this is for you <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> crow in.

500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is something you have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people {{had the luxury of}} doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

500|$|Between January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50,000-word {{letter to}} Douglas. He {{was not allowed}} to send it, but was {{permitted}} to take it with him upon release. In reflective mode, Wilde coldly examines his career to date, how he had been a colourful agent provocateur in Victorian society, his art, like his paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His own estimation of himself was: one who [...] "stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age". It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and Wilde examines that particularly closely, repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity: he had not forgotten Douglas' remark, when he was ill, [...] "When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting." [...] Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him and took responsibility for his own fall, [...] "I am here for having tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> father in prison." [...] The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas, for his own sake as much as Douglas's. The second half of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes you just have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near {{as bad as the}} fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although a {{majority}} of mainstream critics derided it as an unintelligible mess, it won top prizes at that year's Venice Film Festival and earned Korine the respect of noted filmmakers such as Gus Van Sant, among others. Its stature has only grown in the ensuing years, gaining a cult classic status as a truly shocking and experimental film [...] "unlike anything you've seen in a while – maybe ever" [...] – and that [...] "if you're {{the kind of person}} who claims to be frustrated by the predictability of commercial filmmaking, [...] a rare opportunity <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> money where your mouth is." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify her answer, she {{proposed}} a shell game [...] to illustrate: [...] "You look away, and I put a pea under one of three shells.

As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing {{to allow us to}} revise the odds on the shell under your finger." [...] She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{carefully}} and attentively, {{it is possible}} to avoid conduit-metaphor expressions. For example, [...] "Did you get anything out of that article?"

[...] Eschewing obvious conduit-metaphor expressions when communication is the topic is difficult. [...] "Try to communicate more effectively" [...] differs in impact from [...] "You've got to learn how <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> thoughts into words."
