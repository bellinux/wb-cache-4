5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the <b>thrust</b> <b>vector</b> and the reaction control system. The <b>thrust</b> <b>vector</b> refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E

Pontryagin's maximum principle is used together with a two-point boundary value numerical algorithm to derive open-loop controls for various parameterized limits on <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> angles. Without <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> a high alpha fighter with initial conditions 0. 6 Mach number and 15, 000 feet requires 7. 0 seconds to pitch-up to 90 degrees. However, with 20 -degree angle <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> the pitch-up takes only 1. 5 seconds with a final Mach number of 0. 47. Also, the gain in altitude is less than 100 feet.

25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines in Quiet Power Mode, in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the nose wheel of the landing gear.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the static test facility of the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to evaluate the internal performance of a nonaxisymmetric convergent divergent nozzle designed to have simultaneous pitch and yaw <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> capability. This concept utilized divergent flap deflection for <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> in the pitch plane and flow-turning deflectors installed within the divergent flaps for yaw <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring.</b> Modifications consisting of reducing the sidewall length and deflecting the sidewall outboard were investigated as means to increase yaw-vectoring performance. This investigation studied the effects of multiaxis (pitch and yaw) <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> on nozzle internal performance characteristics. All tests were conducted with no external flow, and nozzle pressure ratio was varied from 2. 0 to approximately 13. 0. The results indicate that this nozzle concept can successfully generate multiaxis <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring.</b> Deflection of the divergent flaps produced resultant pitch vector angles that, although dependent on nozzle pressure ratio, were nearly equal to the geometric pitch vector angle. Losses in resultant thrust due to pitch vectoring were small or negligible. The yaw deflectors produced resultant yaw vector angles up to 21 degrees that were controllable by varying yaw deflector rotation. However, yaw deflector rotation resulted in significant losses in thrust ratios and, in some cases, nozzle discharge coefficient. Either of the sidewall modifications generally reduced these losses and increased maximum resultant yaw vector angle. During multiaxis (simultaneous pitch and yaw) <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> little or no cross coupling between the <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> processes was observed...|$|R
