5|$|The {{building}} does demonstrate {{elements of}} Classical Revival architecture {{but they are}} minimal and concentrated around <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance.</b> Below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> hood there are two stone pilasters and a stone lintel, as well as relief work adorning the pediment; leading to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> are seven concrete stairs. The entire entry facade is a gable-front, temple style design and on the library's east wing there are stone-capped modified buttresses. Each of these elements demonstrates the Classical Revival style.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} of the palace's many rooms to be {{completed}} was the main dining room, built from 1830 to 1834. The principal central wing of the mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837. Between 1841 and 1842, a billiard room was constructed adjoining the dining room. From 1838 through to 1844, the guest wing, the east wing, towers, the service wing, and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> were completed. The final wing built of the mansion was the library wing; this was under construction from 1842 to 1844. The remaining four years of building works were spent on the palace's interior decoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two toilets. This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{north of}} Regent Street is the BBC's headquarters, Broadcasting House, whose front {{entrance}} is in Langham Place. Several national radio stations are broadcast from this building. The site had formerly been a {{building on the}} gardens of Foley House designed by James Wyatt and called Wyatt's House. It was demolished in 1928 (with much of the fixtures ending up in the Victoria and Albert Museum) to construct Broadcasting House. Construction was challenging because the building had to be visually similar to other properties on Regent Street, yet also contain over twenty soundproofed studios. The exterior is built of Portland stone and above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> is a sculpture by Eric Gill.|$|E
5|$|Internally, however, it {{consisted}} of various spaces. On either side of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> in Corn Street were a coffeehouse and tavern, each of four storeys. Above and below the main entrance were rooms designed as strongrooms. In {{the centre of the}} Exchange was an open court, surrounded by a colonnade. At the back of the building was a two-storey range, consisting of an arcade on the ground floor and a long first-floor room. Facing All Saints Lane were two four-storey houses for business or trades persons, and on the frontage to Exchange Avenue were a further three houses. Below these various elements were cellars. Those below the five houses were each separate; the others were mostly interconnected.|$|E

5|$|On August 25, 1996 the City of Kingston proclaimed Molly Brant Commemoration Day. The Mohawk Nation - Bay of Quinte, the Corporation of the City of Kingston, the City of Kingston Historical Board, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada {{had agreed}} to commemorate her life with the {{creation}} of a bust representing Molly Brant, along with an historic monument at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> of Rideaucrest Home on Rideau Street in Kingston. John Boxtel was commissioned to make the bust. The memorial sculpture was unveiled at Rideaucrest on Molly Brant Commemoration Day. The commemoration began with a service at St. George's Cathedral, a traditional Mohawk tobacco burning and a wreath-laying ceremony at St. Paul's Anglican Church, and a reception at Rideaucrest. The sculpture of Molly Brant was unveiled in the eastern courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be a royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the palace burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> of the 1931 office building, on the {{southeast}} corner of the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name etched into the stone above the main entrance; the sign was supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design that emphasized its mass. The main entrance was behind an elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E

5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 2009, Griffin {{took part}} in the BBC's topical debate programme, Question Time, as a {{representative}} of the BNP. He appeared alongside Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was challenged by members of the studio audience, and questioned by host David Dimbleby on comments he had previously made on the Holocaust. He was also critical of Islam. His invitation followed the election of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and led to significant debate over the merits of the BBC's decision. The appearance sparked a protest outside the BBC Television Centre prior to the recording of the programme, in which an estimated 500 people picketed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> of the complex, many chanting anti-Nazi slogans and others trying to break into the building to stop the programme being filmed. Some got past the police and security, but were expelled. Six protesters were arrested, and three police officers were injured, one needing hospital treatment.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrance</b> opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 the Central Committee {{purchased}} another {{parcel of}} land near Knesset Aleph {{for the construction of}} Knesset Bet and the adjoining neighborhood of Batei Brodie. For this second Knesset neighborhood, completed in 1908, two-story row houses were constructed on three sides of a rectangular courtyard. Like Knesset Aleph, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrances</b> of <b>the</b> row houses faced each other. The courtyard, too, contained a water cistern.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>entrances</b> {{lead into}} a {{vestibule}} area, from which doorways lead into the nave, and a stairway {{leads to a}} now-closed gallery.

Window and other trim is modest, and the walls and cove ceiling are plastered.|$|R
