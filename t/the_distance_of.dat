5|$|The {{period of}} the orbit is {{accurately}} known at 5.539years, although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion. The period between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5.52years, while before the Great Eruption {{it may have been}} lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4years. The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9. This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6AU, similar to <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Mars from the Sun, to 30AU, similar to <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Neptune.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E
