50|$|They soon {{discovered}} that at threshold potential, the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane potential, the threshold potential's conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers {{to the fact that}} any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. <b>The</b> <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the threshold potential.|$|E

40|$|Wave packet {{propagation}} in {{the basis}} of interpolating scaling functions (ISF) is studied. The ISF are {{well known in the}} multiresolution analysis based on spline biorthogonal wavelets. The ISF form a cardinal basis set corresponding to an equidistantly spaced grid. They have compact support of the size determined by the underlying interpolating polynomial that is used to generate ISF. In this basis the potential energy matrix is diagonal and the kinetic energy matrix is sparse and, in the 1 D case, has a band-diagonal structure. An important feature of <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> matrix elements of a Hamiltonian are exactly computed by means of simple algebraic transformations efficiently implemented numerically. Therefore the number of grid points and the order of the underlying interpolating polynomial can easily be varied allowing one to approach the accuracy of pseudospectral methods in a regular manner, similar to high order finite difference methods. The results of numerical simulations of an H+H_ 2 collinear collision show that the ISF provide one with an accurate and efficient representation for use in the wave packet propagation method.

We decided to look at cultural {{differences between the groups}} and identify any challenges that must be overcome to achieve a closer, more interdisciplinary collaboration. The study is based on qualitative methodology in which we conducted group interviews with employees in the two planning groups and single interviews with leaders who are involved in the groups. The interviews were transcribed and categorized and formed the basis for our analysis. In addition, we have selected a set of relevant theories that we need when we discuss our findings. We have studied theories about culture, teams, feedback, meeting culture, communication and interdisciplinary. In the survey it became clear that everyone wants a closer cooperation and that they want to be better acquainted with each other on a personal and professional level. We see that there are cultural differences that create challenges to achieve this. The supervisors have an important role to achieve closer cooperation, but there is much to gain by increased level of interdisciplinary work. ...|$|E
40|$|In large canal {{irrigation}} project areas, {{integrated management}} of surface and groundwater resources can improve water use efficiencies and agricultural productivity and also control water logging. Such integrated management requires an estimation of {{spatial distribution of}} recharge and ground water flow in the underlying aquifer. Recharge occurs both as percolation losses from fields and seepage losses from the water distribution network. Percolation losses are influenced by weather, soil properties, land use, and canal water and groundwater use. Seepage losses depend on the conditions of flow in the water distribution system. In large irrigation project areas all the factors influencing the recharge of groundwater vary spatially. In this study, a geographical information systems (GIS) is used to map the spatial distribution of recharge which then serves as input to a regional groundwater flow model for simulating {{the behavior of the}} underlying aquifer. <b>The</b> <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the project area can be divided into a set of basic simulation units (BSUs) that are homogenous with respect to the conditions that influence the recharge processes. A daily field soil water balance model and a simple canal flow model are used to estimate the percolation and seepage losses, respectively. The combination of models and GIS can be used as an integrated decision support system to assess the groundwater resources an...|$|E
40|$|In a conversation, {{a speaker}} {{sometimes}} has {{to refer to}} an object that is not previously known to the hearer. This type of reference occurs frequently in dialogues where the speaker is giving directions to a particular place. To make a reference, the speaker attempts to build {{a description of the}} object that will allow the hearer to identify it when she later reaches it. This thesis presents a computational model of how an agent collaborates on reference in direction-giving dialogues. Viewing language as goal-oriented behaviour, we encode route descriptions, referring expressions, and discourse actions in the planning paradigm. This allows an agent to construct plans that achieve communicative goals by means of surface speech actions, and to infer plans and goals from these actions. <b>The</b> <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a referring expression plan is acceptable to an agent if she is con#dent that the plan is adequate as an executable identi#cation plan. By considering the salience of the features used in a referring expression plan, an agent can evaluate her con#dence in its adequacy. Driven by the implicit intention of making plans mutually acceptable, the conversants collaborate until the hearer is con#dent in the adequacy of the current referring expression plan. In doing so, the conversants use suggestion and elaboration discourse actions that operate on the current plan. While collaborating, an agent is in a mental state that includes the intention to achieve the goal of having the direction recipient understand the directions, the plan the agents are currently considering, and a focus of attention into the plan. This collaborative state governs the discourse by sanctioning both the adoption of goals, and the mutual acceptance of plans. Re#ecting the inherent symmetry in collaborative [...] ...|$|E

40|$|What is the {{rationale}} for benefit-cost analysis (BCA) ? The answer is critical for determining how BCA results should be interpreted, their implications for policy, and how BCA should be conducted. There {{are at least two}} possible bases for justifying BCA, positive and normative. <b>The</b> positive <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> BCA identifies policy changes that satisfy the Kaldor-Hicks compensation test, so that those who benefit could hypothetically compensate those who <b>are</b> harmed. <b>The</b> normative <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> BCA identifies social improvements, e. g., by approximating a utilitarian calculus or promoting more consistent decisions by protecting against cognitive error. When human behavior differs from <b>that</b> which <b>is</b> assumed in standard economic models, the justifications may conflict. Individuals whose behavior differs from the models may disprefer a change in circumstances that normative models predict they should prefer. The positive justification is consistent with respect for individual autonomy and provides clarity about methodological choices in the analysis but can require endorsing cognitive and behavioral errors that individuals would wish to avoid. The normative justification implies rejecting policies that the population prefers and requires determining what preferences are normatively acceptable...|$|R

Pursuant to Article V(1) (e) of the New York Convention, the enforcement court may refuse to enforce an award {{which has been}} set aside in 2 ̆ 2 the country in which, or under the law of which, <b>that</b> award <b>was</b> made. 2 ̆ 2 Yet some enforcement courts have allowed enforcement notwithstanding such annulment, primarily on two bases. <b>The</b> first <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Article V(1) (e) is a discretionary ground for non-enforcement. <b>The</b> second <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Article VII(1) of the New York Convention allows enforcement {{through the application of}} the more favourable law. This paper examines the judicial disparities in determining the enforceability of foreign annulled awards, and explores the reasons for such disparities.

We developed an indirect approach to mapping the organic content of coastal sediments from hydro-acoustic reﬂectance data. <b>The</b> <b>basis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> both organic matter and acoustic reﬂectance are related to sediment type and grain size composition. Hence there is a collateral relationship between organic matter content and reﬂectance properties which can be exploited to enable high resolution mapping. We surveyed an area of seabed off the east coast of Scotland using a vessel mounted single beam echosounder with RoxAnn signal processing. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phytoplankton pigment contents were then measured in material from grab and core samples collected at intervals over a year. Relationships between the organic components and hydroacoustic characteristics were derived by general additive models, and used to construct high resolution maps from the acoustic survey data.
