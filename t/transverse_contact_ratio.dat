40|$|In {{the field}} of {{transmission}} and power transformation from the power engine to the working machine, gear pairs, are mostly used in mechanical engineering due to the ir compactness of the structure, high reliability and capacity. One way of improving the performance characteristics of gear pairs, and thus the gear transmitters, {{is to increase the}} number of simultaneously meshed pairs of teeth, or increasing the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> To this end, this paper analyzes in detail the partial and simultaneous influence of the number of teeth and tooth profile shapes, moving through shifting coefficient and pressure angle, to the number of simultaneously meshed pairs of teeth. The obtained results allow us to define the optim um parameters of cylindrical gear pairs, in terms of the size of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> Introduction The k inematic indicator of the existence of the transmitting continuity of a rotary movement is the total contact ratio. In order to achieve the transmitting continuity of a rotary movement, the total contact ratio must be higher than one. Based on the total contact ratio, the information on the number of simultaneously meshed pairs of the teeth which rotate during the contact period is obtained. For example, if the  – one and two pairs of teeth alternately take turn, and if the  – two and three pairs of teeth alternately take turn, etc. It should be noted that the  is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving multiple meshes. The next condition to meet is the compatibility between the accuracy of teeth production, the teeth rigidity and the intensity of the total load of the teeth pair. The influence of the addendum coefficient on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is shown in the paper (Li, 2008). It is shown that changes in the addendum coefficient in conjunction with the corresponding values of the shifting coefficient and gear ratio can achieve the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> value higher than four. The paper (Imrek, 2009) showed that the appropriate structural solution of the form of the teeth of spur gears can achieve a double mesh of the teeth at all points of the lenght of the line of action, when the value of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is less than two. The mathematical model of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section presents a mathematical model (equations from 1 to 4) and the algorithm (Fig. 1) to determine the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> The effect of the pressure angle and the number of teeth on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section analyzes the effect of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> using equation 4. Fig s. 2, 3 and 4 show the effect of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficient and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from. The analysis shows that the influence of the number of the teeth on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is much more pronounced at smaller values of the pressure angle. It can be concluded that the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> increases with the number of teeth and with a reduction in the pressure angle. The g radient of enhancement of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is more expressed at lower values of the gear ratio and at lower pressure angles. The effect of the pressure angle, the number of teeth and the shifting coefficient on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section analyzes the effect of the pressure angle, the number of teeth meshed and the shifting coefficient on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> using equation 3. Shifting coefficients This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 5, 6 and 7). The influence of the number of the teeth on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is significantly higher when the shifting coefficients are higher than zero, but at the same time the value of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is l ower. Shifting coefficients and This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 8, 9 and 10). When the shifting coefficients of the pinion are positive and the shifting coefficients of the gear are negative, the influence of the number of the teeth on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is lower than in the case when both shifting coefficients are positive. At the same time, the interval number of the teeth of the pinion is increased, when the triple mesh is achieved. Also, the value of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is increased. Shifting coefficients and This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are  and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 11, 12 and 13). When the shifting coefficient s of the pinion are negative and the shifting coefficients of the gear are positive, the influence of the number of the teeth on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is much lower compared to the case when both coefficients are positive or when the shifting coefficient of the pinion is positive, a the gear's one is negative. At the same time, the interval number of the teeth of the pinion is increased, when the triple mesh is achieved. In this case, the highest values of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> were obtained.   The interval of the pressure angle was increased when the triple mesh of the teeth is achieved. The change of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> by changing the addendum coefficient T he paper (Li, 2008) analyzed the impact of the addendum coefficient () on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> of the cylindrical gear pair. The analysis was conducted for two gear pairs, when the gear ratio  and, and when the shifting coefficients. What was shown in both variants is that the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> increases with the growth of the addendum coefficient. To perceive the simultaneous influence of the addendum coefficient and the shape of teeth profiles on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio,</b> the shifting coefficient was changed in the paper, and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Conclusion Higher values of the number of teeth meshed gears and higher values of the gear ratio correspond to higher values of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> In contrast, the lower values of the pressure angle correspond to higher values of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> Thereby, the gradient of the influence of the number of teeth and the pressure angle on the  <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on the value of the shifting coefficient. This gradient has the highest value when the shifting coefficients of the pinion and the gear are negative. The n egative values of the shifting coefficient of the pinion and the positive values of the shifting coefficient of the gear cause the smallest gradient influence of the number of teeth and the pressure angle on the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> At the same time, the combination of shifting coefficients cause s the highest value of the  <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> The a nalysis has shown that by varying the number of teeth of the gear pair, the pressure angle and the shifting coefficient, the value of the <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> higher than three cannot be accomplished. This means that during the contact period only a double and triple mesh of teeth can be achieved. For achieving the quadruple mesh of teeth, it is necessary to change the addendum coefficient.  </p...|$|E

In addition, relations of pump flow property {{and its influence}} factors are also inves-tigated. During that, only the pumps with <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratios</b> of not less than one are discussed. First, using the involute property, an analytic representation for flowrates is deduced, by which displacements and fluctuation coefficients of helical gear pumps can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Then, by incorporating several design considerations, optimization problems formaximum geometric displacement are formulated and solved integrally by an opti-mization code, Multifunctional Optimization System Tool, with which various types of design variables including real, integer, and discrete can be simultaneously dealt with. Finally, the desired pumps with optimal displacement can be obtained. The proposed approach facilitates the design optimization of helical gear pumps. Moreover, influences of design parameters on the displacement and flow characteristics of the optimal pumps by assigning individual param-eters are investigated. The result also concludes that the pump with a larger module, larger face width, or smaller tooth number has bigger displacement but may cause more severe flowrate fluctuation...|$|R

40|$|The {{demands the}} {{automotive}} gear designer has to considerduring the gear design process have changed. To design a gearthat will not fail {{is still a}} challenging task, but now lownoise is also a main objective. Both customers and legalregulations demand noise reduction of gears. Moreover, thequality of the product is more in focus than ever before. Inaddition, the gear design process itself must be inexpensiveand quick. One {{can say that the}} gear designer faces a newdesign environment. The objective of this thesis is tocontribute to the answer to some of the questions raised inthis new design environment. In order to respond to the new design situation, the geardesigner must consider new phenomena of gears that werepreviously not a matter of concern. One such phenomenon is anew gear failure type, Tooth Interior Fatigue Fracture (TIFF). As the gear teeth are made more slender in an attempt to reducethe stiffness variation during the mesh cycle, therebypotentially reducing the noise, the risk of TIFF is increased. The phenomenon of TIFF is explored in detail (paper III-VI) through fractographic analysis, numerical crack initiationanalysis using FEM, determination of residual stress by meansof neutron diffraction measurements, testing for determiningmaterial fatigue properties, fracture mechanical FE-analysis,sensitivity analysis and the development of an engineeringdesign method. The main findings of the analysis of TIFF arethat TIFF cracks initiate in the tooth interior, TIFF occursmainly in case hardened idlers, the fracture surface has acharacteristic plateau at approximately the mid-height of thetooth and the risk of TIFF is more pronounced in slender gearteeth. Along with the more optimised gear design, there is atendency for the gear to be less robust. Low robustness, i. e.,great variation in performance of the product, implies a highincidence of rejects, malfunction and/or bad-will, all of whichmay {{have a negative effect on}} company earnings. As the use ofoptimisation decreases the safety margins, greater attentionhas to be paid to guaranteeing the products' robustness. Moreover, in order to be cost-effective, the qualities of thegear must be verified early in the design process, implying anextended use of simulations. In this thesis, two robustnessanalyses are presented in which the analysing tool issimulation. The first one considers robust tooth root bendingfatigue strength as the gear is exposed to mounting errors, thesecond one considers robust noise characteristics of a gearexposed to manufacturing errors, varying torque and wear. Bothof these case studies address the problem of robustness ofgears and demonstrate how it can be estimated by use ofsimulations. The main result from the former robustnessanalysis is that wide gears are more sensitive to mountingerrors, while the latter analysis showed that to achieve robustnoise characteristics of a gear it should have large helixangles, and some profile- and lead crowning should beintroduced. The <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is a trade-off factorin the sense that both low average noise levels and low scatterin noise due to perturbations cannot be achieved.

40|$|In gearing {{smoothness}} in {{transmission of}} power depends {{mainly on the}} <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> <b>Contact</b> <b>ratio</b> determines the load shared by the teeth in mesh {{and it will be}} lower when the <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher. Therefore in high <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> gearing the load transfer from one tooth mesh to another takes place at a lower magnitude of load and the noise produced by this kind of a gearing will be lower. Profile modification in involute tooth gearing helps build properties to the gears in mesh that are uncommon to standard gears and further, it also helps in altering the tooth-sum of a gear pair operating between a specified centre distance and module.

The set of isomorphism classes of Legendrian knots modulo negative Legendrian stabilizations is in bijection with the set of transverse knots.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Theoretical {{calculation}} {{equation of}} meshing efficiency of globoidal indexing cam mechanism with steel ball is derived {{by analyzing the}} motion of steel ball and power loss of the mechanism. Based on the features of loads, meshing efficiency and influencing factors are analyzed. Calculation and analysis show that meshing efficiency varies with cam angle, friction coefficient and sliding velocity are major influencing factors, {{with the increase of}} them, meshing efficiency increase. Pretightening force, <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> factor and cam motion rule are minor influencing factors, meshing efficiency increases with the increase of pretightening force, the <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> factor affects meshing efficiency and the distribution of losing power, cam motion rule affects meshing efficiency by mean of it’s influence on inertia load of the mechanism, this research has guiding significance for design and manufacture of the mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} small Seifert fibered L–spaces {{in terms}} of taut foliations, transverse foliations and <b>transverse</b> <b>contact</b> structures. We give a sufficient condition for certain contact structures on small Seifert fibered 3 – manifolds with e 0 = − 1 to have nonzero contact Ozsváth–Szabó invariants. This yields an algorithm for deciding whether a given small Seifert fibered L–space carries a contact structure with nonvanishing contact Ozsváth– Szabó invariant. As an application, we prove the existence of tight contact structures on some 3 –manifolds obtained by integral surgery along a positive torus knot in the 3 –sphere...|$|R
