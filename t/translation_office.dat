5000|$|The <b>Translation</b> <b>Office</b> (Tercüme Odası, {{known in}} English as {{the office of}} the [...] "dragoman" [...] from the Turkish tercüme, [...] "translation") was set up in {{response}} to Greek independence. This was due to the fact that, prior to Greek independence, many Greeks had acted as translators in government business. Consequently, the Greek uprising for independence resulted in an exodus of the Greek translators working for the government and left a demand for translators. In addition, internal affairs including, the defeat of Ottoman armies at the hand of the Egyptians and the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi with the Russians, diplomacy became more important. Such developments not only led to growth within the <b>Translation</b> <b>office,</b> but also to higher scrutiny of the <b>Translation</b> <b>Office</b> and it increased salaries. [...] The job, however, didn’t just improve Ali Paha’s lot in life; it also impacted his future policies. For instance, Ali Pasha and others in the <b>Translation</b> <b>Office,</b> such as Ali Pasha’s future partner in reform, Mehmed Fuad Pasha, got needed experience in the world of diplomacy through the work of translation in that very field. This exposure to the diplomatic realm distanced Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha from the values of traditional Ottoman Society {{while at the same time}} developed within him the values of a rational bureaucrat.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1920s, Jamil {{moved to}} Jerusalem and set up a <b>translation</b> <b>office.</b> In 1932, Jamil {{established}} the Arab Organization for the Welfare of the Blind with his friend Sobhi Al Dajani. A AUB Graduate himself, Al Dajani and Jamil devoted themselves and their services to the blind cause. The organization was located on Jaffa Gate on the border between East and West Jerusalem on Jaffa Road. The aim of the organization was to enhance and improve the lives of the blind by providing manufacturing jobs to them. The workers made wooden brushes and brooms as well as cane wood stools in the factories. Most of the equipment was designed by Jamil Hashweh himself. Due to the 1948 war, they were forced to flee and leave all their assets behind. They restarted from the ground up again in 1950 as the Arab Blind Organization, on Via Dolorosa Street in Jerusalem, where Jamil was the Managing Director and Executive Board Secretary until 1964. During this period, Jamil expanded and established two more branches of the Arab Blind Organization. One was located in Hebron in the West Bank and the other in Amman, Jordan. Something worth mentioning is Jamil Hashweh took out personal loans, without collateral, to improve the Arab Organization for the Welfare of the Blind before 1948, and paid every cent back after 1950- this was unheard of in times of war.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} took particular {{prominence in}} the Ottoman Empire, where demand for the mediation provided by dragomans {{is said to have}} been created by the resistance on the part of the Muslim Ottomans to learn the languages of non-Muslim nations. The office incorporated diplomatic as well as linguistic duties—namely, in the Porte's relation with Christian countries—and some dragomans thus came to play crucial roles in Ottoman politics. The profession tended to be dominated by ethnic Greeks, including the first Ottoman Grand Dragoman Panagiotis Nikousios, the official interpreter for the Divan (Imperial Council) of the Sultan, and his successor Alexander Mavrocordatos. But this dominance changed in 1821 with the start of the Greek War of Independence; the last Greek grand dragoman, Stavraki Aristarchi, was charged with complicity with the rebels and executed. With unanswered correspondence accumulating, the chief naval instructor, one Ishak Efendi, took over the position and became a pioneer in translation of Western scientific literature into Turkish, a task for which he had to create an entirely new vocabulary. Following Ishak, the grand dragoman and his staff were Muslims, and the <b>Translation</b> <b>Office</b> (Tercüme Odası, [...] "Translation Room", in Turkish), with its familiarity with things European, became a new major ladder to influence and power in the Tanzimat era; this knowledge largely replaced the older ladders of the army, the bureaucracy, and the religious establishment in the mid- and late-19th century.|$|E

In 1840 he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs for a short time, before serving as ambassador to Great Britain in London (1841-44), and again Minister of Foreign Affairs under Koca Mustafa Reşid Pasha ( [...] Reshid Pasha [...] ) in 1846. In 1852 he was promoted to the post of Grand Vizier.He continued to represent the Ottoman Empire for {{most of the rest of}} his life, being Foreign Minister in 1857-8, July 1861 and November 1861 to 1867, and Grand Vizier in 1858-9, 1861 and 1867-71. A scholar and a linguist, he was a match for the diplomats of European powers, against whom he successfully defended the interests of his country. He was determined to steer Turkey into the 19th century, but he also was authoritarian and overbearing in his personal manner. He was a reformist politician and process of westernization took place in the Ottoman government in his period of prime ministry.
