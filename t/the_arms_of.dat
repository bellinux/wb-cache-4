5|$|The Canadian pale, a pale {{division}} {{amounting to}} half the entire field, derived from the Canadian flag, is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian fess, a similar horizontal division, has been used once. The term érablé, referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms. For example, as a tressure érablé in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Monarchist League of Canada, coronets érablé in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Sudbury and Canada's National History Society, and as a partition much like engrailed or dancetty.

5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes.

5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Canada. <b>The</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>of</b> Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E
