These vessels ranged in size between 400 and 1500 tons burthen (bm), carried up to 30 cannons and were capable in certain conditions of fighting warships, although a frigate was usually more than a match for an individual East Indiaman. These ships sailed on an annual route from China, the East Indies or India carrying trade goods such as spices, <b>tea</b> <b>or</b> silk to Britain. There the goods were sold, and replaced with general cargo including military equipment and troops for the journey back to the Indian Ocean.|$|E

They are typically small, circular, wider than their height and inexpensive. Because of their small size and low level of light, multiple tealights are often burned simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|To utilize edible {{red algae}} paper for food packaging, red algae paper coated with green <b>tea</b> extract <b>or</b> catechin was {{prepared}} and microbial growth in bread wrapped {{with the paper}} was determined during storage. The paper coated with green <b>tea</b> extract <b>or</b> catechin had antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. Packaging of bread with the red algae paper coated with green <b>tea</b> extract <b>or</b> catechin decreased the populations of total aerobic bac-teria and yeast and mold after 2 days of storage by 0. 41 and 0. 63 log CFU/g, respectively, compared to the control.
