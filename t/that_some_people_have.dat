25|$|Kelpies {{are partly}} descended from Dingoes, with 34% of their genes {{coming from the}} native Australian dog. At {{the time of the}} origin of the breed, it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners {{registered}} their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring. There is no doubt <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> deliberately mated dingoes to their Kelpies, and some opinion holds that the best dilution is 1/16–1/32, but that 1/2 and 1/4 will work. As the Dingo has been regarded as a savage sheep-killer since the first European settlement of Australia, few will admit to the practice.|$|E
2500|$|These {{questions}} {{signal a}} marked break from then-current ideas about human diversity, which assumed <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a history, evident {{in a historical}} (or written) record, while other people, lacking writing, also lack history. For some, this distinction between two different kinds of societies explained the difference between history, sociology, economics and other disciplines that focus on people with writing, and anthropology, {{which was supposed to}} focus on people without writing. Boas rejected this distinction between kinds of societies, and this division of labor in the academy. He understood all societies to have a history, and all societies to be proper objects of anthropological society. In order to approach literate and non-literate societies the same way, he emphasized the importance on studying human history through the analysis of other things besides written texts. Thus, in his 1904 article, [...] "The History of Anthropology", Boas wrote that ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of {{this line}} of {{reasoning}} follows several threads. [...] Some reject the argument on grounds relating to personal identity, holding that the fetus is not the same entity as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a [...] "future like ours" [...] in the required sense. Others grant that the fetus has a future like ours, but argue that being deprived of this future is not a significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus, because there are relatively few psychological connections (continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop. [...] Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing: as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears to entail that some killings are far more wrong than others, or <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a far stronger right to life than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.|$|E

2500|$|Sarkar‘s {{economic}} system rests upon {{the concept of}} a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models [...] During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned cooperatives, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large scale key industries. Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation [...] Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises [...] This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business. However, key industries vital {{to the development of the}} country and of strategic importance (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are to complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative. Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed. Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.|$|E
2500|$|After several misadventures, and {{escaping}} from Pontius Pilate, Brian {{winds up in}} a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced {{to come up with}} something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a miracle. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the 'miracles' they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself. [...] Judith is the only one that doesn't leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd outside his mother's house which proclaims him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that [...] "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" [...] and, [...] "There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess, all right, but no Messiah." [...] All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.|$|E
