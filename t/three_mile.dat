5|$|<b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective is a {{scholarly}} {{history of the}} <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island accident, written by J. Samuel Walker and published in 2004. Walker is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's historian and his book is the first detailed historical analysis since the accident.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E

5|$|Walker's {{objective}} in <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island {{was to write}} a comprehensive and authoritative history that would serve as an authoritative record for both the interested public and the NRC.

5|$|On Earth, {{berkelium}} {{is mostly}} concentrated in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|<b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island is J. Samuel Walker's fourth book as the {{official}} historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In the book's preface, Walker tells readers that he had complete independence in its authorship—that the NRC placed no restrictions on what could be said. However, Walker provides a historical account and does not assess {{the performance of the}} NRC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|State Route 160 {{begins in}} eastern Antioch at SR 4. After two interchanges, the highway rises onto the two lane Antioch Bridge over the San Joaquin River. It cuts north across {{the center of}} Sherman Island, {{reaching}} the Sacramento River on the opposite shore. From here to Sacramento, SR 160 never strays far from the river, first following the east levee over the 1949 <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Slough Bridge (a lift bridge), past Brannan Island State Recreation Area, and across SR 12 opposite the river from Rio Vista. After passing Isleton, the highway crosses the river on the Isleton Bridge, a bascule bridge built in 1923, and runs along the west shore on Grand Island, where it meets {{the east end of}} SR 220. The Walnut Grove Bridge carries County Route J11 east across the river to Walnut Grove, and, {{at the north end of}} the island, SR 160 crosses the 1924 Steamboat Slough Bridge onto Sutter Island and then the 1923 Paintersville Bridge across the Sacramento River to the mainland, both bascule bridges.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
