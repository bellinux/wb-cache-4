5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the clues to the puzzle.

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|It {{took several}} years {{and a team of}} assistants <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the scanned {{fragments}} (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky's Judgment in Moscow (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.|$|E
5|$|The fifth known {{storm of}} the year was yet another cyclone first {{identified}} in post-season reanalysis. Forming on September 18 well to the north of Puerto Rico, efforts made <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> wind observations from ships reveal a track that curved toward the northwest, passing about midway between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda before heading northeast. Based on available information, the cyclone is estimated to have remained at tropical storm intensity for its entire existence. It is last noted southeast of New England on September 21.|$|E

Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are forced to work together on a science experiment.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the narrative.

Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E

5|$|In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who {{was then}} acting in New York on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm), needed {{immediate}} medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite {{the fact that}} Christina's character was a 28-year-old and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer Gloria Monty readily agreed. Although Crawford did well in rehearsal, she lost her composure while taping and the director and producer were left to struggle <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk found it hard <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> {{the relationship between the}} main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E
5|$|The German {{survivors}} {{were taken}} to Fremantle and interrogated. Attempts to learn what had happened were hampered by the German officers instructing their sailors to obfuscate the enemy with false answers, people describing events they did not witness but heard of later, and difficulty in keeping groups separated in order to check their stories against each other. Despite this, Australian authorities were able <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> the broad details of the battle, which was verified {{by a group of}} German sailors who had been taken to Sydney instead: their interviews showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as those from Fremantle, and the interrogators concluded that the true story was being recounted. Interrogations were concluded in December, {{and by the end of}} January, Kormorans personnel had been moved to prisoner-of-war camps in Victoria, where they remained until their repatriation to Germany in early 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand of Edgeley Park, {{which in}} 1935 {{was made of}} wood, burned down in a fire, {{destroying}} all of Stockport County's records before 1935. Besides having to rebuild a significant section of the ground, the club had <b>to</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together</b> historical information. The current Main Stand, was built a year later in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe, then President of the Football League. In 1936–37 County won the Third Division North, gaining 60 points and 23 wins. Towards {{the end of this}} season, Stockport had a ten-game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last-day title decider against Lincoln City in which more than 27,000 fans watched. The following season, Stockport finished 22nd out of 22 in the Second Division and were relegated to Division 3 (North) after only earning 31 points.|$|E
