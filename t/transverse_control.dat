A review of <b>transverse</b> (<b>control)</b> structures in torrential streams with focus on function, construction materials and examples of use in Slovenia was made.

Also an analysis of functioning of transverse structures has been made with added equations for simplified hydraulic analysis. In the final part there is a description of current state on torrential activities in Slovenia and solutions i. e. guidelines for improved safety from torrential occurrences and erosion processes. The thesis of transverse structures on torrents {{can be used as}} a foundation for future development of classification of torrential barriers in Slovenia.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites shafts {{find many}} application {{in the modern}} industries due to its flexibility and light weight. The present work deals with the study of finite element analysis and active vibration control of rotating composite shaft system under unbalance forces using three nodded beam element. The composite shafts are modeled as a Timoshenko beam by mounting discrete isotropic rigid disks on it and supported by flexible bearings that are modeled with viscous dampers and springs. Based on first order shear deformation (FOSD) beam theory with transverse shear deformation, rotary inertia, gyroscopic effect, strain and kinetic energy of shafts are derived by adopting three-dimensional constitutive relations of material. The derivation of governing equation of motion is obtained using Hamilton’s principle and solutions are obtained by three-node finite element (FE) with four degrees of freedom (DOF) per node. Active vibration control of the rotating composite shaft has also been implemented using electromagnetic actuator and PD control technique. Various results have also been obtained such as Campbell diagram, transverse displacements, <b>transverse</b> <b>control</b> responses, control currents and control forces in the both directions. The effect of ply orientation on the Campbell diagrams and the transverse responses has also been studied.

The aim of this meta-analysis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a cephalad-caudad compared to transverse blunt expansion of the uterine incision to reduce blood loss in women who underwent low-segment transverse cesarean delivery. We therefore performed a systematic search in electronic databases from their inception until March 2016. We included all randomized trials comparing cephalad-caudad versus <b>transverse</b> (<b>control</b> group) blunt expansion of the uterine incision in women who underwent a low transverse cesarean delivery. The primary outcome was postpartum blood loss, defined as the mean amount of blood loss (mL). Two trials (921 women) were analyzed. After the transverse uterine incision in the lower uterine segment with the scalpel, the uterine incision was then bluntly expanded by the designated method. Blunt expansion of the primary incision was derived by placing the index fingers of the operating surgeon into the incision and pulling the fingers apart laterally (transverse group) or cephalad (cephalad-caudad group). Women who were randomized in the cephalad-caudad group had lower: mean of postpartum blood loss, hemoglobin drop and hematocrit drop 24 h after cesarean, unintended extension, uterine vessels injury, blood loss > 1500 mL and need for additional stitches. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of blood loss > 1000 mL, in the operating time and in post-operative pain. In conclusion, expansion of the uterine incision with fingers in a cephalad-caudad direction is associated with better maternal outcomes and, therefore, should be preferred to transverse expansion during a cesarean delivery...|$|E
