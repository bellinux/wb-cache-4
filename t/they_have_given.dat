5|$|Prem and Poonam {{go through}} the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from {{different}} sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both {{realize the importance of}} the engagement rings that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> to each other and the special right that they have got on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Rosie and Aldermach {{announce}} that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> birth to Callie's sister, Lilith. Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, {{it only took}} a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E

25|$|The two {{countries}} combined {{make up a}} huge percentage of world trade, a significant impact of the cultures of many other countries and territories, and are the largest economies and the most populous nodes of the Anglosphere, with a combined population of around 385 million in 2015. Together, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the English language a dominant role in many sectors of the modern world. In addition to the Special Relationship between the {{two countries}}, most British people perceive the U.S. positively, with the U.S. coming {{in the top three}} of polls consistently; according to a 2015 Gallup poll, 90% of Americans view the United Kingdom favourably.|$|E

25|$|Unconscionable {{agreements}} can be escaped where {{a person}} was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people and companies, whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity {{to make a decision}} to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> their informed and true consent to a contract.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the rest}} of Ireland, the Lurgan area has long been divided into townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. Lurgan sprang up in the townland of the same name.

500|$|Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{wrote the}} dissenting opinion for four Justices, her first major dissenting {{opinion on the}} Court. She wrote that the case {{represented}} [...] "a substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v. Arizona has long provided during custodial interrogation", and that [...] "uspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent—which, counterintuitively, requires them to speak. At the same time, suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> no clear expression of their intent to do so." ...|$|E

I'm an Asian-American. There's the professional competence, but also the inner fear, 'Oh my God, are these britches too big for me?' His heritage is one of focus, of Zen and martial arts". Of the casting, he said that [...] "My goal now is {{to do the best}} job possible playing Harry Kim and to begin repaying my parents for the unaccountable financial support <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> me throughout the years." [...] The pilot of Voyager was broadcast on January 16, 1995.|$|E
500|$|Djungarian hamsters {{reproduce}} at {{a faster}} rate than Syrian hamsters. Phodopus species are able to become pregnant again {{on the same day that}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> birth. This can all happen within a 36-day period. This is done as a survival strategy to produce large numbers of offspring in a short period of time. This places tremendous demands on the mother. Research suggests biparental care in Campbell's hamsters (P. campbelli) but not in Djungarian hamsters (P. sungorus). [...] Frequent fighting can occur between the pups and as soon as they are weaned from their mother, they are separated from her. [...] Most Djungarian hamster dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4" [...] long. Djungarian hamsters breed all year round as no specific breeding season exists.|$|E

[...] Habas was also delighted that the match was won from a goal scored by an Indian player, saying, [...] "I think it is marvellous that Rafique got the winning goal. It is fantastic that an Indian player settled the contest." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball's most notable opponent, Manfred von Richthofen. The Red Baron, who {{believed}} in his younger brother's victory award, considered Ball [...] "by far the best English flying man". Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, [...] "I see <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him the V.C. Of course he won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that." [...] The authors themselves described the story of Ball's life as that of [...] "a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill {{at a time when}} all the world was killing... saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death".|$|E
500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better.

Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
