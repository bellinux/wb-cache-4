To this end, we begin by analyzing whether the changes introduced by the regulator led distribution companies to improve their efficiency; we then address whether <b>the</b> <b>reimbursements</b> paid to <b>the</b> distribution companies are linked to efficiency; lastly, we examine whether consumers benefited from the efficiency improvements. We focus on Spain because the electricity regulator in that country is a longstanding pioneer in the implementation of incentive-based regulatory models. Our analysis was implemented using the regulatory model proposed by Bogetoft (1997) as a benchmark. The results show that the Spanish electricity regulator did not establish a link between efficiency and <b>the</b> <b>reimbursements</b> paid to electricity companies; in addition, the electricity companies benefited to the detriment of consumers.

40|$|In {{the early}} years of the Medicare program, {{proportionally}} more whites than non-whites among the aged used Medicare services. This article examines <b>the</b> use and <b>reimbursement</b> of Medicare services by the aged between 1967 and 1976 to deter-mine if racial differences still exist. To do so, three measures are studied. The first, the number of persons reimbursed for Medi-care services per 1, 000 enrollees, measures access to Medicare's reimburse-ment system. <b>The</b> second, <b>reimbursement</b> per person using reim-bursed services, measures <b>the</b> amount of <b>reimbursement</b> received after persons exceed Medicare deductibles. The third, reim-bursement per enrollee, indicates the combined effect of access and reimbursement and represents a measure of equity for the population at risk. Analysis of the three measures by type of Medi-care service found that the disparities in use and reimbursement of services by race decreased considerably between 1967 and 1976. This trend was found both at the national and at the regional level. Overall, the decreases in the disparity measured are note-worthy. By type of service, proportionally more whites than non-whites still receive reimbursement. However, once non-whites exceed deductibles, <b>the</b> <b>reimbursements</b> per person using reim-bursed services are generally comparable or higher than reim-bursements to whites...|$|R
