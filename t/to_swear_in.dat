25|$|The Court did not {{explicitly}} decide {{whether a particular}} Congress (105th, 106th, etc.) {{had the power to}} expel an individual from a future Congress without that future Congress from being required, after the re-election, the re-swearing in, and the re-seating of a formerly expelled member, to expel the member all over again. The Court, in effect, decided that states were not prohibited from putting on their congressional district ballots and the voters were not prohibited from electing an individual who had been expelled from a previous or current Congress. Once the Congress had satisfied itself that a candidate member had been presented to it, from a congressional district, in accordance with the congressional district's state constitution and laws but was not in conflict with the congressional qualifications set down in the US Constitution, the US Congress had an affirmative constitutional duty to administer the oath to, <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>in,</b> and to enroll the candidate member as a member of Congress.|$|E

When only a song and a fight sequence were left to be finished, Ramachandran could not appear for the shoot, since he had another film to shoot for.

2500|$|From the nation's {{earliest}} days, marshals {{were permitted}} to recruit special deputies as local hires, or as temporary transfers to the Marshals Service from other federal law-enforcement agencies.

Marshals were given extensive authority to support the federal courts within their judicial districts, and to carry out all lawful orders issued by federal judges, Congress, or the President.

Local law enforcement officials were often called [...] "marshals" [...] so there is often an ambiguity whether someone was a federal or a local official.|$|E

[...] He had a reputation, especially among critics, for being hedonistic. Gen. Omar N. Bradley, who intensely disliked Brereton, was quoted by a biographer of Dwight D. Eisenhower as saying that Brereton was [...] "marginally competent...(and) more interested in living in the biggest French chateau". However, from July 1942 {{to the end of the}} war, Brereton had a close association with and was well-regarded by Royal Air Force Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, who found in him not just a fellow bon vivant but an effective air commander on whom he could rely for efficient and competent cooperation.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{formation}} of Hitler's cabinet on 30 January, only three Nazis had cabinet posts: Hitler, Göring, and Wilhelm Frick. The only Nazi besides Hitler to have an actual portfolio was Frick, who held the then-powerless interior ministry. The other eight posts were held by conservatives close to Papen. Additionally, {{as part of the}} deal that allowed Hitler to become Chancellor, Papen was granted the right to attend every meeting between Hitler and Hindenburg. Under the Weimar Constitution, the Chancellor was a fairly weak figure, serving as little more than a chairman. Moreover, Cabinet decisions were made by majority vote. Papen believed that his conservative friends' majority in the Cabinet and his closeness to Hindenburg would keep Hitler in check. To the warning that he was placing himself in Hitler's hands, Papen replied, [...] "You are mistaken. We've hired him." [...] On the morning of 30 January 1933, when Hitler was due to be sworn in as Chancellor by Hindenburg, the [...] "Government of National Concentration" [...] almost collapsed before it began when Hugenberg learned that Hitler planned on dissolving the Reichstag to allow him to get the two-third majority so he could pass the Enabling Act, whereas Hugenberg had been given to believe that the [...] "Government of National Concentration" [...] would rule with the Reichstag elected in November 1932. Passing the Enabling Act would allow Hitler to rule via decree, which would mean that Hitler would not need the support of the DNVP in the Reichstag anymore. Hugenberg knew Hitler well enough to understand what Hitler ruling with the Enabling Act would mean for the DNVP. The discovery that Hitler planned on dissolving the Reichstag caused a lengthy shouting march between Hitler and Hugenberg that delayed the swearing of the Hitler government and was ended when Papen told Hugenberg not to doubt the word of a fellow German and Meissner came out to say Hindenburg was tiring of waiting <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>in</b> the new government. In his 1996 book Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, the American historian Henry Ashby Turner wrote that Papen was [...] "the key figure in steering the course of events toward the disastrous outcome, the person who more than anyone else caused what happened. None of what occurred in January 1933 would have been possible in the absence of his quest for revenge against Schleicher and his hunger for a return to power".|$|E
