5|$|Early in its duration, Hurricane Kate sank one boat near Puerto Rico and {{disabled}} three others. The crew of five on <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> boat were rescued after 17hours.

5|$|Of the 74 German {{ships in}} Scapa Flow, 15 of the 16 capital ships, 5 of the 8 cruisers, and 32 of the 50 destroyers were sunk. The {{remainder}} either remained afloat, or were towed to shallower waters and beached. The beached ships were later dispersed to the allied navies, {{but most of}} <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> ships were initially left {{at the bottom of}} Scapa Flow, the cost of salvaging them being deemed to be not worth the potential returns, owing to the glut of scrap metal left {{after the end of the}} war, with plenty of obsolete warships having been broken up. After complaints from locals that the wrecks were a hazard to navigation, a salvage company was formed in 1923, which raised four of <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> destroyers.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Ballcourt 1 (<b>the</b> <b>Sunken</b> Ballcourt) was {{dedicated}} in 699 by K'inich B'aaknal Chaak to mark three victories over K'inich Kan Balam II of Palenque.

5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives.

An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} was located by Danish divers. The British marine {{archeologist}} Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and {{confirmed that the}} wreck sits upright on the sea floor and is largely intact.

5|$|In a {{hearings}} {{before the}} United States Steamboat Inspection Service, Captain Knowles of El Sol {{and the captain}} of Sac City were both cleared of wrongdoing in the collision, and the blame was laid on the heavy fog. On 31 July, The New York Times reported on the cargo salvage operations still underway on the wreck of El Sol. In three months of continuous operations, the salvage company reported that about 35% of <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> ship's cargo had been recovered. The hulk of El Sol was scrapped later in 1927.|$|E

5|$|On 4 March 1943, {{during the}} Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and {{aircraft}} to attack Japanese rescue vessels, {{as well as}} the survivors from <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service. These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers and reached <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} {{for fear of}} the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|The {{owners of}} <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> vessels were {{compensated}} by the British {{government for the}} loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for 10 of <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> vessels recorded that many had been built in Yorkshire, and the details of the Lord Sandwich transport matched those of the former Endeavour including construction in Whitby, a burthen of 368 71/94tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776. In 1834 a letter appeared in the Providence Journal of Rhode Island, drawing attention to the possible presence of the former Endeavour on the seabed of the bay. This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island, who wrote claiming that Endeavour had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed Liberté. The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty, but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship. It was later suggested Liberté, which sank off Newport in 1793, was in fact another of Cook's ships, the former HMS Resolution, or another Endeavour, a naval schooner sold out of service in 1782. A further letter to the Providence Journal stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a hulk on the River Thames as late as 1825, claiming that the ship had once been Cook's Endeavour.|$|E

5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to <b>the</b> <b>sunken</b> ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E

5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935.
