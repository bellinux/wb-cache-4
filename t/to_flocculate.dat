Whenever a drill hits a salt formation, salt is added to the drilling fluid to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum.

30|$|In fact, {{according}} Malhan et al. {{in their}} reviews manuscript, enhanced nutrient concentrations would indirectly promote viral (virus surrogate: bacteriophage PP 7) persistence by promoting flocculation in situ, which would in turn promote the sorption of viruses <b>to</b> <b>flocculated</b> material and their enrichment. Although flocs represent a passive substrate for viral attachment and persistence, nutrient interactions that promote flocculation would ultimately enhance virus attachment and promote survival, as virus surrogate further work is necessary on enteroviruses {{in the same}} conditions (Shapiro et al. 2013; Malham et al. 2014). In fact, further work is necessary to disentangle the interactions between allochthonous pathogens and estuarine nutrients, {{particularly with respect to}} the impact of enhanced nutrient deposition due to storm events, waste discharges and eutrophication. While we know that microorganisms can associate strongly with flocs, a full understanding of the factors involved in this process is poorly understood.|$|R

2500|$|In oil-in-water {{emulsions}} such as mayonnaise, {{however, the}} continuous water phase freezes, allowing the oil droplets <b>to</b> <b>flocculate.</b> This process causes a phase {{separation between the}} water and the oil. Once ice crystals start to form in the continuous water phase, they begin to inhibit the lecithin and phospholipids from working. These two emulsifying agents lose their functionality due to dehydration: water is crystallizing out, leaving these agents [...] "out to dry." [...] The oil droplets begin <b>to</b> <b>flocculate</b> without the emulsifying agents keeping them separated. At the freezing point of water, this is enough to destabilize the mayonnaise emulsion; at even lower temperatures the fused oil droplets reach their freezing points and fat crystal nucleation begins. These processes make mayonnaise degrade when frozen and thawed; freezing is not a suitable way to store it.|$|E

40|$|In situ intercalative {{polycondensation}} {{is applied}} for the preparation of polyamide (PA) n, 6 -clay nanocomposites, namely poly(ethylene adipamide) (PA 2, 6), poly(hexamethylene adipamide) (PA 6, 6), and poly (dodecamethylene adipamide) (PA 12, 6). For this purpose, two different polymerization routes are considered; a low-temperature melt polymerization technique and the conventional solution-melt one. Under the specific experimental conditions, lack of clay exfoliation is detected through XRD measurements, which is proved irreversible even when twin-screw extrusion is attempted as an additional step. The resulting PA n, 6 -clay structures are found dependent on the diamine moiety length; more specifically, an intrinsic interaction between the polyamide monomer and the organoclay surfactant is indicated. An ion exchange occurs between the two competitive species, that is, diamine and surfactant cations, leading <b>to</b> <b>flocculated</b> clay structures. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Whole, shaken {{and heated}} {{suspensions}} of two Salmonella species were compared as to agglutinability, absorptive capacity and antigenic properties. The results were in general {{agreement with the}} flagellar antigen concept of Smith and Reagh. The removal of flagella by shaking or heating (100 °C.) resulted in altered agglutinability manifested by failure to give a floccular reaction with "whole" antiserum. The deflagellated bacteria were able <b>to</b> absorb some <b>flocculating</b> agglutinin from that serum. They were unable, however, <b>to</b> produce <b>flocculating</b> agglutinin upon injection in rabbits. Untreated, shaken and heated suspensions of a non-motile bacterium (Staphylococcus) showed no differences with respect to agglutinability or absorptive capacity. Soluble precipitable material was found present in small amount in culture filtrates of the motile bacteria and in greater concentration in filtrates of heated suspensions. The bulk of the soluble material was of somatic origin and was not appreciably increased {{by the presence of}} flagella. It was possible, however, to demonstrate soluble material in heated flagellar suspensions. The relation of such soluble substances to floccular agglutination and the production of flocculating agglutinin as suggested by Hadley is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the settled bed in gravitational sedimentation have been studied by many researchers. The settled bed, often composed of flocculated or aggregated particles, is formed from a process of freesettling, followed by consolidation, subjected to compression. Although the free-settling of the particles is well understood, there is scope for advancing our knowledge to explain and predict the {{characteristics of}} the consolidation. The aim of this research was to develop a universal description of the bed consolidation, limited to incompressible systems that do not yield. A series of batch settling tests was conducted using a model experimental system to generate a broad range of data. Hence the initial volume fraction of the particles ranged from 0. 28 to 0. 55. Spherical, low density, particles were used in the batch tests. These model particles exhibited some features similar <b>to</b> <b>flocculated</b> particles. The new theoretical model is used to calculate the quantity of water expressed from each layer of sediment. The water expressed in a time period scales directly with the quantity of expressible water in the layer, and inversely with the lapse time squared. The batch settling test results, defined in terms of the height of the settled solids versus time, were used to validate the theoretical model. Excellent agreement across the full range of solids concentrations was obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{homogenisation}} of {{milk and}} cream has been widely studied but the effect of sonication on the structural and functional properties of cream is not well known. In this study, raw milk, ultrafiltration retentate and cream samples were sonicated at 20 kHz and the rennet and acid gelation properties of these sonicated samples investigated. High pressure homogenisation at 80 bar was also performed for comparison. Sonication of raw milk and retentate samples led to {{a decrease in the}} fat globule size. Conversely, the fat globules in cream samples sonicated at < 10 °C <b>flocculated</b> <b>to</b> form grapelike structures whereas the cream samples sonicated at 50 °C did not form such aggregates. High pressure homogenisation at 50 °C led <b>to</b> similar <b>flocculated</b> structures, but these were not observed at low temperatures. This suggests a potential benefit of sonication technology in allowing low temperatures to be utilised for cream homogenisation, reducing energy demand. However, a gel made using cheese-milk with sonicated cream resulted in separation of a fat layer rather than the incorporation of the fat globules into the gel matrix. Rennet gelation properties of both the sonicated or homogenised samples were significantly superior to a native control sample where the resultant gels had shorter coagulation times and decreased syneresis...|$|R
40|$|Particles in {{the marine}} {{environment}} vary in size from sub-micron colloids <b>to</b> <b>flocculated</b> aggregates {{of the order of}} millimetres. The LISST- 100 (laser in-situ scattering and transmissometer) range of instruments (Sequoia Scientific Inc.) determine the distribution of particle sizes in-situ using laser diffraction, but are limited to specific size ranges governed by the instrument configuration. Using numerical predictions of scattering and a novel observational system to combine digital holography and the LISST- 100 type-c, here we examine the response of the LISST to particles larger than the intended size range of the instrument. For spheres greater than the type-c instrument limit of 500 μm, both theory and observations indicate that the inversion of the recorded scattering into particle size distributions produces volume distributions that peak at varying sizes between 250 and 400 μm. This is caused by the principal peaks in scattering moving off the inside of the ring detectors, leading to the remaining peaks being interpreted as the principal peaks. The aliasing of larger particles as a distribution of smaller particles is also applicable to the type-b configuration of the LISST, only occurring at the 250 μm size limit instead of 500 μm. When extending the Junge particle size distribution up to varying maximum sizes, numerical tests predict an increase in volume concentration of up to 45 %. For power-law distributions with gradients less than that of a Junge distribution, the contamination from large particles becomes increasingly influential over the concentration and shape of the inverted size distribution...|$|R

50|$|The {{soil texture}} is {{determined}} by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil.

40|$|Sedimentary {{soils are}} formed {{due to the}} process of {{settling}} of soil particles in suspension. The settling process is physico-chemical in nature as the soil contains chemically active clay minerals. The extent to which the clay mineralogy affects the settling process depends upon the initial water content of the soil-water suspension. For montmorillonitic soils, the limiting water content at which the nature of settling changes from a discrete free type <b>to</b> a <b>flocculated</b> free type increases with an increase in the soil plasticity and decreases with an increase in the soil plasticity for kaolinitic soils.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a three-part experiment on flocculating emulsions {{in order to}} determine whether ultrasonic spectroscopy could be used to detect and characterize the flocculation process. Three emulsions which represented unflocculated, partially flocculated, and fully flocculated systems were prepared.

Ultrasonic spectroscopic measurements of the flocculating emulsions showed large changes during the flocculation process, which were not readily modeled using single particle scattering theory. The ultrasonic properties of the unflocculated emulsion did not change during the measurement period. The results demonstrate that ultrasonic techniques are capable of detecting the flocculation process.
