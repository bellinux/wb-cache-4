40|$|Twentieth century {{philosophy}} {{is dominated by}} {{an increasing number of}} philosophers who have given up on the Enlightenment project as the quest for unshakeable foundations for philosophical thinking and scientific investigation. The most prominent among them (in the English speaking world) is Richard Rorty. Rorty s thinking on truth will be the central issue in this project. Criticising the foundationalist project common to the Enlightenment and Logical Positivism, Rorty advocates a radical non-epistemological kind of philosophy. This post-epistemological philosophy should be conversational and edifying. A historizing type of philosophy (influenced by both classical Pragmatism and the European hermeneutical tradition), in which truth is seen merely as an expression of consensus among speakers, is seen by Rorty to be the best candidate-successor of Analytic philosophy. The philosophical part of this project includes an analysis of Rorty s debates with prominent analytic philosophers such as John Searle and Michael Dummett. My main focus will be on the concept of truth. The aim of my project is to investigate whether or not the principles of a Rortyan holistic-hermeneutical approach can be fruitfully applied to the philosophy of religion. Can, for example, Christian faith and ethics be redescribed in a post-modern paradigm, like Rorty s. And what does this redescription imply for <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> <b>s</b> claim to truth? Guiding authors on this behalf would include Jeffrey Stout and Don Cupitt. Depending on the results of this analysis I will try to find a viable road for a post-modern philosophy of religion, possibly in dialogue with more moderate post-Enlightenment thinkers such as Charles Taylor and/or Donald Davidson...|$|R
40|$|The article {{argues that}} Galatians does not {{distinguish}} between soteriological and ethical freedom. Freedom encompasses <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> in Christ� <b>s</b> entire salvation. However, he not only possesses freedom in Christ, but has to equally live it fully as a vocation. In as much as law has no salvational role in his life, it also has no ethical roll. � <b>The</b> <b>believer</b> receives <b>the</b> Spirit by faith in Christ. � The Spirit who quickens new life in him, orientating him to Christ, also guides and enables him to do God� s will according to Christ� s faithfulness. The latter is illustrated in His giving of Himself in loving service, even unto a cross, and so doing the will of our God and Father. <b>The</b> <b>believer</b> also glorifies God by doing his will in the loving and serving faithfulness of Christ, by {{the guidance of the}} Spirit. Thus, the believer� s ethic of freedom is fully christological-pneumatological and anomistic without being libertinistic at all. Believers should not fear their God-given freedom by reverting to any form of law observance, but rather celebrate it by trustingly and freely walking in step with the Spiri...|$|R

30|$|Consider {{a domain}} {{involving}} two agents, {{which we call}} <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> and <b>the</b> manipulator. <b>The</b> <b>believer</b> holds some beliefs {{about the state of}} the world, including an initial belief set as well as a mechanism for revision. The manipulator would like to make <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> believe some distinguished formula ψ is true. The way the manipulator tries to bring this about is by specifying a sequence of formulas to be provided to <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> as information to be incorporated. Hence, the manipulator is trying to provide information that causes <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> to perform a suitable sequence of revisions. Note that the manipulator is not providing an argument in the sense of argumentation theory; each piece of information is treated as an independent item by <b>the</b> <b>believer,</b> with no justification. Informally, we describe the manipulator to be “sending messages” to <b>the</b> <b>believer.</b> We assume that <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> receives all messages, but the receiver is not aware of the sender or the sender’s goals. A preliminary version of the framework presented in this section appeared in [24].|$|R

In most cases the tutors were workmates of <b>the</b> <b>believers.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> was not convinced, the tutor would bring it to the attention of their union or professional collectives, and the backwardness and obstinacy of <b>the</b> specific <b>believers</b> were presented in public meetings before <b>the</b> <b>believer’s</b> colleagues.
