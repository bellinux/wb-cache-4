2500|$|In Bahá'í belief, {{creation}} {{has neither}} a beginning nor an end. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>eschatology</b> of other religions {{is viewed as}} symbolic.

The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgment to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the [...] "heaven" [...] of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the [...] "hell" [...] of denial. In this view, the terms [...] "heaven" [...] and [...] "hell" [...] are seen as symbolic terms for the person's spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God. In Bahá'í belief, the coming of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, signals the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of Islam, Christianity and other major religions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{question}} of the place and role of the religious Other in contemporary eschatology. It has three basic aims. First, to investigate how and to what extent ‘theological integrity’ of the religious Other is articulated in <b>the</b> <b>eschatologies</b> of some influential contemporary Christian theologians. Second, to compare the analyses of Christian eschatologies with contemporary <b>eschatologies</b> from <b>the</b> Muslim and Jewish traditions. Provided that some of the mechanisms of inclusion, exclusion and assimilation in Christian <b>eschatology</b> are tradition-specific, <b>the</b> purpose is to discern how the religious Other is approached in these non-Christian eschatologies. Third, to explore avenues for reassessing otherness in Christian <b>eschatology.</b> <b>The</b> study is comparative and correlational and applies two heuristic tools, ‘theological space’ and ‘theological interplay’, in its methodological approach. In this study it is also argued that the mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion are more subtle than the common approach about whether the religious Other will be ‘saved’ may indicate. By means of presenting a more adequate picture, a distinction between soteriological and eschatological openness is suggested...|$|R
2500|$|Mainstream {{scholars}} {{conclude that}} the author did not also write the Gospel of John because of wide differences in eschatology, language, and tone. The Book of Revelation contains grammatical errors and stylistic abnormalities whereas the Gospel and Epistles are all stylistically consistent which indicate its author {{may not have been}} as familiar with the Greek language as the Gospel/Epistles's author. Contemporary scholars note that when Revelation and the Gospel refer to Jesus as [...] "lamb" [...] they use different Greek words, and they spell [...] "Jerusalem" [...] differently. There are differing motifs between the book and the Gospel: use of allegory, symbolism, and similar metaphors, such as [...] "living water", [...] "shepherd", [...] "lamb", and [...] "manna". The Book of Revelation does not go into several typically Johannine themes, such as light, darkness, truth, love, and [...] "the world" [...] in a negative sense. <b>The</b> <b>eschatology</b> of the two works are also very different. Still, the author uses the terms [...] "Word of God" [...] and [...] "Lamb of God" [...] for Jesus Christ, possibly indicating that the author had a common theological background with the author of John.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scholars}} believe <b>the</b> <b>eschatology</b> of Judaism {{and possibly}} the idea of monotheism originated in Zoroastrianism, {{and may have been}} transferred to Judaism during the Babylonian captivity, thus eventually influencing Christian theology. Bible scholar P.R. Ackroyd states: [...] "the whole eschatological scheme, however, of the Last Judgment, rewards and punishments, etc., within which immortality is achieved, is manifestly Zoroastrian in origin and inspiration." [...] However, the theory is questioned by other mainstream historians and scholars. The Oxford History of the Biblical World states [...] "There is little if any effect of Zoroastrian elements on Judaism in the Persian period.". Nevertheless, scholars such as Soloman Nigosian contend, in regarding the similar ideas of Zoroaster and later Jewish writers, that [...] "the ideas were indigenous to Iran...it is hardly conceivable that some of the characteristic ideas and practices in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came into being without Zoroastrian influence." [...] The new faith (Zoroastrianism) emerged in larger Persian empires. [...] " [...] Zoroastrianism reflected the cosmopolitan society of the empires". During this time Zoroastrianism profoundly effected the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam ("Traditions & Encounters: A brief global History", Jerry H. Bentley. pg. 93). It is also possible that Zoroastrianism and later Jewish theology came from a common source.|$|E

40|$|Although {{we live in}} a post-metaphysical age, {{there is}} a renewed {{interest}} in transcendence, especially at the intersection of philosophy, religion, and theology. There are several reasons for this: among others, the important link that <b>the</b> future (<b>eschatology)</b> has with <b>the</b> unknown or that which lies beyond (transcendence). In this article, this relation between eschatology and transcendence is explored by analysing different concepts of transcendence and their possible relations to the future. Jacques Derrida and Catharine Malabou’s concepts of the future are used to shed light on <b>the</b> link between <b>eschatology</b> and transcendence as “impossible”. Secondly, Jean-Luc Nancy’s concept of transimmanence is introduced, in an attempt to find such a possible link. A reconceptualisation of transcendence as transimmanence and a reconceptualisation of <b>the</b> future of <b>eschatology</b> as something “outside within”, facilitate a link between these terms, but the original or general meanings of these terms then become impossible. This outcome urges a rethinking of the meaning and role of transcendence, <b>eschatology,</b> and <b>the</b> future in our post-metaphysical age...|$|R
