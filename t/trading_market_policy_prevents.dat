40|$|In {{the case}} of {{persistent}} dumping, welfare effects are ambiguous. Therefore, the existing international trade theory cannot provide a clear rationale for policies to prohibit international price discrimination. Through a two-stage game on the endogenous foreign monopolist's dumping decision, this paper determines when persistent dumping will negatively affect the home country's total welfare in an oligopolistic domestic market {{in the absence of}} any anti-dumping duties. Key variables of interest in this research include: (i) production costs; (ii) the degree of substitutability among the products; and (iii) the number of domestic firms. With a linear demand and constant marginal cost functions, the model demonstrates that persistent dumping will reduce total welfare if the domestic market is relatively less concentrated, or if the products are close substitutes for each other.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{domestic}} and international <b>trade</b> and <b>marketing</b> <b>policies</b> in India and analyzes the effects of deregulating domestic markets and liberalizing external trade on the food grain sector. Historically, India's food policy has involved heavy government intervention {{in all aspects of}} the food grain market [...] pricing, procurement, stocking, transport and marketing. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the principal parastatal agency responsible for marketing food grains within the country and controls nearly 50 percent of the grain markets. An analysis of the performance of the FCI, however, reveals enormous and mounting costs of operations that present a huge financial burden for the Government of India (GOI). This study offers a comparison of the costs and functioning of the FCI with that of private traders, in order to suggest policy options for reform. The results show that private traders operate at costs lower than those incurred by the FCI in both storage and trade, despite several controls and restrictions imposed upon them.

Excluding drinks, the surplus had more than halved between the start of the 1990 s and the middle of the 2000 s. Frances prospects on the world markets seem to have been weakened because of its concentration on products where the price remains or becomes the competitive criterion, whether they are less processed products (cereals, sugar, poultry meat), or more processed products, such as wine. Conversely, the improved performance of second transformation agri-food products, particularly the gains made on the EU market during 1992, are strengthening Frances positions.

The agricultural sector has characteristics that make it different from industrial or service sectors.

In this application, a global computable general equilibrium model is used to determine trade shocks that are passed to a single country general equilibrium model to analyse employment and wage effects for four skills levels in Indonesian agriculture.

These empirical conclusions carry some important policy implications for the "second wave" of prospective EU members among Southeastern European Countries (SEECs).

40|$|In {{emerging}} <b>markets,</b> <b>policies</b> for <b>preventing</b> {{and managing}} financial crises {{should be understood}} following the standard open economy macroeconomics text treatment. This, however, will prevent us from fully comprehending {{how to deal with}} these crises. To deal with financial crises in emerging markets, this paper brings about more promising theoretical tools borrowed from the interdisciplinary field of optimal policy design. It also considers the possibility that more than one market failure may occur simultaneously. The theoretical tools discussed here should serve to improve existing prevention and management policies. Admittedly, the interdisciplinary field of optimal policy design is comparatively young, thus offering scarce empirical support for disentangling competing models. Given this inability to decide upon the best possible model, we should consider at least two constraints that policy makers will deal with in the real world of financial crises. First, given that policy makers make crucial choices between parsimonious and innovative measures, this paper recommends parsimony because of the uncertainty about the true model. Second, high political implementation costs will always be present, and these are positively correlated with supranational institutional requirements. Considering issues of both parsimony and political constraints, we argue that any attempt to internationally harmonize rules and codes must be done with caution. With this framework in mind, we review some of the recent proposals about emerging markets crisis prevention. From {{the point of view of}} emerging countries and creditor countries taken as a whole, and benevolent IFIs, we conclude that promoting GDP indexed sovereign bonds is the best available proposal for crises prevention. In this paper, we leave aside the debate of the political economy or governance reform issues of the IFIs. ...|$|R
