He previously directed episodes for three other Star Trek series. When asked {{about the use of}} time travel stories in Star Trek in relation to [...] "Carpenter Street", Scott Bakula said that [...] "Obviously it's something you want to be careful of, and {{yet at the same time}} I'm told that the fans love the time travel episodes, and there's certainly an effort on Rick and Brannon's part to write things that they hope the fans will love. This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a relevant topic today." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} several {{reviews of the}} Encyclopedia. One of the harshest criticisms came from the American Library Association in 1987: [...] "The board {{considers}} the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential a problematic monument to idiosyncrasy, confusion, and obfuscation <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not worth purchasing at any price." [...] Similarly, The Guardian [...] was extremely critical in a review article published in 1992, to which Anthony Judge recently responded via Transcend Media Service {{on the occasion of}} the publication [...] in The Wall Street Journal of a page-one sympathetic review of the Encyclopedia initiative, in December 2012. The work itself is keen on presenting, in various places, disclaimers, reservations or warning texts that anticipate criticisms and explain the strengths and weaknesses of its approaches, including the failure to advocate a position, or the sometimes excessive complexity in its methods or language. Most reviews are laudatory, however. Richard Slaughter emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the [...] "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject. As far as practice is concerned, the highest commendation perhaps is to be found in the words of Elise Boulding: [...] "Any one of us (...) can actively become a part in the world problem solving process by using this encyclopedia." ...|$|E

60|$|I don't {{know whether}} I ought {{to offer an}} apology for this {{collection}} which {{has more to do}} with life than with letters. Its appeal is made to orderly minds. This, to be frank about it, is a process of tidying up, which, from the nature of things, can not be regarded as premature. The fact is that I wanted to do it myself because of a feeling that had nothing to do with the considerations of worthiness or unworthiness of the small (but unbroken) pieces collected within the covers of this volume. Of course it may be said that I might have taken up a broom and used it without saying anything about it. <b>That</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> one way of tidying up.|$|E

60|$|Johnnie had {{no clear}} idea what a {{telegraph}} was, and was {{curious to know}} how it would come, rather expecting it to be a man in a red coat on horseback, blowing a horn--a sight <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not to be missed; so he willingly strolled down after Henry to the gate leading to the lane.|$|R
60|$|Of course Old Man Coyote {{has only}} one voice, but that one is such a {{wonderful}} voice that he can {{make it sound like}} a great many voices, all yelping and howling and shouting and laughing at the same time. So those who hear him always say that he has many voices, and <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the way it seems. The first time Peter Rabbit heard Old Man Coyote, he was sure, absolutely sure, that there was a whole crowd of strangers on the Green Meadows, and you may be sure that he kept very close to his dear Old Briar-patch. If you had been there and tried to tell Peter that all that noise was made by just one voice, he wouldn't have believed you. No, Sir, he wouldn't have believed you. And you couldn't have blamed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{the cases}} are different. The storiettes were ground out, jaded, {{at the end of}} a long day of {{application}} to style. But a reporter's work is all hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life. And it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor future, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style, and <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not literature. To become a reporter now, just as my style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary suicide. As it is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect for beauty. I tell you it was sickening. I was guilty of sin. And I was secretly glad when the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into pawn. But the joy of writing the 'Love-cycle'! The creative joy in its noblest form! That was compensation for everything." ...|$|E
60|$|As Gilray {{had owned}} his flower-pot for several months, {{during which time}} (I take him at his word) he had watered it daily, {{he must have known}} he was {{misleading}} me. He said that you got into the way of watering a flower-pot regularly just as you wind up your watch. <b>That</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not the case. I always wind up my watch, and I never watered the flower-pot. Of course, if I had been living in Gilray's rooms with the thing always before my eyes I might have done so. I proposed to take it into my chambers at the time, but he would not hear of that. Why? How Gilray came by this chrysanthemum I do not inquire; but whether, in the circumstances, he should not have made a clean breast of it to me is another matter. Undoubtedly it was an unusual thing to put a man to the trouble of watering a chrysanthemum daily without giving him its history. My own belief has always been that he got it in exchange for a pair of boots and his old dressing-gown. He hints that it was a present; but, as one who knows him well, I may say that he is the last person a lady would be likely to give a chrysanthemum to. Besides, if he was so proud of the plant he should have stayed at home and watered it himself.|$|E

[...] This was in reference to his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis {{as a way to}} avoid being orally sexually assaulted.|$|R
60|$|And while I {{take this}} view of humanitarianism of the anti-Christmas kind, it is cogent to say that I am a strong anti-vivisectionist. That is, {{if there is any}} vivisection, I am against it. I am against the cutting-up of {{conscious}} dogs {{for the same reason that}} I am in favour of the eating of dead turkeys. The connection may not be obvious; but that is because of the strangely unhealthy condition of modern thought. I am against cruel vivisection as I am against a cruel anti-Christmas asceticism, because they both involve the upsetting of existing fellowships and the shocking of normal good feelings for the sake of something that is intellectual, fanciful, and remote. It is not a human thing, it is not a humane thing, when you see a poor woman staring hungrily at a bloater, to think, not of the obvious feelings of the woman, but of the unimaginable feelings of the deceased bloater. Similarly, it is not human, it is not humane, when you look at a dog to think about what theoretic discoveries you might possibly make if you were allowed to bore a hole in his head. Both the humanitarians' fancy about the feelings concealed inside the bloater, and the vivisectionists' fancy about the knowledge concealed inside the dog, are unhealthy fancies, because they upset a human sanity that is certain for the sake of something that is of necessity uncertain. The vivisectionist, for the sake of doing something that may or may not be useful, does something <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> horrible. The anti-Christmas humanitarian, in seeking to have a sympathy with a turkey which no man can have with a turkey, loses the sympathy he has already with the happiness of millions of the poor.|$|E
6000|$|The Duke of Argyll may not {{be aware}} of the fact, but it is {{nevertheless}} true, that when a man's arm is raised, in sequence to that state of consciousness we call a volition, the volition is not the immediate cause of the elevation of the arm. On the contrary, that operation is effected by a certain change of form, technically known as [...] "contraction" [...] in sundry masses of flesh, technically known as muscles, which are fixed to the bones of the shoulder in such a manner that, if these muscles contract, they must raise the arm. Now each of these muscles is a machine comparable, in a certain sense, to one of the donkey-engines of a steamship, but more complete, inasmuch as the source of its ability to change its form, or contract, lies within itself. Every time that, by contracting, the muscle does work, such as that involved in raising the arm, more or less of the material which it contains is used up, just as more or less of the fuel of a steam-engine is used up, when it does work. And I do not think there is a doubt in the mind of any competent physicist, or physiologist, that the work done in lifting the weight of the arm is the mechanical equivalent of a certain proportion of the energy set free by the molecular changes which take place in the muscle. It is further a tolerably well-based belief that this, and all other forms of energy, are mutually convertible; and, therefore, that they all come under that general law or statement of the order of facts, called the conservation of energy. And, as <b>that</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> an abstraction, so the view which the Duke of Argyll thinks so extremely absurd is really one of the commonplaces of physiology. But this Review is hardly an appropriate place for giving instruction in the elements of that science, and I content myself with recommending the Duke of Argyll to devote some study to Book II. chap. v. section 4 of my friend Dr. Foster's excellent text-book of Physiology (1st edition, 1877, p. 321), which begins thus:-- ...|$|E
