40|$|We {{present a}} {{measurement}} of the energy spectrum of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays performed by the <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array</b> experiment using monocular observations from its two new FADC-based fluorescence detectors. After a short description of the experiment, we describe the data analysis and event reconstruction procedures. Since the aperture of the experiment must be calculated by Monte Carlo simulation, we describe this calculation and the comparisons of simulated and real data used to verify {{the validity of the}} aperture calculation. Finally, we present the energy spectrum calculated from the merged monocular data sets of the two FADC-based detectors, and also the combination of this merged spectrum with an independent, previously published monocular spectrum measurement performed by <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array's</b> third fluorescence detector [T. Abu-Zayyad et al.

40|$|System {{optimization}} for extensibility and robustness is {{a fundamental}} challenge of engineering dis-ciplines. Traditional approaches have aimed to optimize cost and performance of a system at a given point in its lifespan. However, as systems evolve with increasing resources and load, system extensibility has {{to be included in}} the earliest stages of planning and deployment. In this thesis, we study the staged deployment of large <b>telescope</b> <b>array</b> configurations as an optimization problem subject to cost, performance and network robustness. The LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) is the world’s largest <b>telescope</b> <b>array,</b> deploying in its full design 25000 antennas over 350 km in diameter in Northern Europe. These are deployed in clusters, and planned to be built in stages, with current funding allowing for 15000 arrays over 100 km. This new generation of <b>telescope</b> <b>arrays</b> requires new system design principles and modelling techniques...|$|R
