5000|$|Hoverlloyd {{commenced}} operations from Ramsgate Harbour to Calais Harbour on 6 April 1966 using small, passenger only SR.N6 hovercraft. When {{the much}} larger SR.N4 craft, capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 254 passengers, were delivered in 1969, Hoverlloyd moved operations to a purpose built ‘hoverport’ in Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate. A similar facility was provided east of Calais harbour and was shared with Seaspeed (who operated into Dover on the UK side of the English Channel). Crossing ('flight') times were as low as 22 minutes. [...] Hovercraft operations were prone to disruption and cancellation during bad weather, although this was eased over time by various modifications to the craft, a typical problem being damage to the rubber 'skirt'. Also, the hovercraft had an unmatched <b>turnround</b> <b>time,</b> {{with the ability to}} disembark/embark cars {{at both ends of the}} craft, whilst simultaneously dealing with foot passengers from two main exits on the port and starboard cabins.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{specimen}} <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> audit, directly controlled by laboratory staff, {{was applied to}} a bacteriology service to assess service efficiency and identify delays and other deficiencies, so that resources could be optimised. The method provided a complete collection of <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> data and was easy to use. Delays of both administrative and technical natures were identified, and with minimal reorganisation the mean <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> was improved...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{institute}} {{recommendations from}} a laboratory <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> study; to evaluate audit methods; and to quantify improvements achieved. METHODS [...] Changes to result report distribution and specimen delivery {{were affected by}} posting results directly from the laboratory followed {{by the introduction of}} a twice daily courier service. Improvements were evaluated by repeating the <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> audit described in an earlier report. Pre-, peri- and post-analytical turnround times were compared before and after changes had been instituted. RESULTS [...] Directly posting general practitioner (GP) results increased the percentage of reports which reached their destination within one and two days after they were generated from 13 to 29 % and from 68 to 82 %, respectively. Pre- and postanalytical times were superimposable before and after posting was started. Corresponding improvements to the satellite hospital service were from 25 to 78 % and from 60 to 82 %, respectively. The courier service shortened the median total <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> from 50 to nine hours for GPs and from 69 to 18 hours for the satellite hospital. Fifty three per cent of GP reports and 21 % of satellite hospital reports arrived on the same day as the sample was taken: 99 % and 94 %, respectively, had arrived by the next day. The number of analytically "old" samples which arrived the day after they had been taken, thus invalidating many results, fell from 25 to 3 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] These audits of laboratory <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> have been used to present a valid case for changes to laboratory transport and to quantify the improvements achieved. They produce consistent and repeatable results, which may also be used to monitor future performance, to assess further changes and to establish the cost-effectiveness of resources used...|$|E
5000|$|The trust {{set up a}} joint venture, Southwest Pathology Services, with Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Integrated Pathology Partnerships in 2012. All routine pathology, {{apart from}} histopathology, is now {{performed}} at a separate site which also handles GP tests. Essential service laboratories are established in the hospitals for urgent tests. <b>Turnround</b> <b>times</b> for both GP and hospital tests has improved and costs have been reduced.|$|R
25|$|Thirty-eight stops {{opened in}} the phased {{introduction}} of tram services in May 2000. Centrale tram stop in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey <b>times</b> slightly. As <b>turnround</b> <b>times</b> were already quite tight this {{raised the issue of}} buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also {{to take into account the}} planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.|$|R
40|$|SCANPS {{performs}} iterative profile searching {{similar to}} PSI-BLAST but with full dynamic programing on each cycle and on-the-fly estimation of significance. This combination gives good sensitivity and selectivity that outperforms PSI-BLAST in domain-searching benchmarks. Although computationally expensive, SCANPS exploits onchip parallelism (MMX and SSE 2 instructions on Intel chips) {{as well as}} MPI parallelism to give acceptable <b>turnround</b> <b>times</b> even for large databases. A web server developed to run SCANPS searches is now available at [URL] The server interface allows a range of different protein sequence databases to be searched including the SCOP database of protein domains. The server provides the user with regularly updated versions of the main protein sequence databases and is backed up by significant computing resources which ensure that searches are performed rapidly. For SCOP searches, the results may be viewed in a new tree-based representation that reflects {{the structure of the}} SCOP hierarchy; this aids the user in placing each hit in the context of its SCOP classification and understanding its relationship to other domains in SCOP...|$|R
40|$|Histopathology audit schemes have {{concentrated}} on the accuracy of diagnosis or the standard of technical work. The most appropriate measure of specimen report time for histopathology was assessed. The simplest method is to calculate the mean or median number of days from receipt of specimens to issue of report, but this takes no account of clinical practice. An alternative approach is to compare the laboratory's performance with the clinicians' requirements. Clinicians were invited to complete a questionnaire specifying the reporting times they required subdivided by tissue type, clinical suspicion of malignancy, and bed occupancy of the patient. The questionnaire showed that there were distinct differences in clinicians' requirements. The <b>turnround</b> <b>time</b> for each category of specimen was calculated and expressed in three ways. The traditional method of quoting a median value showed very few differences among the categories. A comparison of the department's performance with the clinicians' requirements, using an arbitrary cut-off point of satisfying at least 80 % of the clinicians' most stringent requirements or an achievement index, however, provided useful information for refining laboratory priorities...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} current {{performance}} of the clinical biochemistry service provided to general practitioners, with particular attention to result turnround times, and to identify and improvements required. METHODS: Postal questionnaire survey of general practitioners in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets who used the clinical biochemistry laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. A flow analysis study of turnround times for general practitioner samples was also performed. RESULTS: Responses to the questionnaire showed that although 82 % of general practitioners thought the current quality of service provided was better than fair, the actual turnround times achieved were longer than the acceptable times required. There was also a strong demand (> 66 % of responders) for additional information-such as highlighting of abnormal results-to be provided with results. There was wide variability between practitioners {{in their use of}} the laboratory (from none to > 800 requests per year), with no apparent correlation to practice size. Of the repertoire of tests requested, a surprisingly high percentage (14. 3 %) were for thyroid function. Flow analysis of turnround times for thyroid function tests showed that problems lay not with the time taken for analysis (only 7. 8 % of the total <b>turnround</b> <b>time)</b> but with the pre- and postanalytical phases, that is, the sample collection and results delivery service. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the proportion of health care delivered in the primary care sector will inevitably increase the requirement for pathology services. Improvements in the specimen collection and results delivery service to general practitioners are needed to meet their expectations. It remains to be determined whether increased investment in these aspects of laboratory service would result in improved patient care in the primary sector...|$|E
