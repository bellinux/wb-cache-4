40|$|Abraham Lincoln once said, “Character {{is like a}} {{tree and}} {{reputation}} like its shadow. The shadow is {{what we think of}} it and the tree is the real thing. ” How true is that statement? Stop and think about <b>that</b> quote <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Then ask yourself how people view your shadow. If it is not in as positive a light as you would like, then it is probably time to look at the tree. The tree doesn’t lie. It is the real thing. Today, we hear and see the word character every-where. What exactly does it mean and how does it relate to leadership? Character is the inherent complex of attributes that determine a person’s moral and ethical actions and reactions. There are many words that describe good character—words such as honest, inspiring, courageous, unselfish, competent, tactful, loyal, trustworthy, respectful, responsible, fair, caring and citizenship. We will examine the last six in much more detail later in this manuscript. Bennis (1989) said that after vision and passion, integrity (character) is the most fundamental trait of a leader. Character, proper ethics, and integrity are based on the foundation of trust. Do the people you lead trust you in your leadership role? This is something all leaders must ask themselves. If the answer is no or not completely, then {{what can we do to}} develop that trust...|$|R

The man’s timing shows <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very few <b>minutes,</b> the schedule of both trucks coincidentally parks them next to each other. He is casing the armored car. He needs a gang to help him rob it. He selects three men for the gang—the addictive gambler Peter Harris (Jack Elam) wanted for murder, gum-chewing thug Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and the womaniziing Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef). When interviewing them, he wears a mask so they cannot identify him. He has selected them because each has <b>a</b> reason <b>for</b> fleeing the US. They will fit perfectly into Mr. Big’s complex plan, {{which appears to be}} an ordinary robbery but is much more.|$|R
40|$|Honeybees secrete 2 -heptanone (2 -H) {{from their}} mandibular glands when they bite. Researchers have {{identified}} several possible functions: 2 -H could {{act as an}} alarm pheromone to recruit guards and soldiers, it could act as a chemical marker, or it could have some other function. The actual role of 2 -H in honeybee behaviour remains unresolved. In this study, we show that 2 -H acts as an anaesthetic in small arthropods, such as wax moth larva (WML) and Varroa mites, which are paralysed after a honeybee bite. We demonstrated that honeybee mandibles can penetrate the cuticle of WML, introducing less than one nanolitre of 2 -H into the WML open circulatory system and causing instantaneous anaesthetization <b>that</b> lasts <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> The first indication that 2 -H acts as a local anaesthetic was that its effect on larval response, inhibition and recovery {{is very similar to}} that of lidocaine. We compared the inhibitory effects of 2 -H and lidocaine on voltage-gated sodium channels. Although both compounds blocked the hNav 1. 6 and hNav 1. 2 channels, lidocaine was slightly more effective, 2. 82 times, on hNav. 6. In contrast, when the two compounds were tested using an ex vivo preparation–the isolated rat sciatic nerve–the function of the two compounds was so similar {{that we were able to}} definitively classify 2 -H as a local anaesthetic. Using the same method, we showed that 2 -H has the fastest inhibitory effect of all alkyl-ketones tested, including th...|$|R
2500|$|At this point, McPherson sent a note back to Grant {{stating that}} he had been engaged with a Confederate force of about 1,000 men for two hours and was about to get the upper hand. This was an {{incredibly}} accurate statement. [...] So far, the Confederates had only managed to commit the 7th Texas and 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiments, just under 1,000 men in total. [...] Strangely enough, the Confederates engaged now found themselves caught in the same trap that they had planned for the Federals: they had been lured in a disorganized mass across a nearly impassable creek, and now faced the danger of being driven into the creek and slaughtered. [...] The enfilading fire on the 3rd Tennessee began to take its toll, and the its left flank crumbled. [...] Col. Hiram Granbury of the 7th Texas decided to order a withdrawal, then had second thoughts and sent a courier to his right battalion with a message to rescind the order. [...] A timely bullet killed the courier before he could deliver the message, meaning <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few valuable <b>minutes</b> five companies of the 7th Texas regiment were holding back an entire Federal army division. [...] This allowed hundreds of Confederates to withdraw safely across the creek. [...] A final push by the fresh 8th Illinois Infantry regiment finally broke the 7th Texas. [...] A proud veteran regiment that had once boasted that it had never been broken in battle was now reduced to fleeing for its life in scattered groups, with hundreds of Federals in pursuit.|$|R

Domestic and affectionate in his private character, but ready to shed a river of blood in his public capacity. Pure in morals; passionless in his resolves; incorruptible and inflexible; the more dangerous because he had neither passion nor hate; because he had not, like Danton and Marat, a lust for blood, but because human life to him was as nothing, because had he considered it necessary that half France should die {{for the benefit of}} the other half he would have signed their death-warrant without emotion or hesitation.|$|E
50|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well. Case 3. This case illustrates autonomic status epilepticus with frequent vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures at the age of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms <b>that</b> lasted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” The second seizure occurred 6 months later on a ferryboat trip: “He told me that he felt sick, and {{on his way to the}} toilet his eyes and head turned to the right and he was talking out of context, and then he was sick. I thought he was having another fit. He was still able to converse with me in and out of sleep. He did not become unconscious, but he was continuously sick for several hours. By the time we arrived in a hospital 3 hours later, he was improving; he just seemed tired. The doctors told us that this was due to dehydration, for which treatment was provided. He was normal the next morning”. Awake EEG 1 month after the first seizure showed only 1 left-sided occipital and a possible frontal midline spike. A second EEG at 8 years of age showed infrequent central, frontal, and midline spikes during sleep.|$|R
