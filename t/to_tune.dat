5|$|The highest notes {{can have}} a shrill, {{piercing}} quality and can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> accurately. Different instruments often play differently in this respect due to {{the sensitivity of the}} bore and reed measurements. Using alternate fingerings and adjusting the embouchure help correct the pitch of these notes.|$|E
5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> flat to match his intended key.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} has been popular {{in terms of}} his appearance. Nick Levine of media reporting website Digital Spy claimed in a section aimed specifically at gay readers, that Declan (played by Sorensen at the time) {{was one of the main}} reasons <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> into Neighbours after its move in the UK to Five. Levine was commenting on the character's appearance and favoured the character different occasions branding him as 'something nice to look at' and has commented that he is a 'fittie'.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E

50|$|Musicians {{also use}} capos {{to bring a}} guitar tuned below {{standard}} up <b>to</b> standard <b>tuning.</b> Manufacturers sometimes recommend tuning a twelve-string guitar a whole-step or more below standard to offset the additional stress of the additional strings.

5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} gigging that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As {{the most qualified}} musician, Wright was responsible for tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full-time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear {{at the end of}} each gig.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E

25|$|The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamhúr(ok)) are {{stopped with}} tangents {{attached}} to keys {{that change the}} vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> individual notes, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.|$|E
