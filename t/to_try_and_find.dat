5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in Tupelo. After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> the whereabouts of Jesse. The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} when the Golden Gate No.10 mine on the {{northern}} edge of the Golden Gate reef commenced operations, but it is marked on Rands' 1896 map. At the northern end of the line of reef, at varying distances from Golden Gate Creek, a number of prospecting shafts were sunk <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> a continuation of the reef, which had proved so productive further south. No.10 North was at the northern end of the field and here the reef became well defined, although there was a convergence of faults. Mining operations were conducted on a large scale in exploring the reef up to 1906.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, {{but it was just}} an accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing you <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E

[...] Harry is also recruited for Gryffindor's Quidditch team as a Seeker, which is rare for first-year students. [...] While exploring the school one night, Harry and his friends discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. They later find out Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an item {{that can be used}} to grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that his potions teacher Severus Snape is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to a human form. [...] The children learn from Hagrid that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. [...] Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> the stone before Snape does, but discover someone has already put Fluffy to sleep. They get past Fluffy and face a series of safeguards which include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and a dangerous life-sized game of chess.|$|E
500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> chords, which I did with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E
500|$|Simmons uses Will's equipment, {{including}} maps he and {{his team}} made of the surrounding areas, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> a way back through the portal. While out scavenging for food, Simmons sees a metallic reflection in the distance, and follows it to find an old sword and some 19th century astronomy equipment. Realizing that she has entered what Will calls the [...] "No Fly Zone", the area where his fellow astronauts all went before they died, Simmons is soon caught up in another sandstorm—this time, she sees a cloaked figure approaching her and flees back to the cave. Inspired by the astronomy equipment to use the stars and moons, Simmons deduces that the portal's location is fixed but appears to move due to the planet's rotation. By using Will's old NASA equipment and her S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued cell phone she predicts the portal's next opening, but they arrive at the location to find that [...] "it" [...] has apparently altered the landscape to create an impassable canyon between them and the portal. Simmons loses hope of ever returning to Earth as the portal opens and closes in front of them, and resigns herself to life on the planet with Will. The two grow close as time continues to pass.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over Karzai's alleged {{consultant}} work with Unocal (Union Oil Company of California since acquired by Chevron in 2005). In 2002, when Karzai {{became the subject of}} heavy media coverage as one of the front runners to lead Afghanistan, it was reported that he was a former consultant for them. [...] Spokesmen for both Unocal and Karzai have denied any such relationship, although Unocal could not speak for all companies involved in the consortium.

We've exhaustively searched through all our records."Barry Lane: Yeah. Yeah, well that's probably one of the great urban legends. He never worked for us.Jared Israel: He didn't work for somebody else who worked for you?Barry Lane: No. No, not him. He was never a consultant, never an employee.

2500|$|In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, {{was accused}} of having {{committed}} [...] "an act of gross indecency" [...] with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a [...] "catamite". Sudin claimed that on March 13 or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed [...] "area for male prostitutes", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that {{he had wanted to}} get [...] "at the root of the homosexual type of vice and I thought, as it transpires very foolishly, {{that it would be a}} good idea to question a catamite and <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.|$|E
