5|$|However, thanks {{largely to}} the crime {{prevention}} programme Saugus miestas ("Safe City"), crime rates in Žirmūnai, as in all other elderates of Vilnius, are declining. For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Žirmūnai during {{the first four months}} of 2005, versus 672 during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 2006, a decline of about 24%. If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 {{an ornate}} range was erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall.

5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E

Between 2010 and 2011, revenues increased by 16.65% from NT$27.64 billion to NT$32.24 billion, with operating costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) rising by only 4.98%.

Since commencing operations in 2007, THSRC has had a significant influence on Taiwan’s economy and on the lives of its people. In 2011, the Company continued to pursue sustainable growth aligned with the interests of shareholders and society, achieving record profits even amid a challenging economic environment.|$|E

5|$|The A1 {{north of}} the Bosiljevo2 {{interchange}} is operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb {{and the rest is}} operated by Hrvatske autoceste, both of which do not report company toll income separately for individual sections of various motorways. Total toll income reported by Hrvatske autoceste {{in the first half of}} 2011 was 508.1 million kuna (68.3 million euro). This figure pertains to the A1 south of the Bosiljevo2 interchange as well as all other motorways operated by Hrvatske autoceste, however the A1 represents the longest and the busiest tolled motorway operated by Hrvatske autoceste. Toll income reported by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb for the first half of 2011 is 191.2 million kuna (25.7 million euro). This sum includes company toll income generated elsewhere, however the A1 section represents the busiest section of the motorway network operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb.

5|$|Then, as they {{approached}} their target, the MiG-21 pilots would make a supersonic diving pass against trailing or isolated flights, so they could position themselves for a missile kill. The action of 23 August demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Air Force had successfully executed their new procedure, which was helped by more skilful ground controllers who directed the MiG fighter towards their targets. Indeed, the new procedure gave North Vietnamese MiG pilots the ingredient they needed to achieve a kill over their U.S. opponents; between August 1967 and February 1968, the North Vietnamese Air Force achieved a kill ratio of 1.1:1 against the USAF, {{with the loss of}} 20 aircraft for 22 victories. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, Operation Rolling Thunder had cost the United States approximately $900million ($5,640million at 2010 prices) with the loss of more than 700 aircraft.

5|$|At its heyday, the Commonwealth {{comprised}} the territories of present-day Poland, and {{large parts of}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia. It was engaged in the struggles along most of its borders, with only the Western border with the lands of the Holy Roman Empire being relatively peaceful. In its first decades, major conflicts included the Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, the interventions in Moldavia, the Danzig rebellion, and the War against Sigismund. Early 17th century saw {{a number of the}} Polish–Swedish wars, the Polish–Ottoman Wars, and the Polish–Russian Wars (Dymitriads, the Smolensk War). The Commonwealth also suffered from a number of Cossacks uprisings, culminating in the devastating Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648. That period also saw some of the Commonwealth's most talented military commanders: Stanisław Żółkiewski (1547-1620), Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1560-1621), Stanisław Koniecpolski (1593-1646) and Stefan Czarniecki (1599-1665). The Commonwealth managed to hold its weight in most of those conflicts, and scored a number of major victories on all fronts, such as the battle of Kircholm, the battle of Klushino, and had briefly garrisoned Moscow. However, the Chmielnicki Uprising, together with the Russo-Polish War and the Swedish Deluge, all taking place around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the 1650s, proved devastating for the country, resulting in a loss of most of Ukraine to Russia in the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. In 1683 the Commonwealth scored its last major victory that resounded on the European scene, the relief of Vienna by king John III Sobieski. During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly during the Great Northern War. By the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies (the War of the Bar Confederation) led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers. The final attempts to preserve independence of the Commonwealth, including the political reforms of the Great Sejm, eventually failed on the military front, with the Commonwealth defeats in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, ultimately ending in Poland's final partition and the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E
