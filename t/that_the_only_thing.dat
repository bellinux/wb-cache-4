5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> in the members' mind whilst making the album was for the {{listeners}} to enjoy it. He also concluded by saying {{that it would be a}} new start for EXO, after the lawsuits of former band members Luhan and Kris, and that the members would show a brighter, fresher side to their fans.|$|E

25|$|Sørvágur {{has always}} been a place where fishery has been very dominant. In older times it was said, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> {{necessary}} for survival in Sørvágur was that you had a fishing rod and a pot to cook the fish. The fishing industry also plays a vital role in the industrial environment in Sørvágur today (2005). Today there is a modern fish factory producing mainly salt fish; a fish farm raising salmon; one fish market; one major fish factory ship, which produces fish directly to the British market; 6 smaller fishing trawlers and 50+ small fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though we know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> implied about them is that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus {{the names of the}} Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E
25|$|Devastated, Kent hires {{investigators}} {{to look into}} the background of the pair. It is discovered that Marchmont's real name is Tommy Pierce, a two-bit con artist who is wanted by the police in several countries. Kent also finds out that Norma's first husband, who Kent knew about, never legally divorced Norma, so technically she is a bigamist. Deciding to teach the pair a lesson, he pairs the private {{investigators to}} follow them and ensure that they cannot part from one another. It soon becomes apparent to Norma <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that Marchmont/Pierce was interested in was her jewels, and she has to resume her chorus girl activities in order to support Marchmont/Pierce's drinking habit. However, when either of the two attempts to leave, they are returned to each other, under threat of turning them over to the police for arrest. There are only two problems with this plan: Kent is love Norma; and Norma has fallen in love with Kent.|$|E

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the same}} tone as the French debate, {{much of the}} {{discussion}} revolved around {{the economy and the}} environment. The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar to the Bush administration, and Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the oil companies and companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, {{people have}} widely {{regarded}} Neutopia as a clone of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda.

[...] He then stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that had stopped the [...] "Yes" [...] side was [...] "money and ethnic votes" [...] and that the next referendum would be successful with only a few percentage more of French speakers onside.

Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz complimented the interpolation of [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", describing it as [...] "nostalgic", and further stated that Carey embodies the [...] "bravado" [...] of American singer Jennifer Holliday in the broadway musical Dreamgirls. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner praised Dupri for producing a piano [...] "disco stormer" [...] with throwback appeal.

500|$|Collins then {{burst into}} tears and exclaimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> she had ever gotten from the store without paying was her free lunch. [...] This {{prompted}} renewed questioning from the investigator and manager because of the differing policies regarding free lunches at lobby food operations (not allowed) versus stores with lunch counters (allowed). Collins again requested and was refused {{the presence of a}} union representative. Based on the questioning, the investigator prepared a statement that Collins owed $160 for lunches but she refused to sign the statement. It was later found that most (if not all) of the employees at Store No. 98 (including the manager) took free lunches because they had never been informed of the policy prohibiting it. When the investigator contacted company headquarters during the interview, the company itself was uncertain whether the policy against free lunches was even in effect at that store.|$|E
500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, {{in the sense of}} loss of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, in the sense of untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads that beautiful things naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, or the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that does not change is change. [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six. [...] Both change and eternity are then acknowledged and challenged by the final line.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{was fascinated}} by the Zeus debate, {{especially}} the way that scientists were lined up on diametrically opposed positions for or against the system.

[...] His fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on Zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on the topic. In one meeting with Edward Teller, Kennedy demonstrated that he knew more about the Zeus and ABMs than Teller. Teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to the same level of knowledge. Wiesner would later note that the pressure to make a decision built up until [...] "Kennedy came to feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> anybody in the country was concerned about was Nike-Zeus." ...|$|E
