40|$|This article {{inspects}} {{a set of}} paradoxes {{that appeared}} in an investigation of contemporary <b>industrial</b> <b>craft</b> in the last remaining factory making machine lace in the United Kingdom. Its focus on a single site, set against a now global industry, means it can build on work in cultural and economic geography to understand this setting as a heterogeneous space, with links {{to a range of}} material and immaterial lineages, practices and networks. Ethnographic fieldwork on the factory floor at Cluny Lace threw up three paradoxes inherent in the firm’s continued survival in a context of industrial decline. The first of these paradoxes is the reconcentration of material and immaterial resources in the factory both despite {{and as a result of}} the global restructuring of the textile industry. The second is the embodiment of knowledge, and therefore craft skill, both within persons and distributed through the worker’s material environments. Third, is the recognition that the skilled practice the workers carry is not uniform but is multiple, resulting from an unequal distribution of opportunities within the lace industry and different versions of practice that result from the re-concentration of human capital in the factory. This article demonstrates that skill is not uncontested, but is power-ridden and value-laden, and transcends scale. It shows that knowledge and skill are not bound within an individual but are distributed among social actors, material objects and locales, where an attention to each is necessary for understanding the spaces of skilled practices and the ongoing survival of contemporary <b>industrial</b> <b>craft</b> production...|$|R

To develop P/M process for bronze using a general electric furnace and paraffin as binder, process parameters (paraffin content, debinding and sinterring temperature, etc) are determined experimentally. In conclusion, paraffin content is 8 %, debinding is done at 250 ℃ for 3 Hr, sintering is done at 750 ℃ for 4 Hr.

40|$|Factory is a performative {{installation}} {{that reflects}} upon notions of place, skill, people and material objects left behind following {{the process of}} industrial change. Since the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, progressive deindustrialisation that occurred in many countries in Western Europe and the United States has led to much of traditional manufacture being replaced by tertiary industry. As many of Stoke-on-Trent’s ceramic factories have been substituted by service, retail and distribution sectors, there exists {{a break in the}} passing on of trans-generational skill, and with few apprenticeships a danger of specific skills disappearing.

From its origins as a rural and <b>industrial</b> <b>craft,</b> blacksmithing has emerged in the form of art-blacksmithing. Institutional and government intervention, new technologies and markets provide {{the context in which the}} ideologies and practices are examined. It is argued that these new blacksmiths are selfconscious designer-makers who are technically innovative, and commercially aware, operating successfully between and within the cultural and commercial arenas. In combining practical and decorative functionalism, and producing site-specific art work at a competitive price, artist blacksmiths successfully inhabit the worlds of art, industry, trade and craft, often simultaneously...|$|R
