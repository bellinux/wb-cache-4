25|$|Soviet rocket {{tests to}} Kamchatka {{during the late}} 1950s {{increased}} interest in Shemya Island, Alaska at the western Aleutians {{as a location for}} monitoring missile tests from the far northeastern Soviet Union. Old site facilities were rehabilitated and new ones constructed on the island, including a large detection radar (AN/FPS-17), which went into operation in 1960. Each of three antenna reflectors were similar to the initial FPS-17 at Diyarbakir but employed a different feed horn array and beam scanning method. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> was constructed nearby. Blue Fox refers to a modification of the AN/FPS-80 <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> to the AN/FPS-80(M) configuration in 1964. These radars were closed in the 1970s when the Cobra Dane phased array radar was built to monitor missile tests. Shemya was redesignated from an Air Force station to an Air Force base in 1968.|$|E

5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> and Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|R
25|$|Once {{a target}} {{was found on}} the LOPAR it could be {{identified}} with aid of an Identification friend or foe system. The LOPAR provided rough range, azimuth and limited altitude or elevation information to the operators of the Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> (TTR), who would manually slew the TTR onto the target. Once locked-on, tracking was automatic.|$|E
25|$|The Super Fledermaus {{fire control}} system was {{designed}} and built by the then separate Contraves company. It consists of a four-wheeled towed trailer with an E/F band pulse doppler search radar {{with a range of}} around 15km and a pulse doppler <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> operating in the J band, also with a range of 15km. It was also used as the fire control system on the Gepard SPAAG.|$|E
25|$|After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced {{during the}} Cultural Revolution as reactionary and {{therefore}} forced {{to retire from}} all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelledâ€”the Fanji ABM system, the Xianfeng Anti-Missile Super Gun, the ICBM Early Warning Network 7010 <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the many}} Defender {{projects}} were several studies {{based on the}} concept that a re-entering nuclear warhead would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects radar waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> on the single return from the warhead.|$|E
25|$|The Skyguard {{system is}} {{contained}} within a towed trailer, {{mounted on the}} roof of which is a pulse doppler search radar, a pulse doppler <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> and a co-axial television camera. The trailer also houses the crew of two and a small petrol generator. Skyguard is an all-weather air defense system for the control of aircraft at low altitude and at low and medium altitude range up to 3,000 m. The maximum effective distance is given as 4,000 m. The system takes the air surveillance, target acquisition, calculation of the derivative-action values and the control of two Oerlikon 35mm anti-aircraft guns. Skyguard is served by four people.|$|E
25|$|In December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was {{conducted}} when Iraq refused UNSCOM inspections. On 28 December 1998, three F-15Es each dropped two GBU-12 500-pound precision-guided munitions (PGMs) to successfully strike an SA-3 <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> and optical guidance unit. After Desert Fox, Iraq {{stepped up its}} violations of the no-fly zones, thus a number of retaliatory and pre-planned strikes were conducted by F-15Es; in ONW alone, weapons were expended on at least 105 days. Between 24 and 26 January 1999, F-15Es expended several AGM-130s and GBU-12s against SAM sites in northern Iraq near Mosul. Several F-15Es also flew in support of Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Provide Comfort II.|$|E
50|$|Longer range {{missiles}} generally use radar {{for early}} detection and guidance. Early SAM systems generally used <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> and fed guidance information to the missile using radio control concepts, {{referred to in the}} field as command guidance. Through the 1960s, the semi-active radar homing (SARH) concept became much more common. In SARH, the reflections of the <b>tracking</b> <b>radar's</b> broadcasts are picked up by a receiver in the missile, which homes in on this signal. SARH has the advantage of leaving most of the equipment on the ground, while also eliminating the need for the ground station to communicate with the missile after launch.|$|R
50|$|Four {{modified}} TALOS AN/FPW-2 Guidance Pedestals were slaved {{to either}} {{or both of the}} AN/FPQ-4 <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> in order to provide optical, infra-red and other supplementary instrumentation for the observation of re-entry bodies.|$|R

25|$|As a night fighter {{that was}} not {{expected}} to be as fast as smaller daylight fighters, the expectation was to have a stable platform for its radar system and the four 20mm cannon mounted in the lower fuselage. The F3D was, however, able to outturn a MiG-15. The fire control system in the F3D-1 was the Westinghouse AN/APQ-35. The AN/APQ-35 was advanced for the time, a combination of three different radars, each performing separate functions: an AN/APS-21 search radar, an AN/APG-26 <b>tracking</b> <b>radar,</b> both located in the nose, and an AN/APS-28 tail warning radar. The complexity of this vacuum tube-based radar system, which was produced before the advent of semiconductor electronics, required intensive maintenance to keep it operating properly.|$|E
25|$|Freeman {{made his}} acting debut at age nine, playing {{the lead role}} in a school play. He then {{attended}} Broad Street High School, a building which serves today as Threadgill Elementary School, in Greenwood, Mississippi. At age 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while still at Broad Street High School, he performed in a radio show based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1955, he graduated from Broad Street, but turned down a partial drama scholarship from Jackson State University, opting instead to enlist in the United States Air Force and served as an Automatic <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> Repairman, rising {{to the rank of}} Airman 1st Class. Freeman's service portrait appears in his character's funeral scene in The Bucket List.|$|E
25|$|Swordfish Long Range <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar,</b> a 3D AESA was {{developed}} with assistance from Elta of Israel and {{is similar to}} Elta's proven GreenPine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedisation. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500km. It can detect Intermediate-range ballistic missile. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the FPS-17 {{technology}} led directly {{to the development of}} the larger and more powerful Ballistic Missile Warning System (BMEWS). BMEWS detection and <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> were prototyped on Trinidad Island and the operational installations were made at Thule, Greenland; Clear, Alaska; and Fylingdales Moor, UK.|$|R
25|$|This {{system was}} {{deployed}} to satisfy {{scientific and technical}} intelligence collection requirements during the Cold War. The first installation (designated AN/FPS-17, XW-1) at Diyarbakir was originally intended to provide surveillance of the USSR's missile test range at Kapustin Yar south of Stalingrad - especially to detect missile launchings. The data it produced, however, exceeded surveillance requirements, permitting the derivation of missile trajectories, the identification of earth satellite launches, the calculation of a satellite's ephemeris (position and orbit), and the synthesis of booster rocket performance. The success achieved by this fixed-beam radar led to the co-location of a <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> (AN/FPS-79), beginning in mid-1964. Together, these radars had the capability for estimating the configuration and dimensions of satellites or missiles and observing the reentry of manned or unmanned vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Each {{air force}} base is {{equipped}} with air field radar approach systems (AFRAS) that monitors air traffic within the Air Field's operational sector 24 hours per day. These systems include primary approach radars, precision approach radars, and secondary surveillance radar and display systems. These systems {{have a range of}} more than 120km. The AFRAS are maintained by Saab Grintek as well as Tellumat. Air Force Base Overberg in the Western Cape is also equipped with a Doppler <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> and is used primarily by the Test Flight and Development Centre SAAF and the Denel Overberg Test Range for aircraft and missile development tests. In the Western Cape there is a radar station at Kapteinskop, jointly used by Air Force Base Langebaanweg and Cape Town International Airport to monitor air traffic. Air Force Base Makhado has another radar station located in the mountains {{to the north of the}} main base complex apart from its AFRAS radar (located in the main base itself).|$|E
25|$|The British Maritime and Coastguard Agency had {{the last}} known radio contact with the vessel as it was passing through the Strait of Dover on July 28. Nothing {{extraordinary}} was detected during the communication, though authorities believe that the crew was coerced not to raise an alarm by the hijackers. The ship continued to send Automatic Identification System signals until July 30. A press-secretary of the Swedish Police Authority confirmed {{that one of its}} investigators had a phone contact with a crew member on July 31, but refused to disclose its nature. No communication occurred after that; the ship failed to come to BÃ©jaÃ¯a on its scheduled arrival date, August 5. Coastal <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> last picked up the ship's signal near Brest, France; it was later reported being observed by a patrol aircraft near the Portuguese coast. The vessel was never seen passing through the Strait of Gibraltar. A hijack alert was issued by Interpol on August 3.|$|E

25|$|Guidance is {{performed}} by the target <b>tracking</b> <b>radar,</b> it constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and {{on the basis of}} this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8Ã— magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead weighs about 9kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600mm long, 6 to 9mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 2â€“3grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 2â€“3grams. The 9K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).|$|E
500|$|Any {{target with}} a high {{probability}} was then passed to the Battery Control Data Processor (BCDP), which selected missiles and radars for an attack. This started with the assignment of a Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> (TTR) to a target passed to it from the DCC. TTRs operated in the C band from 5250â€“5750MHz at 10MW, allowing tracking of a 0.1m2 target at , a range they expected {{to be able to}} double with a new maser-based receiver design. Once targets were being successfully tracked and a firing order was received, the BCDP selected available Zeus missiles for launch and assigned a Missile <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> (MTR) to follow them. These were much smaller radars operating in the X-band between 8500â€“9600MHz and assisted by a transponder on the missile, using only 300kW to provide missile tracking to [...] The wide variety of available frequencies allowed up to 450 MTRs to be operating in a single Defense Center. Information from the ZDR, TTR and MRTs was all fed to the Target Intercept Computer (TIC) which handled the interceptions. This used twistor memory for ROM and core memory for RAM. Guidance commands were sent to the missiles in-flight via modulation of the MTR signal.|$|E

The Swordfish Long Range <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radar</b> of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation is an acknowledged derivative of the original Green Pine. The Indian government has sought to purchase the complete Arrow system since 1999, but in early 2002 the U.S. vetoed Israel's request to sell the Arrow 2 missiles to India, exercising its right as a major funding contributor.
