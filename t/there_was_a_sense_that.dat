5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

For the 2005–06 season, the Spurs {{acquired}} the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel. Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise best record of 63–19. The Spurs met the Mavericks {{in the second round of}} the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4–3, including a 119–111 overtime victory in Game 7.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

500|$|According to Judge Jay Bybee of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, {{those in}} favor of popular {{elections}} for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by the original provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> senatorial elections were [...] "bought and sold", changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857 and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In 1900, for example, William A. Clark had his election voided after the Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature. But analysts Bybee and Todd Zywicki believe this concern was largely unfounded; there was a [...] "dearth of hard information" [...] on the subject. In {{more than a century}} of legislative elections of U.S. senators, only 10 cases were contested for allegations of impropriety.|$|E

500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed {{to fall in love with}} the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.8/10 rating. Characterising the episode as [...] "the quiet before the storm, the {{seemingly}} innocuous bottle episode {{that ends up}} being the precursor to a slam-bang conclusion", he wrote that the episode [...] "gets the job done", specifically praising Tate for her ability to [...] "carry {{the weight of the}} episode". He highlighted the cliffhanger of the scene—when the Doctor realises that Donna met Rose, and subsequently deduces the universe is in danger—as the best moment in the episode; he wrote that it was [...] "a great moment, and sets up a premise suitably large for Davies' farewell episodes." [...] He criticised two major points of the episode: he thought the beetle prosthetic did not look convincing, and undermined Donna's questions of why people were looking at her back; and he thought the episode was Davies' highlight reel, reminiscent of someone reminding the viewer of an event and then moving to the next slide. Closing, he wrote that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> [...] "something was missing from the proceedings", but commented that the episode [...] "serves as a good set up for the two-part climax of season four".|$|E

2500|$|For {{many who}} opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend {{what they saw}} as the {{fundamentally}} Protestant identity of the Church of England.

The Economic Club was founded by Federal City Council members Ed Hoffman (president of Woodward & Lothrop) and R. Robert Linowes (a successful local attorney). The goal was two-fold: First, to provide a way for business leaders to socialize, become acquainted with one another, and form a sense of community; second, to expose its members to new thinking and ideas in the realm of economics. The group has since become [...] "a cornerstone of the Washington business community", largely {{on the basis of its}} ability to bring a group of top-level business leaders together to listen to policymakers.

On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, {{has nothing to do}} with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{summaries}} of Clarkson's time as governor general, however, {{found that the}} increased travel abroad attracted negative attention to the viceregal post over costs and caused conflict between domestic duties and foreign obligations. Also, {{it was observed that}} Clarkson had succumbed too easily to the desires of her advisors both in the prime minister's and Privy Council offices, as well as amongst the staff of Government House to turn the viceregal post into something it was not: Canada's head of state. Clarkson had expressed admiration for the Queen, was said to understand [...] "the lustre the Crown affords," [...] and to have [...] "shudder a little in sympathy with members of the Royal Family at the degree of intrusion into their lives they must bear." [...] But the systematic downplaying of the monarch led to confusion over who was head of state and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that,</b> by taking this view, Clarkson and her office were overturning the long-standing theory that all the viceroys and their respective jurisdictions are equal under a sovereign who reigns consistently over the whole country. When Clarkson attended a provincial occasion, her protocol officers insisted that she take precedence over the pertinent lieutenant governor and denied knowledge of the established order in which the lieutenant governor, as a direct representative of the Queen in a province, takes precedence at a provincial function over all other attendees, save for the monarch. These situations would result in [...] "precedence battles", in which the provincial authorities would frequently acquiesce to pressure and ultimatums from Rideau Hall. Clarkson also took the place of the monarch in presenting to the next vicereine the Chancellor's insignia of the Order of Canada, thereby breaking the order's [...] "first and oldest tradition"; a move Canada's expert on honours, Christopher McCreery, called [...] "a rather bizarre turn of events". The Monarchist League of Canada even reported that a member of parliament had telephoned to ask if they had ever before heard of the eruption of booing at the mention of the governor general's name, as had apparently happened in the MP's riding when Clarkson was spoken about.|$|E
