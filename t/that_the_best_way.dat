5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing to}} a {{televised}} sex-help program, Peggy decides <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to rekindle {{her relationship with}} Al is to have sex in a different location. Upon Marcy's recommendation, Peggy and Al go to the Hop-On-Inn and discover a videotape waiting for them in their room. After watching some of the tape, the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video is Steve and Marcy. Although Al is disgusted, the action turns Peggy on and the couple has sex.|$|E

5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I was told <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to survive those first {{years in the}} Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought {{you would like to}} be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me {{there were a number of}} the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|For {{some twenty}} years, Teller advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, {{and on the}} {{building}} of a hydrogen bomb in particular. In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, telling him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> {{to ensure}} {{minority}} representation in Parliament was {{to introduce the}} GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, {{as it would be}} economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E

5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, realizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> {{to create a}} tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought {{that this would be}} enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mariëndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied {{philosophy}} at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch; {{during this time}} he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some {{of the results of}} the 27th International Eucharistic Congress, held in Amsterdam in 1924, for the Javanese-language magazine Swaratama, which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java. He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

50|$|I was not {{interested}} in playing Christ. It's like playing Hamlet. I just didn't want to do it. Marty and I talked about it. We do things with each other because we like to work together, but also for our separate reasons.

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} French {{garrison}} on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley {{had turned his}} attention eastwards to Isle de France. The British commander had decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the harbours through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle de France. These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the harbours, effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in Sirius and Willoughby in Nereide, with instructions to begin by seizing Île de la Passe {{at the entrance to}} the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

50|$|The Society {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{branches}} of the Marianist Family. Along with the other branches, the Marianist Brothers and Priests look to Mary as a model for faith and spirituality, and they feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> to live a spiritual life are to share their faith with others, work with the poor, and educate and nourish the mind, the body, and the soul.|$|R
5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack {{on the morning of the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E

5|$|Takumi felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> {{to write}} a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that {{was to make the}} gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because {{he thought it would be}} more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese government's pre-war {{plans to}} protect the country from air attack focused on {{neutralizing}} enemy air bases. Before the war {{it was believed that}} Soviet aircraft based in the Russian Far East posed the greatest threat. The Japanese military planned to destroy the air bases within range of the home islands if Japan and the Soviet Union ever went to war. When the Pacific War began, the Japanese government believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to prevent American air raids was to capture and hold the areas in China and the Pacific from which such attacks could be launched. It was expected that the Allies {{would not be able to}} re-capture these bases. However, the Japanese anticipated that the Allies might still make small-scale attacks against the home islands using naval aircraft flying from aircraft carriers. The government chose not to develop strong defenses to meet the threat of air attack as the country's industrial resources were unable to maintain offensive air forces in China and the Pacific as well as a defensive force in the home islands.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> {{to accomplish this}} is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana {{to return to the}} now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond {{the point of no return}} by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started.|$|E
