25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

With the strong support of Giacomo Meyerbeer, it was accepted for {{performance by the}} Dresden Court Theatre (Hofoper) in the Kingdom of Saxony and in 1842, Wagner moved to Dresden. His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his [...] "Autobiographic Sketch" [...] of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, [...] "For the first time I saw the Rhine—with hot <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland."

But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E

500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Worlds Apart" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted {{that with the}} closing of the bridge, [...] "Fringe effectively pulled the plug on the creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't think we can understate the passing of the parallel world premise." [...] While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series [...] "got the emotions [...] just right." [...] He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, [...] "I was so sad. [...] I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when we closed the door". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she [...] "was so wrong".|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{appointed}} a backroom staff of former Norwich colleagues, making Ian Crook first-team coach and John Deehan chief scout. However, the initial turnaround in form {{could not be}} maintained; having lost their last three games of the season, Norwich were relegated from the Championship. Gunn labelled his players as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] after the 4–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic that sealed relegation to League One. Despite relegation to the third tier of English football {{for the first time}} in nearly 50 years, Writing in Tales from the City, Gunn said of the match [...] "Even going to Charlton on the last day, I thought we could survive… We lost 4-2 and were relegated to the third tier. I was shell-shocked; the emptiest I have ever felt in a sporting or professional context. The directors went on the field to face the fans and to thank them for their support and I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when I saw Delia and Michael doing that. I told them how sorry I was." ...|$|E

500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I {{was so proud of}} them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E
500|$|Richmond {{fell ill}} {{the day after}} the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York City. He was not well enough to begin the 1987 NASCAR season despite lengthy {{hospitalization}} in Cleveland and further rest at home; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500, his condition was reported as double pneumonia. Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 {{during the middle of the}} year. Starting third, he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over Bill Elliott. In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth (high) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, [...] "I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when I took the checkered flag. Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again." [...] Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a blown engine. He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987.|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of}} my heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I ask you if you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Melián Lafinur.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{an ancient}} record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was {{intended}} to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: [...] "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered." [...] Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.|$|E
60|$|If <b>tears</b> were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> before, they flowed {{too fast}} {{now to be}} restrained, and I gave him but too much {{satisfaction}} by my looks that I had yet no reflections upon my mind strong enough to go that length, and that I could no more think of parting than he could.|$|R
60|$|I say, I confess the inhumanity of {{this action}} moved me very much, {{and made me}} relent exceedingly, and <b>tears</b> stood <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> upon that subject; but with all my sense of its being cruel and inhuman, I could never find <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart to make any restitution. The {{reflection}} wore off, and I began quickly to forget the circumstances that attended the taking them.|$|R
60|$|So she ended, and {{listening}} to her, I felt the <b>tears</b> rising <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{because she was so}} much alone, and I feared that this god of hers would never come to save her from the torments of the priests.

2500|$|In 2005, manager Ozzie Guillén led the White Sox to a World Series victory, {{their first}} in 88 years. Thomas {{was not on}} the post-season roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his {{perennial}} contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the Division Series against the Boston Red Sox. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. [...] "What a feeling", Thomas said. [...] "Standing [...] all around the place. People really cheering me. I had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> To really know the fans cared that much about me – it was a great feeling. One of my proudest moments in the game." [...] Though Frank Thomas {{was not on the}} post-season roster, he did earn a World Series ring for his contributions during the season.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} a demo tape, Traa Daniels joined the band in 1994 {{when they needed}} a bassist for some shows to replace Portillo. P.O.D. signed with Rescue Records, a label created by Bernardo's father, Noah Bernardo Sr., who was also the band's first manager. Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, Snuff the Punk, Brown and Payable on Death Live. Longtime manager Tim Cook was first introduced to the band when he booked them to play his club The Where-House in Bartlesville, Oklahoma following strong local word of mouth support. He later described their performance by saying: [...] "I stood {{at the back of}} the venue with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> – it was the greatest thing I had ever seen." [...] By that point, Bernardo Sr. was looking for someone else to take P.O.D.'s career further and so Cook took over as manager.|$|E
