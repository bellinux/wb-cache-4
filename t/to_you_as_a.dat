2500|$|A popular {{paean to}} the Ganges is the Ganga Lahiri {{composed}} by a seventeenth century poet Jagannatha who, legend has it, was turned {{out of his}} Hindu Brahmin caste for carrying on {{an affair with a}} Muslim woman. Having attempted futilely to be rehabilitated within the Hindu fold, the poet finally appeals to Ganga, the hope of the hopeless, and the comforter of last resort. Along with his beloved, Jagannatha sits {{at the top of the}} flight of steps leading to the water at the famous Panchganga Ghat in Varanasi. As he recites each verse of the poem, the water of the Ganges rises up one step, until in the end it envelops the lovers and carry them away. [...] "I come <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child to his mother," [...] begins the Ganga Lahiri. [...] I come as an orphan to you, moist with love. [...] I come without refuge to you, giver of sacred rest. [...] I come a fallen man to you, uplifter of all. [...] I come undone by disease to you, the perfect physician. [...] I come, my heart dry with thirst, to you, ocean of sweet wine. [...] Do with me whatever you will.|$|E
2500|$|Men {{and women}} hold unique roles in Tongan society. A man usually holds {{the power and}} is {{considered}} {{the head of his}} household. However, a man has an obligation to care for his sister and her children. So in Tongan families ones maternal uncle or Fa'etangata, is considered lower in ranking because of his obligation {{to take care of the}} needs of his sister and her children. Contrastly in Tongan families your paternal aunt is the highest-ranking member and is referred to as mehekitanga or Fahu. Men hold power and women hold rank. In ancient Tonga one would inherit titles, land and people from their mother, after Christianity this was changed to mainly inheriting from ones father. Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families. At one time it was inappropriate for a brother and sister to even watch television together if the characters were to kiss or even flirt on screen. That is mostly laxed in the modern age, but you still have families that will separate the boys and girls when watching TV or movies. The notion of faka'apa'apa is still strong but the meaning of it is slowly changing especially amongst the youth of the Tongan diaspora. Other key members of Tongan kinship are the 'Ulumotu'a or the oldest male in ones extended family on your father's side, they are usually called upon to be in charge of funerals and other family events. They do not out rank a Fahu but they have power to direct events. Also noteworthy [...] is all of your maternal aunts are called your mothers, likewise you paternal uncles are your fathers. Your cousins on either side are called your brothers or sisters. Similarly if you are female and your sisters children are called your children also because you are a mother to them. Same applies if you are a male and your brothers children will refer <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> father.|$|E
