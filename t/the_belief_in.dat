5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> vampires.|$|E
5|$|Lisa remains skeptical {{and asks}} Stephen Jay Gould {{to test a}} sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house {{the next day to}} tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on {{television}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> angels to <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> unicorns and leprechauns. In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions. Appalled with the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household and Lisa is arrested and put on trial for destroying the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J.

Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, pointing out that <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality {{should not be a}} basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{arrived in}} Japan in the mid–6th century Asuka period, and was officially {{adopted in the}} wake of the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after which Buddhist temples began to be constructed. The new {{religion}} and customs fundamentally transformed Japanese society and the arts. Funerary traditions such as cremation and the practice of placing epitaphs in graves were imported from China and Korea. Following the treatment of Buddhist relics, the cremated remains in a glass container were wrapped in a cloth and placed in an outer container. Epitaphs, which recorded the lives of the deceased on silver or bronze rectangular strips, were particularly popular from the latter half of the 7th to the end of the 8th century (late Asuka and Nara period). Four epitaphs and a number of cinerary urns and reliquaries containing bones have been designated as National Treasures. Other archaeological National Treasures from the Buddhist era include ritual items buried in the temple foundations of the Golden Halls of Tōdai-ji and Kōfuku-ji in Nara. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a dark period in 1051; consequently in the late Heian period <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the saving powers of Maitreya or Miroku, the Buddha to be, became widespread. Believers buried scriptures and images to gain merit and to prepare for the coming Buddha. This practice, which continued into the Kamakura period, required the transcription of sutras according to strict ritual protocols, their placement in protective reliquary containers and burial in the earth of sacred mountains, shrines or temples to await the future Buddha. The oldest known sutra mound is that of Fujiwara no Michinaga from 1007 on Mount Kinpu, who buried one lotus sutra and five other sutras that he had written in 998. Its sutra container has been designated as National Treasure.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E
