Some scientists expressed the fear that important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research.

5|$|After the war, Johnson {{returned}} to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. It worked against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> some of his constituents. The relationship {{is believed to have}} led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to the House the next year.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> Hamond {{and some}} other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an {{instruction}} forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked the Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a priest was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.|$|E
50|$|During the Review Board’s {{evaluation}} of Sassoon, Rivers is surprised by Sassoon's insistence that he hasn't changed his mind. As such he still fulfills the qualification {{of mental illness}} that landed him at Craiglockhart. On the other hand, Sassoon did not truly qualify as mentally ill in the first place, and he strongly wishes <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war. When his opinion is needed, he qualifies Sassoon as being fit, and thereby qualified to return to war. Sassoon is seen soon after being injured whilst in a trench and laughing - <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bemused <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> his men. <b>The</b> ambiguity of this scene (as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seriousness of the injury) is only resolved when Rivers reads a letter from him {{after the end of}} hostilities.|$|R

Erdeni Batur's decision to name Sengge as the next ruler of the Dzungar Khanate was based on solely on his belief that Sengge was the ablest of his eight sons. For being the ablest Sengge was given the southern half of the Khanate. The northern half would be split among Erdeni Batur's remaining seven sons. The fourth son, Galdan, transferred his rights to Sengge.|$|R

He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, {{revealing}} that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as {{the body of the}} drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1906, now {{settled into}} a prosperous living, Davidson married Molly Saurin. The Stiffkey rectory became a family home, as {{children}} were born at regular intervals. Notwithstanding his parochial and domestic responsibilities, Davidson quickly adopted the habit of spending much of the week in London, engaged in various kinds of social work. Through his friendship with Reginald Kennedy-Cox, whom he had met at Oxford, Davidson became involved with the Malvern Mission, forerunner of the Dockland Settlements, of which he later became a trustee. He also became chaplain to the Actors' Church Union, based at St Paul's, Covent Garden, and was frequently to be found backstage in London's theatres, ministering {{to the needs of}} showgirls—sometimes with an unwelcomed degree of persistence. Between 1910 and 1913 he expanded this work to Paris, to which he made regular visits, sometimes acting as a chaperone for dancers recruited by the Folies Bergère. Many out-of-work and would-be actresses were invited to stay at the Stiffkey rectory, sometimes as many as 20 at a time, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> Molly Davidson and of some of the local establishment who feared for the morals of local farmhands. Among those most disapproving of Davidson's conduct was Major Philip Hamond, a churchwarden at Morston, who later became Davidson's principal adversary.|$|E

Despite the volumes of research evidence available, relatively little is disseminated and taken up or applied in practice. 1 – 3 These dissemination and uptake problems are neither new nor unique. The literature from many disciplines is replete with examples of new research findings not being widely used in decision making, sometimes for decades or more. 4 5 The problem, however, has been noticed more acutely in the health disciplines in the previous decade with the widespread adoption of “evidence›based ” approaches, and with the ensuing concer...|$|R

By 1802 the Separatists had grown in number to about 12,000 and the Württemberg government decided that they were a dangerous threat to social order. Rapp was summoned to Maulbronn for an interrogation, and the government confiscated Separatist books. When released in 1803, from a brief time in prison, Rapp told his followers to pool their assets and follow him on a journey for safety <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "land of Israel" [...] in the United States, and soon over 800 people were living with him there.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the dish was first prepared for the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I (1830-1916). There are several stories.

50|$|For a time it {{was unclear}} which of the three areas—cabinet, military, and {{civilian}} homefront—would be investigated by whom, and how. On 28 August, Olmert announced {{the creation of a}} governmental inspection probe led by former director of Mossad Nahum Admoni; it became the prototype for the Winograd Commission. A military inspection probe, led by former Chief of Staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak which on 22 August ceased work after five days of operations due to increasing public dissatisfaction and calls for a state commission, was also set to be renewed. Olmert hinted that the State Comptroller would examine <b>the</b> civilian homefront, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public <b>consternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter. In response to these growing criticisms, Olmert chose to replace Admoni with retired judge Eliyahu Winograd as chair of the governmental inspection probe (with Olmert thereby responding to calls that any leading commission or probe needs to be headed by a retired judge); the probe itself, turned into a commission with a wider mandate, amounting to near-equal authority to a state commission.|$|R
