5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> were defeated, the U.N. {{mandated}} that the U.S. withdraw from Iraq, ending the Gulf War. By {{the end of}} combat operations, the 24th Infantry Division advanced 260 miles and destroyed 360 tanks and other armored personnel carriers, 300 artillery pieces, 1,200 trucks, 25 aircraft, 19 missiles, and over 500 pieces of engineer equipment. The division took over 5,000 Iraqi prisoners of war while suffering only eight killed, 36 wounded, and five non-combat casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E

25|$|In August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait. After {{a series}} of failed {{diplomatic}} negotiations, the United States led a coalition to remove <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> from Kuwait, in {{what became known as}} the Gulf War. On 26 February 1991, the coalition succeeded in driving out <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> As they retreated, Iraqi forces carried out a scorched earth policy by setting oil wells on fire. During the Iraqi occupation, more than 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed. In addition, more than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2012, a {{military}} clash between <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> and the Peshmerga resulted in one person killed. CNN reported that 2 {{people were killed}} (one of them an Iraqi soldier) and 10 wounded in clashes at the Tuz Khurmato town.|$|E
25|$|Before the invasion, many {{observers}} had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> quickly (see Shock and awe), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The {{assumption was that}} superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces {{would allow them to}} attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Forces</b> and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army, officially <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Ground <b>Forces,</b> is <b>the</b> ground <b>force</b> {{component}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Armed <b>Forces,</b> having {{been active in}} various incarnations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} truce, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> {{increased}} their <b>force</b> to about 10,000. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> expeditionary <b>force</b> numbered around 18,000 men.|$|R
50|$|The Ground Forces Command at Victory Base Complex near Baghdad Airport is {{the most}} {{important}} fighting formation in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army. <b>The</b> headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Ground <b>Forces</b> Command and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Joint <b>Forces</b> Command are the same entity.|$|R
25|$|When Iraqi forces came to Habbaniya, they {{surrounded}} {{the base and}} gave warning that any military activity would be considered as hostile, leading to an attack. However, the RAF training aircraft took off and bombed <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces,</b> repelling them from the base. Columns were then set out from Habbaniya, Palestine and Basra to capture Baghdad, {{and put an end}} to the coup. They succeeded at relatively low cost, but there was a disturbing development during the campaign.|$|E
25|$|According to Avi Shlaim, in March 1949 as <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew {{and handed}} over their {{positions}} to the Jordanian legion, Israel carried out Operation Shin-Tav-Shin which allowed Israel to renegotiate the cease fire line in the Wadi Ara area of the northern West Bank in a secret agreement that was incorporated into the General Armistice Agreement. The Green Line was redrawn in blue ink on the southern map {{to give the impression}} that a movement in the green line had been made.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, the Iraqi {{government}} {{ordered the}} KRG to transfer its powers over the Peshmerga {{to the central}} government. Relations became further strained by {{the formation of a}} new command center (Tigris Operation Command) for Iraqi forces to operate in a disputed area over which both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government claim jurisdiction. On 16 November 2012 a military clash between <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> and the Peshmerga resulted in one person killed. CNN reported that two people were killed (one of them an Iraqi soldier) and ten wounded in clashes at the Tuz Khurmato town.|$|E
50|$|The first SAMA CH2000s were {{delivered}} to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> 70th Squadron, based in Basrah on 29 October 2004. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> acquired between 8 and 16 aircraft {{at a cost}} of USD$5.8M with deliveries completed by the end of March 2005.|$|R

50|$|With British forces having air superiority, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{army was}} <b>forced</b> back to Fallujah and the RAF {{attacked}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> bases at Mosul and Rashid. Habbaniya had essentially lifted the siege {{with its own}} resources.|$|R
25|$|An Iraqi force {{consisting}} of two infantry and one armoured brigade crossed the Jordan River from northern Jordan, attacking the Israeli settlement of Gesher with little success. Following this defeat, Iraqi forces moved into the strategic triangle bounded by the Arab towns Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm. On 25 May, they were making their way towards Netanya, when they were stopped. On 29 May, an Israeli attack against the Iraqis led to three days of heavy fighting over Jenin, but Iraqi forces managed to hold their positions. After these battles, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> became stationary and their involvement in the war effectively ended.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, Iraqi General Najim al-Jubouri, the {{commander}} of the planned operation to retake Mosul, reported that Iraqi special forces were massing to the north of Baghdad and Baiji, in preparation for the coming battle. Units from the 15th and 16th Divisions of the Iraqi Army, federal police, and Golden Brigade were said to have been dispatched. General al-Jubouri also stated that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> deployed had been trained, and that they will be equipped with advanced weapons when the assault begins. He also said that the operation would be accompanied by an intense Coalition air campaign against ISIL positions in Mosul.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twelfth}} {{day of the}} siege, the outnumbered Rangers {{continued}} to face repeated attacks by the enemy force. The Air National Guard A-10 and F-16 pilots realized early in the battle that the close air support they provided was the vital element that kept <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> at bay, {{a matter of life}} and death for the Rangers. In the end the coalition forces prevailed. Military experts believed that without the air support, especially the A-10s, the Rangers would not have won the battle. Not only did the coalition forces secure the Haditha Dam complex, but they seriously reduced the fighting effectiveness of the Iraqi Armored Task Force in the Haditha area.|$|E

25|$|The Iraqi tank crews used old, cheap steel penetrators {{against the}} {{advanced}} Chobham Armour of these US and British tanks, with disastrous results. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> {{also failed to}} utilize the advantage that could be gained from using urban warfare— fighting within Kuwait City— which could have inflicted significant casualties on the attacking forces. Urban combat reduces the range at which fighting occurs and can negate some of the technological advantage that well equipped forces enjoy. Iraqis also tried to use Soviet military doctrine, but the implementation failed {{due to the lack}} of skill of their commanders and the preventive air strikes of the USAF and RAF on communication centers and bunkers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the dawn}} of July 13, the Iraqi Army, backed by the Shiite and Sunni pro-government militias, {{launched}} an assault on several fronts in Anbar, including on Ramadi. According to the police sources in the province, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> pushed towards Ramadi from {{the west and the}} south. According to ISIL supporters, the advances of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> were repelled by militants. By the afternoon, the Iraqi Army retook the Ramadi Olympic stadium in western Ramadi and reached {{the eastern part of the}} city. According to Iraqi officials, pro-government fighters also pushed the extremists from the areas east of Ramadi. On July 20, the Olympic stadium was destroyed by ISIL militants with remotely detonated explosives. According to military officials said that there may have been number of Shiite militia fighters may have been inside the stadium at the time of its destruction, but they did not offer casualty figures. On July 23, Iraqi government announced that it had deployed United States-trained Iraqi troops for the first time to retake Ramadi. The Shiite militia commanders said that currently the initial main focus was on retaking Fallujah rather than Ramadi and the Iraqi government indicated that will not be used to liberate Ramadi. On July 26, pro-government forces took back the complete control of University of Anbar from ISIL fighters. It was retaken by forces from Iraq's Counter Terrorism Services with support from the Iraqi army and air support from the international coalition and Iraqi aircraft. On July 29, 12 Iraqi soldiers were killed when ISIL suicide attackers rammed 2 explosive-laden Humvees into forces deployed outside the university's compound.|$|E
25|$|Egypt sold Kuwait 110 vehicles.

A report of the secretary general of the United Nations Security Council shows that most of the units that were captured by Iraq were returned to Kuwait as part of the return of property seized by Iraq hand over operations that have taken place from the second of March 1994 to 15 October 1996. A total of forty vehicles have been returned on three phases. See the table above for details. Not all of the vehicles are in active service with the Kuwaiti Army currently.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Iraq's {{army had}} 21,000 men in 12 brigades and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air <b>Force</b> had 100 planes, mostly British.

25|$|The Iranians struck {{south-east}} of Sulaymaniyah {{where they}} easily defeated {{most of the}} Iraqi defenders because Saddam Hussein left them to defend even the most exposed positions. After the Iranians had defeated <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> at the front lines, they advanced quickly. However, the Iraqis launched a counter-attack during the Iranian advance. The Iraqi soldiers involved in the counter-attack were ambushed by the Iranians and most Iraqi troops were slaughtered. Victory {{seemed to be in}} the hands of Iranians as they reached Sulaymaniyah but they failed to capture it. The Iranians also came dangerously close to Iraq's Darbandikhan reservoir. The Iraqis responded by launching 720 chemical artillery rockets and 200 chemical artillery shells which resulted in the Iranian 55th parachute division taking heavy losses and wiping out of the 84th infantry division, forcing the Iranians to call off the offensive.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2012, a {{military}} clash between <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> and the Peshmerga resulted in one person killed.

On the night of November 19, clashes between security forces of the central Iraqi government and the KRG forces in Tigrit left 12 Iraqi soldiers and one civilian dead, according to Doğan news agency. The clash erupted when Iraqi soldiers attempted to enter northern Iraq; peshmargas tried to prevent the Iraqi soldiers from entering the area upon Barzani’s instructions. On November 25, {{it was reported that}} Iraqi Kurdistan sent reinforcements to a disputed area where its troops are involved in a standoff with the Iraqi army, despite calls on both sides for dialogue to calm the situation.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi {{port city}} of Umm Qasr was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into {{unexpectedly}} stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> out. Farther north, the British 7 Armoured Brigade ("The Desert Rats"), fought their way into Iraq's second-largest city, Basra, on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment cleared the 'old quarter' {{of the city that}} was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since World War II when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. A few members of D Squadron, British SAS, were deployed to southern Iraq to support the coalition advance on Basra, the team conducted forward route reconnaissance and infiltrated the city and brought in strikes on the Ba'athist loyalist leadership.|$|E
