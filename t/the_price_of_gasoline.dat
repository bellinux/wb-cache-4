5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol use on {{gasoline}} prices {{is the source}} of conflicting opinion from economic studies, further complicated by the non-market forces of tax credits, met and unmet government quotas, and the dramatic recent increase in domestic oil production. [...] According to a 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis, ethanol, and biofuel in general, does not materially influence <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline,</b> while a runup in the price of government mandated Renewable Identification Number credits has driven up <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline.</b> [...] These in contrast to a May, 2012, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development study which showed a $0.29 to $1.09 reduction in per gallon gasoline price from ethanol use.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the late}} 19 th century, the mean {{temperature}} on earth has increased with 0.8 °C {{and the major}} part of this increase is likely due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide {{is the type of}} greenhouse gas with largest emission and this originates from the combustion of fossil fuels as coal, oil and natural gas (Sun and Cheng 2002). In USA, transportation accounts for 30 % of the total energy consumption. Burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil releases CO 2, which is a major cause of global warming. With only 4.5 % of the world’s population, the US is responsible for about 25 % of global energy consumption and 25 % of global CO 2 emissions. <b>The</b> average <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> in 2005 was $ 2.56 per gallon, which was $ 0.67 higher than <b>the</b> average <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> in <b>the</b> previous year.

50|$|The private {{corporations}} {{contended that}} their profits {{after the collapse}} of the Argentine economy were severely hurt by the freezing of domestic and industrial fees since 2002. Natural gas remained at <b>the</b> same <b>price</b> during <b>the</b> inflationary process caused by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, while <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> and diesel were adjusted upwards, which increased the demand for gas as a cheap alternative fuel and at the same time discouraged its production. In addition to this, a larger part of the supply of natural gas was required to compensate for a smaller yield of hydroelectricity.|$|R
2500|$|... the United States was {{producing}} {{in excess of}} 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories and fast food restaurants. [...] If all those 11 billion liters could be recycled and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset. Use of used vegetable oil as a direct fuel competes with some other uses of the commodity, which has effects on its price as a fuel and increases its cost as an input to the other uses as well. Utilizing recycled vegetable oil {{as a replacement for}} standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> by preserving the supply of petroleum. If demand was relegated towards alternative fuels like biofuels, it would reduce the demand for petroleum and subsequently reduce <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When the {{government}} announced on 4 May that it would increase <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> by 70 percent and triple the price of electricity, campus groups reacted. More than 500 students gathered at the State Institute of Teacher Training and Education ( [...] , IKIP Negeri). Security forces barricaded the campus to prevent students from leaving and allegedly threw Molotov bombs at demonstrators through the day. Although the students had dispersed by late afternoon, replacement forces were brought in to keep them on campus through the night. When {{they were allowed to}} return home hours later, police reportedly stopped a group of students and assaulted them. Word of this attack spread through several witnesses, and a large group later attacked and destroyed a traffic police post. As the outnumbered police fled, protesters began attacking shopping malls and another police post. Thousands poured into the streets and burned cars and shops through the late night.|$|E
2500|$|Investment banks, {{including}} Goldman, {{have also}} been accused of driving up <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> by speculating on the oil futures exchange. In August 2011, [...] "confidential documents" [...] were leaked [...] "detailing the positions" [...] in the oil futures market of several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays, just before the peak in gasoline prices {{in the summer of}} 2008. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant {{for the fact that the}} banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. Journalist Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones called it [...] "a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude". However, another source stated that [...] "Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world's largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data...." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Giant Eagle {{introduced}} the [...] "Advantage Card", an electronic loyalty card discount system (already popular in many chains), as a sophisticated {{version of the}} obsolete stamp programs. The card was later modified to double as a video rental card for Iggle Video. [...] More recently the company has started the Fuelperks! program to entice customers. [...] This program allows customer the opportunity to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas (20 cents in select markets) with fifty dollars worth of authorized purchases. In early 2009, Giant Eagle launched the Foodperks! program, mainly geared towards GetGo. This program allows customers who use their fuelperks at GetGo to also earn foodperks to save on groceries purchased at Giant Eagle. Every 10 gallons of gas purchased earns a 1% discount. This can be used up to 20% maximum at a time on a purchase of up to $300. Foodperks are good for 90 days and fuelperks are good for 60 days. If the customer has more than <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> or more than the 20%, those discounts will stay on their card {{for the remainder of}} the 90/60 days, and if they are not used by then, they expire. In February 2013, Giant Eagle announced that they would be discontinuing the Foodperks! program that month because it was [...] "a little too complex".|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E
