40|$|In {{the absence}} of taxes and {{transactions}} costs, {{there can be no}} benefit to corporate reorganization from a financial standpoint, but ‘real world ’ limitations and frictions do provide additional value that is gained through divestitures in terms of focus and financial flexibility. Herein, the corporate divestiture decision is analyzed to determine the motivation for a parent company either to cleave its offspring directly to the external capital market in an equity carve-out or to distribute the shares to the existing shareholders in a <b>tax-free</b> <b>spin-off.</b> Cash flow performance, asymmetric information, relative size of the divestiture, and relatedness of the parent’s and subsidiary’s operations are all found to contribute significantly to the divestiture decision. In Canada, an alternate form of security, known as the income trust unit, has become popular for corporate reorganizations, either through an initial public offering or as a conversion of shares. The flow-through structure of income trusts currently allows avoidance of corporate taxation to offer higher pre-tax returns to retail investors, in a market setting where yield is increasingly equated with value. To determine placement of these securities in the market, the risk of the income trust organizational form is analyzed and compared to the standard corporate form. Further, a number of publicly known characteristics of the income trusts can predict the relative risk of this type of investment. In recent ‘hot markets ’ for these securities, proof is uncovered that unsuitable firms have been migrating to this sector, but valuation of the investments in this sector has remained fair and full. Although pending legislation will discontinue the tax-exempt status of income trusts in 2011, during their tenure these securities have improved the Canadian market. Based on the data analysis herein, all types of i divestitures studied have been predicted to provide commensurate value with respect to risk depending {{on the nature of the}} subsidiary. i...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, merger and {{acquisition}} activity {{has captured the}} corporate headlines, reaffirming the popular view that bigger is better. Yet the benefits of such empire building are belied by evidence that corporate spin-offs generally add more value to a business or group of businesses. Indeed, the advantages of spin-offs have not been lost {{on some of the}} more astute corporate executives, and although mergers {{and acquisition}}s may make better copy, spin-offs have been quietly on the rise. Companies such as AT 2 ̆ 6 T, General Motors, ITT, Sprint, Dun and Bradstreet, and Sears have successfully reaped the benefits of performing tax-free spin-offs pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C. or Code) § 355, the principle means of effecting them. The largest benefit of a spin-off is that I. R. C. § 355 creates a tax-free shelter under which no gain or loss is recognized by either the distributing corporation or the shareholders receiving the distribution, thus eliminating the double taxation which otherwise would be incurred. Section 355 and the applicable Treasury Regulations (Regulations), however, establish several requirements that must be met before a spin-off will qualify as tax-free. These requirements demonstrate that the IRS disfavors spin-offs. The main thrust of the requirements is to prevent spin-offs from being used as devices for extracting earnings and profits tax-free or at capital gain rates. For example, a primary hurdle to a <b>tax-free</b> <b>spin-off</b> is the business purpose test, a subjective test requiring that the spin-off be motivated by a real and substantial non-federal tax purpose germane to the business of the parent corporation, subsidiary, or affiliated group to which the corporation belongs. The IRS uses the subjectivity of the business purpose test as a filtering mechanism to disqualify many corporations that would otherwise fulfill the requirements for a valid spin-off. There are numerous reasons why a corporation might want to pursue a spin-off, all of them real and substantial and having nothing to do with federal taxation. For example, many corporations have found that spin-offs unlock value in their businesses, thereby rewarding shareholders. Other legitimate reasons for spin-offs include facilitating acquisitions, enhancing earnings from stock offerings, increasing management accountability, sharpening corporate fitness and focus, and increasing efficiency. In some circumstances, avoiding liability and providing takeover defenses may be appropriate justifications for spin-offs. In circumstances where these are not appropriate justifications, safeguards against entrenchment and state fraudulent conveyance laws have proven to be adequate deterrents to abuse. All of the above legitimate, non-tax rationales ultimately serve to enhance shareholder value and are therefore consistent with directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 fiduciary duty to their shareholders-namely, to maximize value. The current tax law, however, ignores this duty and often frustrates it. This Article proposes that I. R. C. § 355 and the accompanying regulations should be revised to facilitate rather than hinder corporate spin-offs. Part I reviews the history of the tax treatment of spin-offs and outlines the section 355 provisions, treasury regulations, and revenue rulings that currently govern spin-offs. Part II considers some improper motives for spin-offs, but argues that legal safeguards against entrenchment and state fraudulent conveyance laws adequately address abusive spin-offs. Part II examines the legitimate, non-tax rationales behind spin-offs within the context of management 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value. Finally, Part IV analyzes the reasons why the tax law should encourage spin-offs and suggests revisions to section 355 to facilitate them.
