5|$|The system {{currently}} uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside {{signals and}} automatic train stops {{in order to}} provide safe <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening, and many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an automatic <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E

2500|$|The {{division}} was activated again at George in 1980, replacing Tactical Training, George, {{which had been}} the headquarters for George's <b>training</b> <b>operations.</b> [...] A {{few months after the}} division's activation, F-4 <b>training</b> <b>operations</b> were split, with one wing using F-4Es to train United States and foreign fighter aircrews and the other flying F-4Gs to train Wild Weasel crews. [...] In 1989, it was announced that George would be closing. [...] <b>Training</b> <b>operations</b> were consolidated into a single wing and the {{division was}} inactivated in 1991 as operations at George were reduced.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, the MTA {{has plans}} to {{automate}} a much larger portion, using One Person <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed {{at a cost of}} $20 billion. The Flushing line operated at almost 30 trains an hour using the signal system installed when the line was built, but after CBTC is installed it is possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated.|$|E
5|$|Kumba {{features}} four {{steel and}} fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be on the track at any one time, meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three <b>train</b> <b>operation,</b> the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.|$|E
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E

5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. This enables the AirTrain to use automatic <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> without drivers.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} no passenger <b>train</b> <b>operation</b> in Teaneck, train service is available across the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge and at the Anderson Street station in Hackensack. NJTransit's Pascack Valley Line runs north-south to Hoboken Terminal, with connections to the PATH train from the Hoboken PATH station, and with NJT connecting service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via the Secaucus Junction transfer station. At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson River in Hudson County).|$|E
5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of Unattended <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> (UTO). Additional 258 Broad gauge (BG) coaches for Line 1 to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains). Barring a few 4-car trains on Line 5, 93% of the trains would operate either in 6 car or 8 car configuration at the end of Phase III.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015, the {{president}} of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015–2019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, {{with the exception of}} Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Operation</b> systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D is also te receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.|$|E

25|$|Waterloo & City line – The {{line was}} {{upgraded}} with five new 1992-stock trains {{in the early}} 1990s, {{at the same time}} as the Central line was upgraded. The line operates under traditional signalling and does not use Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Operation.</b> The line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new signaling system to allow Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Operation.</b> The line is predicted to run 30 trains per hour, up to a 50% increase compared to the current 21-trains-per-hour service. The line may also be one of the first to be upgraded, alongside the Piccadilly line, with new trains, systems and platform-edge doors to test the systems before the Central and Bakerloo lines are upgraded.|$|E
