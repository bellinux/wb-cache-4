25|$|Delegates {{discussed}} the capitalist economic crisis, imperialist intervention and war globally, environmental crisis and climate change, {{the intensification of}} the attack on organized labour, youth unemployment/underemployment and precarious work, poverty wages, ableism, xenophobia and racism, the ongoing genocidal attack on Indigenous peoples, sexism, <b>transphobia</b> and homophobia, and the struggle for free, accessible, quality public education at all-levels. Throughout this analysis it was made clear that what connects these struggles is their relation to the struggle against capitalism, and particularly the struggle against monopoly capital and their governments. At the Pan-Canadian level this means the struggle against the Harper Conservative government which represents a consolidation of the anti-social offensive of capital.|$|E
25|$|A {{review was}} {{announced}} on 26 February 2016, after forty-three Coalition backbenchers including former leader Tony Abbott {{had signed a}} petition calling for the program's closure. The review did not consider {{the contents of the}} Minus 18 website, or the contents of the network partnersâ€™ websites. The review did not find that any of the official resources were inappropriate. It found that the content in guideline documents was consistent with the aims of the program and that the language and content was suitable. All lesson plans were found to be consistent with the aims of the program as were all the posters. No harm was expected to come from primary schools students viewing the material, just that they may not comprehend some terms such as <b>transphobia</b> or homophobia. The level of interaction between schools and parents was found to be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May 2006, {{when the}} march was {{intended}} to have been held, the Applicant along with several others attended a conference in honour of the International Day Against Homophobia and <b>Transphobia,</b> which had been on 17 May.

500|$|In July 2005, former CBS {{reporter}} Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in {{his book}} 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that [...] "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left." [...] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation [...] "is an act, a put-on." [...] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, <b>transphobia,</b> and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{discussed the}} more complex psychological causes of Brandon's murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether {{it was due to}} <b>transphobia</b> or homophobia: [...] "Ultimately in Boys , the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage." [...] Ebert called the film a [...] "sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame".|$|E
500|$|A {{belief in}} [...] "lesbian & gay separatism" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the related [...] "lesbian separatism"), holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere. While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBT community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of nonmonosexual orientations and of transsexuality. This can extend to public biphobia and <b>transphobia.</b> In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be [...] "political madness", stating that [...] "Queers are, like transgender people, gender deviant. We donâ€™t conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour, in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex. We should celebrate our discordance with mainstream straight norms." ...|$|E

2500|$|This framework, it {{is argued}} by its proponents, {{can be used to}} {{understand}} systemic injustice and social inequality in many ways. Proponents claim that racism, sexism, classism, ableism, homophobia, <b>transphobia,</b> xenophobia, and religious or other belief-based bigotry and persecutionâ€”do not act independently of each other. Instead, these forms of oppression interrelate, creating a system of oppression that reflects the [...] "intersection" [...] of multiple forms of discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Chile's Congress {{approved}} [...] "The Law about School Violence" [...] that {{amended the}} General Law of Education to establish definitions, procedures, and penalties for school violence and bullying.

2500|$|Biphobia is a {{portmanteau}} word patterned on {{the term}} homophobia. It {{derives from the}} English neo-classical prefix bi- (meaning [...] "two") from bisexual and the root -phobia (from the , phÃ³bos, [...] "fear") found in homophobia. Along with <b>transphobia</b> and homophobia, {{it is one of}} a family of terms used to describe intolerance and discrimination against LGBT people. The adjectival form biphobic describes things or qualities related to biphobia, and the less-common noun biphobe is a label for people thought to harbor biphobia.|$|E

They are not just homophobic if they do that â€” they are actually Godophobic because God loves every one of those people." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights of France, Yade {{met with}} several LGBT {{organizations}} on the International Day Against Homophobia and <b>Transphobia</b> in 2008 and {{announced to the}} organizations that henceforth the government officially recognized that day. She announced that she would appeal to the United Nations for the universal decriminalization of homosexuality, and asked, [...] "How can we tolerate {{the fact that people}} are stoned, hanged, decapitated and tortured only because of their sexual orientation?" [...] When asked about the issue of same-sex marriage in 2009, she replied that it was not up to her to settle the question for society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the United Nations to {{recognise}} LGBT rights as human rights is condemned, despite the case law [...] "Toonen v.

And at last, the Declaration calls on all nations in the world and United Nations to recognize an promote the 17 May of each year as the International Day Against Homophobia and <b>Transphobia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 2006, Butler {{participated in}} a faculty-organized {{teach-in}} against the 2006 Lebanon War at the University of California, Berkeley. Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. She cited racist comments {{on the part of}} organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, she went on to name several groups that she commended as stronger opponents of [...] "homophobia, <b>transphobia,</b> sexism, racism, and militarism".|$|E
2500|$|Reacting {{to these}} sentiments, the New Statesman commented that [...] "a vote for Wurst is another vote against Russian {{homophobia}} and <b>transphobia,</b> and a win would {{send out a}} strong message of defiance eastwards", while the International Business Times called on readers to vote for Wurst to upset homophobes. Highlighting statements such as these as evidence, Spiked declared that many Western European commentators and politicos had adopted Wurst as [...] "a symbol of everything that makes Western Europe superior to the East" [...] {{and that she had}} thus become part of a culture war against both Russia and [...] "the so-called bigots and backward types" [...] in their own nations.|$|E
2500|$|As well, the hip hop music {{community}} {{has been criticized for}} its homophobia and <b>transphobia.</b> Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term [...] "faggot") and sometimes violent threats towards queer people, such as rapper DMX's [...] "Where the Hood At," [...] rapper Eazy-E's [...] "Nobody Move," [...] rap group Brand Nubian's [...] "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down". Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or <b>transphobia.</b> These artists include Ja Rule, who in an interview claimed,"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's talk about all these fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids canâ€™t watch this shit," [...] and rap artist Erick Sermon, who has said publicly," [...] will never accept transgender rappers." [...] Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in. Despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. One of the more notable members of the LGBT community in hip hop is Frank Ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two Grammy Awards. Other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper Azealia Banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer Angel Haze, lesbian rapper Siya, and genderqueer rapper Mykki Blanco.|$|E

She {{made it clear that}} she was never a man, that her validity as a woman doesn't come from anyone except herself. The post drew more than 100 comments in support and against her claims.|$|E
