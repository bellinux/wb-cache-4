6000|$|Toward {{the close}} of 1859, Darwin's [...] "Origin of Species" [...] was published. It raised a great outcry in England; and Huxley {{immediately}} came forward as chief defender of the faith therein set forth. He took part in debates on this subject, {{the most famous of}} which was the one between himself and Bishop Wilberforce at Oxford. The Bishop concluded his speech by turning to Huxley and asking, [...] "Was it through his grandfather or grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey?" [...] Huxley, as is reported by an eye-witness, [...] "slowly and deliberately arose. A slight tall figure, stern and pale, very quiet and grave, he stood before us and spoke those tremendous words. [...] . He was not ashamed to have a monkey for an ancestor; but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth." [...] Another story indicates the temper of that time. Carlyle, whose writing had strongly influenced Huxley, and whom Huxley had come to know, could not forgive him for his attitude toward evolution. One day, years after the publication of Man's Place in Nature, Huxley, seeing Carlyle {{on the other side of}} the street, a broken, pathetic figure, walked over and spoke to him. The old man merely remarked, [...] "You're Huxley, aren't you? the man <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>we</b> are all descended from monkeys," [...] and passed on. Huxley, however, saw nothing degrading to man's dignity in the theory of evolution. In a wonderfully fine sentence he gives his own estimate of the theory as it affects man's future on earth. [...] "Thoughtful men once escaped from the blinding influences of traditional prejudices, will find in the lowly stock whence man has sprung the best evidence of the splendour of his capacities; and will discover, in his long progress through the past, a reasonable ground of faith in his attainment of a nobler future." [...] As a result of all these controversies on The Origin of Species and of investigations to uphold Darwin's theory, Huxley wrote his first book, already mentioned, Man's Place in Nature.|$|E

The productivity turnaround from labour-shedding {{proved to be}} a one-off, and was not matched by growth in output. The industrial base was so reduced that thereafter the balance of payments in manufactured goods was in deficit. Chancellor Nigel Lawson told the House of Lords Select Committee on Overseas Trade: [...] "There is no adamantine law <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>we</b> have to produce as {{much in the way of}} manufactures as we consume.

Salon then published a response with changes made to the original text and addressing some, but not all of the concerns raised by the Ahmansons. Ahmanson has supported certain organizations of the ex-gay movement in that they regard homosexuality as a condition to be dealt with similarly to alcoholism and drug addiction. In 2008, Ahmanson's company, Fieldstead and Company, contributed $1,395,000 to the [...] "YES on 8" [...] campaign according to the Los Angeles Times [...] "Follow the donors" [...] page.

40|$|Abstract This article {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} political trust, ideology, and public support for tax cutting. Conceptualizing tax cuts as government action under conditions of risk, I argue that political trust should increase rather than decrease public support for tax cutting, partic-ularly among those for whom endorsement of tax cuts entails ideological sacrifice. The results show that political trust increases support for a va-riety of tax cut initiatives, but only among liberals. The results further suggest that trust is an instrumental resource that can bolster support for a conservative {{as well as a}} liberal policy agenda. This bill is more than just tax relief. It is more than just preventing Washington from growing the size of government. This bill reflects a philosophy <b>that</b> <b>says,</b> <b>we</b> trust the American people more than we trust government –George W. Bush, June 4, 2001, Office of the Press Secretary Throughout the 2000 campaign and the early months of his presidency, George W.
