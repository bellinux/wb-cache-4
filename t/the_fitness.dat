40|$|<b>The</b> {{commonly}} adopted <b>fitness</b> which evaluates <b>the</b> {{performance of}} individuals in co-evolutionary systems is <b>the</b> relative <b>fitness.</b> <b>The</b> relative <b>fitness</b> measure is a dynamic assessment subject to co-evolving population(s). Researchers apparently pay {{little attention to the}} use of absolute fitness functions in studying co-evolutionary algorithms. The first aim of this work is to define both <b>the</b> relative <b>fitness</b> and <b>the</b> absolute <b>fitness</b> for co-evolving systems. Another aim is to demonstrate the usage of the absolute and relative fitness through two case studies. One is for the Iterated Prisoners’ Dilemma. Another case is for solving the Basic Alternating-Offers Bargaining Problem, for which a co-evolutionary system has been developed by means of Genetic Programming. Experiments using <b>the</b> relative <b>fitness</b> function have discovered co-adapted strategies that converge to nearly game-theoretic solutions. This finding suggests that <b>the</b> relative <b>fitness</b> essentially drives co-evolution to perfect equilibrium. On the other hand, <b>the</b> absolute <b>fitness</b> measuring co-evolving populations monitors the development of co-adaptation. Having analyzed the micro-behavior of the players’ strategies based on their absolute fitness, we can explain how co-evolving populations stabilize at the perfect equilibrium...|$|R

5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E

5|$|The role of {{cleaning}} symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> of both individuals. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} parasitism.|$|E

5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

On 13 June 1263, Albin, Roger, Bishop of Ross, and Richard de Inverkeithing, Bishop of Dunkeld, were selected by the papacy to judge <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> and, if appropriate, consecrate Walter de Baltrodin as Bishop of Caithness.|$|E

Guthy-Renker partnered with National Media Corp. to help market some of its fitness products, {{which led to a}} legal dispute that was settled with undisclosed terms in 1997.

5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>the</b> Objective <b>Fitness</b> Correlation, a {{new tool}} {{to analyze the}} evaluation accuracy of coevolutionary algorithms. Accurate evaluation is an essential ingredient in creating adequate coevolutionary dynamics.

The correlation between <b>the</b> objective <b>fitness</b> and <b>the</b> subjective <b>fitness</b> used in a coevolutionary algorithm yields <b>the</b> Objective <b>Fitness</b> Correlation. <b>The</b> OFC measure is applied to three coevolutionary evaluation methods. It is found that <b>the</b> Objective <b>Fitness</b> Correlation varies substantially over time. Moreover, a high OFC is found to correspond to periods where the algorithm is able to increase the objective quality of individuals. This is evidence of the utility of OFC as a measure to evaluate and compare coevolutionary evaluation mechanisms. <b>The</b> Objective <b>Fitness</b> Correlation (OFC) provides a precise analytical tool to measure the accuracy of evaluation in coevolutionary algorithms...|$|R

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on <b>the</b> <b>fitness</b> of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
