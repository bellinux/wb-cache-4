60|$|Miss Vickers {{dropped the}} brush in the pail, and, rising slowly to her feet, stood wiping {{her hands on}} her coarse apron. Her face was red and white in patches, and the captain, {{regarding}} her with growing uneasiness, began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the vessels}} were under way again {{it was found that}} the lugger was obliged to lower her main-sail to keep in her {{position}} astern of the Sea-horse, while the brig was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail</b> after sail until the whole of the upper sails had been furled.|$|E
60|$|The mate said nothing, but {{stood by}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail</b> {{as they ran}} swiftly toward the little quay. The pace slackened, and the Arabella, as though {{conscious}} of the contraband in her forecastle, crept slowly to where a stout, middle-aged woman, who bore a strong likeness to the mate, stood upon the quay.|$|E

6000|$|... "Clear the anchor, {{and stand}} by to let go!" [...] cried the captain, in loud sharp tones, for {{he felt that}} there was no room to turn and retreat. The order was also given <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{changed my}} course at once; bore {{straight}} down on her, an' soon overhauled her, but the nearer I came the more did my courage run out, so I gradooally begun <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail</b> an drop astarn. At last I got savage, `You're a fool, Jenkins!' says I to myself. `That's a fact!' says su'thin' inside o' me.|$|E
6000|$|... “That is so,” Will agreed; “but on {{the other}} hand, if the wind becomes much {{stronger}} we’ll have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail,</b> {{and in that case}} we should have more chance of escaping notice if we come near any of those Moorish craft. Besides, if the sea were really rough {{it would be difficult for}} them to board us even if they did come up with us.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are right, Mr. Probert. I glanced at the glass, as I came up, and it has fallen half an inch since I was up on deck in the middle watch. I think you had better begin <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail,</b> at once. Call the watch up from below. It is not coming yet; but we may as well strip her, at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I say so?" [...] {{he exclaimed}} in some excitement, {{as he ran}} to the cabin {{skylight}} and glanced earnestly at the barometer. That glance caused him to shout a sudden order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail.</b> At the same moment a sigh of wind swept over the sleeping sea as if the storm-fiend were expressing regret at having been so promptly discovered and met.|$|R
6000|$|Will {{looked in}} the {{direction}} in which the mate pointed, and saw a bank of black clouds rising on the horizon. At the same moment the captain's voice was heard below shouting--"Stand by there to reef topsails!" [...] This was followed by the command to close-reef. Then, as the squall drew rapidly nearer, a hurried order was giving <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail.</b> The squall was evidently a worse one than had at first been expected.|$|R

6000|$|I confess I thought so, too; but I ran on abreast, {{watching}} {{to see if the}} line of breakers from one side the entrance did not overlap the line from the other side. Sure enough, it did. A narrow place where the sea ran smooth appeared. [...] Charmian put down the wheel and steadied for the entrance. Martin threw on the engine, while all hands and the cook sprang <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Twas {{not without}} some reason, for the wind [...] Increased at night, until it blew a gale; [...] And though 'twas not much to a naval mind, [...] Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale, [...] For sailors are, in fact, a {{different}} kind; [...] At sunset they began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail,</b> [...] For the sky show'd it would come on to blow, [...] And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More than we want," [...] {{the captain}} replied, shortly; and then, to my astonishment, ordered the crew aloft <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b> The {{execution}} of this maneuver showed but too plainly the temper of the men; {{they did their}} work sulkily and slowly, grumbling and murmuring among themselves. The captain's manner, as he urged them on with oaths and threats, convinced me we were in danger. I looked again to windward. The one little cloud had enlarged to a great bank of murky vapor, and the sea at the horizon had changed in color.|$|E

60|$|Well-built ships, however, are {{not always}} able to {{withstand}} the violence of rotatory storms. Instances occur in which the tightest built and best manned ships are destroyed as suddenly as the clumsiest of ill-managed junks. Not many years ago, a vessel was proceeding prosperously on her voyage, when signs of a coming tempest induced the wary captain to reduce, and, finally, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail.</b> But his precautions were in vain. The storm burst on the devoted ship, {{and in a few}} minutes the masts went over the side, and the hull lay a total wreck upon the sea.|$|R
60|$|The boys went on, Rollo rowing, and Jonas {{paddling}} behind, {{until at}} length Rollo got tired. Jonas then {{told him to}} spread the umbrella, and hold it up for a sail. Rollo did so. The wind was blowing pretty nearly in {{the direction in which}} they were going, and, by its impulse upon the umbrella, it caused it to pull very hard. Rollo rested the middle of the handle of the umbrella upon his shoulder, holding the crook in his hand, turning it in such a position as to present the open part of the umbrella fairly to the wind. Jonas continued to paddle, and so they went on very prosperously until they had got two thirds across the pond, when Jonas ordered Rollo <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} sail was reduced. Soon after that clouds began to rise on the horizon and spread over the sky. Before half an hour had passed the breeze came--came far {{stronger}} than had been expected--and the order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail</b> had to be repeated. Baker was first again. He was closely followed by Joe Davis and Jim Croft, both of them sturdy fellows--good specimens of the British seaman. Davy Butts, who came next, was not so good a specimen. He was nearly six feet high, very thin and loosely put together, {{like a piece of}} bad furniture. But his bones were big, and he was stronger than he looked. He would not have formed one of such a crew had he not been a good man. The rest of the crew, of whom there were eighteen, not including the officers, were of all shapes, sizes, and complexions.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} the voyage went {{otherwise}} well. They weathered Fakarava with one board; {{and the wind}} holding well to the southward, and blowing fresh, they passed between Ranaka and Ratiu, and ran some days north-east by east-half-east under the lee of Takume and Honden, neither of which they made. In about 14° south, and between 134° and 135° west, it fell a dead calm, with rather a heavy sea. The captain refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail,</b> the helm was lashed, no watch was set, and the Farallone rolled and banged for three days, according to observation, in almost the same place. The fourth morning, a little before day, a breeze sprang up and rapidly freshened. The captain had drunk hard the night before; he was far from sober when he was roused; {{and when he came}} on deck {{for the first time at}} half-past eight, it was plain he had already drunk deep again at breakfast. Herrick avoided his eye; and resigned the deck with indignation to a man more than half-seas-over.|$|E
2500|$|The {{course was}} again changed for this edition, this time {{spanning}} five legs: Newport, Rhode Island/New York — Brixham, Devon — Cape Town — Tauranga — Salvador, Brazil — Newport. [...] Although the race technically started {{and ended in}} Newport, it was preceded by a [...] "prologue race", in which the boats with crews of up to five raced to New York, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part <b>in</b> <b>Sail</b> for America, a major sailing event marking {{the first anniversary of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. [...] The main Around Alone event started from New York, and finished back in Newport.|$|R
60|$|The consternation is {{increased}} when the gale comes on suddenly in a squall, {{so that there}} is not time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>sails</b> <b>in</b> in season. In such a case the sails are often blown away or torn into pieces--the remnants of them, and the ends of the rigging, flapping in the wind with a sound louder than thunder.|$|R
6000|$|In {{less than}} an hour the Roving Bess was running at the rate of twelve knots, under close-reefed top-sails, before a steady gale, which in half-an-hour later {{increased}} to a hurricane, compelling them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail</b> and [...] "lay to." [...] The sun set in a blaze of mingled black and lurid clouds, as if the heavens were on fire; the billows rose to their utmost height as the shrieking winds heaved them upwards, and then, cutting off their crests, hurled the spray along like driving clouds of snow, and dashed it against the labouring ship, as if impatient to engulf her in that ravening maw which has already swallowed up so many human victims.|$|R
60|$|After great delay, {{considering}} {{the importance of}} every day at this time of year, a miserable boat and five men were found, and with some difficulty I stowed away in it such baggage as it was absolutely necessary for me to take, leaving scarcely sitting or sleeping room. The sailing qualities of the boat were highly vaunted, and I was assured that at this season a small one was much more likely to succeed in making the journey. We first coasted along the island, reaching its eastern extremity the following morning (April 11th), and found a strong W. S.W. wind blowing, which just allowed us to lay across to the Matabello Islands, a distance little short of twenty miles. I did not much like the look of the heavy sky and rather rough sea, and my men were very unwilling to make the attempt; but as we could scarcely hope for a better chance, I insisted upon trying. The pitching and jerking of our little boat, soon reduced me to a state of miserable helplessness, and I lay down, resigned to whatever might happen. After three or four hours, I was told we were nearly over; but when I got up, two hours later, just as the sun was setting, I found we were still a good distance from the point, owing to a strong current which had been for some time against us. Night closed in, and the wind drew more ahead, so we had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b> Then came a calm, and we rowed and sailed as occasion offered; and it was four in the morning when we reached the village of Kisslwoi, not having made more than three miles in the last twelve hours.|$|E
60|$|While {{the ship}} was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment, {{starting}} up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He would say nothing else--repeating his cry impatiently, back water! black water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but {{by this time the}} ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b> In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. I was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain, however, treated me with every attention--to make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure.|$|E
6000|$|All sail was now put {{upon the}} brig, and she {{continued}} her original course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition, in which, {{from all that}} could be understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No {{attention was paid to}} Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook. His situation was {{still one of the most}} precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself. His anxiety on my account be represented, however, as the most distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b> During the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet lashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again [...] "until the brig was no longer a brig." [...] This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, Mr. Marble," [...] I said, {{after my}} mates and myself {{had taken a}} long and {{thoughtful}} look at the actual state of things--"On the whole, Mr. Marble, it may be well <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> our light <b>sails,</b> haul our wind, and let the man-of-war come up with us. We are honest folk, {{and there is little}} risk in his seeing all we have to show him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's nothin'," [...] {{said the}} boy, contemptuously, [...] "for this boat I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>in</b> can <b>sail</b> more'n {{four times as}} fast as any steamer you ever saw. Why, she sailed right around Tom Stevens's boat the other day, an' there wasn't any wind at all. I tell you what it is, just you come up here with me an' see her, then you'll know what she can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} stayed before till the crew were paid off; but {{no sooner had}} we cast anchor {{than one of the}} owners came on board, and told the captain that another cargo was ready, that the ship was to be {{unloaded}} with all speed, and <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> cargo and <b>sail</b> again <b>in</b> a fortnight at the utmost, as a fleet was on the point of sailing for the West Indies under a strong convoy." ...|$|R
50|$|The first Ljungström rig was {{developed}} by the Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström to enhance safety at sea. The family had been close to severe accidents with the traditionally rigged Ebella, nowadays named Beatrice Aurore, when in hard weather the crew had to walk on deck <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>sail.</b> Ljungström, in order to not risk the safety of his crew, designed a boomless rig handled completely from the cockpit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I now set {{myself to}} work to do what I thought {{ought to be done}} under the circumstances, but, of course, that wasn't very much. I hoisted a flag upside down, and after {{considering}} the matter I concluded <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all the <b>sails</b> that had been set. I thought that a steamer without smoke coming from her funnel, and no sails set, {{would be more likely to}} attract attention from distant vessels than if she appeared to be under sail.|$|R
500|$|The {{flotilla}} departed Port Jackson on 15 October, proceeding southward {{down the}} New South Wales coastline towards Bass Strait. Cape Howe was passed without incident, though the schooner Francis {{struggled with the}} ocean swell and continually fell behind the larger vessels. The weather slowly worsened until on sunset of 18 October the flotilla encountered a heavy gale. Captain William Kent of Buffalo signaled for the flotilla <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> their <b>sails</b> and ride out the storm; on the following morning the crew of Integrity discovered that they had lost sight of all three other vessels and were running dangerously close to a lee shore. Houstoun elected to continue southward close to land, preferring the risk of running aground to that of braving the gale in deeper water. There was a glimpse of Buffalo far to the east {{on the morning of}} 21 October, [...] "laboring much and lurching very deep" [...] among the waves. Other than this sighting Integrity continued her voyage alone through the storm, crossing Bass Strait into clearer weather on around 23 October. The cutter was brought into an uninhabited bay on the northeast coast of Van Diemen's Land where she underwent basic repairs.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{continuing}} fair, {{the three}} vessels made good {{progress in the}} direction of the Canaries; Sunday, in particular, proving a propitious day, the expedition making more than one hundred and twenty miles in the course of the twenty-four hours. The wind still continued favorable, and on the morning of Monday, the 6th of August, Columbus was cheerfully conversing with Luis, and one or two other companions who were standing near him on the poop, when the Pinta was seen suddenly <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> her forward <b>sails,</b> and to come up briskly, not to say awkwardly, to the wind. This manoeuvre denoted some accident, and the Santa Maria fortunately having the advantage of the wind, immediately edged away to speak her consort.|$|R
6000|$|Should the gale increase, a reef is <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> the main-sail. One, two, three, and {{sometimes}} four reefs are <b>taken</b> <b>in,</b> according <b>to</b> {{the violence of}} the storm; when the last reef is <b>taken</b> <b>in,</b> the sloop is under close-reefed main-sail. Increased violence in the storm necessitates the taking in of the main-sail and lying-to under the fore-sail, or a part of it. Lying-to is putting the sloop's head to the wind, and placing the helm in such a position that it tends to turn the vessel in one direction, while the gale acting on the fore-sail tends to force it in another, and thus it remains stationary between the two opposing forces. Many vessels thus lie-to, and ride out the severest storm. Sometimes, however, a dreadful hurricane arises, and compels vessels <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sails</b> and [...] "scud under bare poles"--that is, drive before the wind without any sails at all; and it is at such seasons that man is forced to feel his utter helplessness, and his absolute dependence on the Almighty. Of course, there are slight variations in the rig of sloops--some have a square-sail, and some have a flying-jib; but these are not distinctive sails, and they are seldom used in small craft.|$|R
6000|$|Toward noon {{the wind}} began to blow harder, {{and the waves}} ran very high. The [...] "Tigris" [...] rolled {{from side to side}} as if she would go over, and some of the ladies were a good deal frightened; but she always came up again, all right, no matter how far over she dipped, and so in time they got used to it. I proved to Mrs. Chipperton that it would be {{impossible}} for the vessel to upset, as the great weight of ballast, freight, machinery, etc., in the lower part of her would always bring her deck up again, even if she rolled entirely over on her side, which, sometimes, she seemed as {{if she was going to}} do, but she always changed her mind just as we thought the thing was going to happen. The first mate told me that the reason we rolled so was because we had been obliged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> all <b>sail,</b> and that the mainsail had steadied the vessel very much before the wind got so high. This was all very well, but I didn't care much to know why the thing was. There are some people who think a thing's all right, if they can only tell you the reason for it.|$|R
