5|$|In the 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was {{replaced}} with one of marble.|$|E
5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors. The basement contained a well, which could also {{be drawn from the}} 1st floor through a hole in <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the work-in had finished, the {{boarding}} of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned {{in preparation for}} an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to £70. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News.|$|E
60|$|Over {{and over}} on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> rolled <b>the</b> boomer and his red enemy, now {{close to the}} fire and again off to one side, {{where there was a}} slight hollow still wet from the recent storm.|$|R
50|$|Because {{none of the}} {{interior}} walls make right angles, Stiles' dorm rooms are furnished with built-in desks and bookshelves. The college was once heated by a system that warmed <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floors,</b> but maintenance troubles led Yale to abandon it and install radiators.|$|R
2500|$|A pair of large, bare footprints, {{each about}} [...] in length, are carved into <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> portico, {{followed}} by a single footprint carved beyond the first two, and another single footprint carved into the threshold, [...] "marking the deity’s procession into the cella".|$|R
5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
60|$|Once again I woke--to {{find myself}} {{stretched}} at length upon <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Place of Isis {{that is at}} Abouthis. By me stood the old Priest of the Mysteries, and in his hand was a lamp. He bent over me, and gazed earnestly upon my face.|$|R
50|$|The new {{entrance}} {{building was}} built on a hillside as a massive two-storey building in the contemporary Art Nouveau style. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floors</b> are plastered and the gables of the transept are built of timber. Access to the station is upstairs. The platforms are reached via a footbridge from the entrance building.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls and}} dome inside Sinan Pasha Mosque were {{painted in the}} 19th century, mostly of floral {{patterns}} and Qur'an verses. The minbar is painted with floral motives. Both the large dome and the half-dome of the mosque are covered with lead. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> of <b>the</b> mosque and the carpentry are original.|$|R
25|$|No bedding was provided, so {{the prisoners}} slept on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> {{with only a}} bit of loose straw for comfort.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bodies}} {{had been laid}} out on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> Lassie, a {{crossbred}} collie owned by the pub owner, found her way down amongst the bodies, {{and she began to}} lick the face of one of the victims, Able Seaman John Cowan. She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone’s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|E
25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor.</b> Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though nothing had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] hissed Yellow Elk, {{when he saw}} how he had missed. He {{attempted}} to take him once more, but now Pawnee Brown hurled himself on the redskin, turning {{the barrel of the}} weapon aside, and both went to <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> with a crash. Nellie Winthrop let out a shriek of terror.|$|R
60|$|So {{we threw}} {{ourselves}} upon <b>the</b> hard <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of our prison and slept the sleep of tired men.|$|R
60|$|Without {{a word or}} a sound, {{save the}} sounds made by my hurrying feet on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring,</b> I fled up the steep steps, and through the dim expanse of the church, out into the bright sunlight. I found that I had {{mechanically}} raised the fallen lamp, and had taken it with me in my flight.|$|R
25|$|In {{the walls}} of the {{sanctuary}} are two corbels which have been re-set, and they may indicate the use of a Lenten veil. On the sanctuary floor are early 20thcentury memorial mosaics, with a crypt below. The chancel contains a 14thcentury piscina with an ogee opening, but the piscina and the top of the sedilia are low on the wall {{to the right of the}} altar, indicating a raising of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> which has 17th and 19thcentury ledgers. It has scribed render walls. The roof was restored in 1884, and is arch-braced with 4.5 bays.|$|E
25|$|Llangar Church is a 'Guardianship monument', {{meaning that}} {{responsibility}} for the Church building {{is now in the}} hands of Cadw, having been formerly part of St Asaph Diocese of the Church in Wales. There remains a facility for two services a year to be held within the Church. Responsibility for Llangar passed to the Secretary of State for Wales (Cadw's predecessor) in 1967., and a project to investigate and conserve the Church was begun in 1974. Archaeological excavations under <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> led by Ron Shoesmith, found no evidence dating back before the 14th century. The building was stabilised, made weatherproof, and in 1991 a scheme of work to reveal and conserve the wall paintings was completed. The building is accessible to visitors by arrangement with the Cadw staff based at Rug Chapel.|$|E
500|$|The new {{main beam}} for <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was {{installed}} {{and the ground}} floor was concreted. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse. Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine. New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the [...] thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft.|$|E
60|$|The candle was {{set down}} on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring,</b> close to <b>the</b> wall, {{and the two}} lads started to work without delay. In a corner of his jacket, Dick found an old {{jack-knife}} {{that had not been}} taken away from him, and this he used on the mortar. Sam had nothing but a long, rusty iron nail, so their progress was necessarily slow.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone</b> slab <b>floor</b> {{memorial}} to the four founders of the Royal Ballet was dedicated on 17 November 2009.|$|R
60|$|The {{search of}} the house was indeed fruitless. They cut open the bed, prized up every loose board in the bedroom and the parlor, lifted <b>the</b> hearth <b>stone,</b> tapped <b>the</b> walls, and searched every drawer; then, taking a lantern, went out into the stable. The {{officers}} were both accustomed to look for hiding places, and ran their hands along {{on the top of the}} walls, examining <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring</b> and manger.|$|R
500|$|The {{millstones}} {{were removed}} from <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> which was then repaired. One of the main beams {{was found to have}} been attacked by Death Watch beetles, and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by [...] causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> {{is where}} the two pairs of underdrift French Burr {{millstones}} are located. The stones are [...] and [...] diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the sack hoist on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an oat crusher and a flour dresser.|$|E
500|$|In May 1859 Josephine {{gave birth}} to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell [...] from the top-floor bannister onto <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. Josephine was distraught at the loss and had {{disturbed}} sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later. The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of accidental death.|$|E
50|$|Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a {{residence}} {{that the client}} wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floors</b> used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.|$|R
50|$|Markt 7 - Three-floor {{house with}} {{forward-facing}} gable and a corner oriel window. On <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> ground <b>floor</b> a pretty Renaissance portal, marked 1570.|$|R
60|$|On I stumbled, I {{scarcely}} know how. Twice I fell, once I {{turned up}} the bisecting passage, but fortunately found out my mistake in time. For twenty minutes or more I crept along, till at last {{it occurred to me}} that I must have passed the little stair by which I had descended. So, utterly exhausted, and nearly frightened to death, I sank down at length there on <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>flooring,</b> and sank into oblivion.|$|R
500|$|The Great Hall of Smithills Hall {{was built}} in the 14th century when William de Radcliffe {{received}} the Manor of Smithills from the Hultons, the chapel dates from the 16th century and was extended during the 19th. Smithills Hall was where, in 1555, George Marsh was tried for heresy during the Marian Persecutions. After being [...] "examined" [...] at Smithills, according to local tradition, George Marsh stamped his foot so hard to re-affirm his faith, that a footprint was left in <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor.</b> It is a Grade I listed building and is now a museum.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} work-in, the {{remainder}} of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and {{the reconstruction of the}} top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.|$|E
500|$|There are now [...] of gardens {{including}} St Andrew's Spring {{from which}} the city takes its name. The spring supplies St. Andrew's Well from which water flows {{at a rate of}} [...] per second into the moat which holds [...] The water emerging from the spring originates from the cave system of the Mendip Hills including Thrupe Lane Swallet. The Well House was built in 1451, for Bishop Beckington to provide water to the citizens of Wells in the market place. The small stone building with a slate roof has a central hole in <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>floor</b> giving access to the well itself. The gardens are listed, Grade II*, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he took a}} quick {{step towards}} me, and before I could prevent it he had thrown himself at my feet on <b>the</b> cold <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> and was holding my hands tightly in his.|$|R
60|$|Jeremiah held up {{his light}} {{and looked at the}} {{blackened}} ceiling, held down his light and looked at <b>the</b> damp <b>stone</b> <b>floor,</b> turned round with his light and looked about at the spotted and blotched walls.|$|R
