25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} {{progress}} of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director Peter Clifton was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral. Massot served a writ, leading to a period of stalemate which was finally broken when Grant and Led Zeppelin's lawyer Steve Weiss agreed to pay Massot the money he was owed, after which he delivered the film to the band. Massot was not invited to attend the premiere of the film at New York but he attended anyway, buying a <b>ticket</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>scalper</b> outside the theatre.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{documentary}} Standing in the Shadows of Motown, James Jamerson, {{a key component}} of the Motown sound, and member of The Funk Brothers who recorded many of the backing tracks to the Motown hits, had to buy a Motown 25 <b>ticket</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>scalper</b> and sat {{at the back of the}} hall with the general public. In addition, the [...] "Motown Sound," [...] which Motown producer Paul Riser would later credit The Funk Brothers and the musicians at Motown of creating in Standing in the Shadows of Motown, was crudely trivialized during a segment in Motown 25 where executives and employees at Motown, and even Berry Gordy himself, gave all kind of answers to what the Motown Sound was—with no answer giving credit to the musicians.|$|E

5000|$|When Lola auditions for {{the school}} play, a modernized musical version of Pygmalion called [...] "Eliza Rocks", she is chosen over Carla to play Eliza, and Carla {{promises}} to make her life miserable. Lola also beats Carla on a dancing video game at an arcade, where Carla reveals that she has tickets to the farewell concert of Sidarthur, who recently decided to break up. Afraid of being one-upped by Carla, Lola falsely claims that Ella and she have tickets, too. She loses her chance to buy tickets and new clothes when her mother takes away her allowance, and the concert is sold out {{by the time she}} persuades Ella to pay for the tickets. Lola explains that they can buy <b>tickets</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>scalper,</b> though, and she gets Sam to sneak Eliza's dress out of the costume room for her to wear at the concert.|$|R

50|$|Even if mileage is {{the sole}} factor in pricing apart from discounts, {{applicable}} to journeys exceeding a certain mileage, paradox may result for borderline cases. For example, a rail system practises a fare structure of $100 for the first 100 km and $6 for each additional 10 km. <b>A</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>from</b> <b>A</b> to B, 380 km apart, costs $268. If a discount of 15% applies to mileages exceeding 400 km only, <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>from</b> <b>A</b> to C, 420 km apart, would cost $292 × 85% = $248.2. A traveller may buy <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> <b>from</b> <b>A</b> to C and alight at B, avoiding the $19.80.|$|R
