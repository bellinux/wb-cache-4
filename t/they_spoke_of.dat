5|$|The crowd {{traveled}} {{the distance from}} Paris to Versailles in about six hours. Among their makeshift weaponry they dragged along several cannons taken from the Hôtel de Ville. Boisterous and energetic, they recruited (or impressed into service) more and more followers as they surged out of Paris in the autumn rain. In their ambiguous but always aggressive poissard slang, they chattered enthusiastically about bringing the king back home. Less affectionately, <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the queen, Marie Antoinette, and many had no restraint in calling for her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of.</b> He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
25|$|The Persians {{considered}} this Chaldean societal class to be masters {{of reading and}} writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> astrologists and astronomers as Chaldeans, and it is used with this specific meaning in the Book of Daniel (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.) and by classical writers, such as Strabo.|$|E

50|$|The Anishinaabe of North America, who {{include the}} Algonquin, Nipissing, Mississauga, Ojibwe, Saulteaux, Odawa and Potawatomi peoples. Many {{of these people}} were {{traditional}} neighbors to the Iroquois, but <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> languages <b>of</b> the Algonquian family.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the conversations}} were {{little more than}} gossip, and <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> their contemporaries without restraint. When the conversations were published, some of those contemporaries were outraged. Northcote denied the words were his; and Hazlitt was {{shielded}} from the consequences to a degree by his residing in Paris, where he was at work on what he thought would be his masterpiece.|$|E
25|$|Seventy-three hostages (including six minors) were {{rendered}} {{no medical}} aid. There were several Chechens among the hostages {{and it may}} be that some of them were not treated because of their Chechen names. Money and other valuables belonging to the victims vanished; official reports stated that the valuables were stolen by an FSB officer who was later killed in a car crash. The Russian authorities initially maintained that none of the deaths among the hostages occurred through poisoning. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> health problems that were exacerbated by the three-day ordeal with very little food or water, or indeed, medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> being accused of as spies and that their brother Simeon, had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned {{that they needed to}} bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
50|$|The Maina or Meena are a {{group of}} {{indigenous}} peoples living along the north bank of the Marañón River in South America. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> varieties <b>of</b> the Omurano language and resided along the North bank of the Marañón.|$|R
60|$|Robert merely laughed. That {{was how he}} {{took the}} scorn and {{condemnation}} of his fellow-men. He had goaded them to desperation with his shameless depravity till <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> openly <b>of</b> putting him to a violent death, and he laughed.|$|R
50|$|Before his death, {{he became}} {{friendly}} with Francis Reyes (who was later joined as a guitarist of the band) and <b>they</b> even <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> forming a thrash metal side project with drummer JB Leonor's brother Dennis.|$|R
25|$|In the Weekly Intelligence Summary of 10 March 1918, British {{intelligence}} {{predicted a}} German offensive in the Arras–St. Quentin area based on air reconnaissance photographs and {{the testimony of}} deserters; the prediction was reiterated in the next summary on 17 March. Allied aircraft had photographed German preparations, new supply roads had been constructed and shell craters {{had been turned into}} concealed trench mortar batteries. Heavily laden motorised and horse-drawn transports had been seen heading into St. Quentin from the east, and in the distance German officers were observed studying British lines. The British replied with nightly bombardments of the German front line, rear areas and possible assembly areas. A few days before the attack, two German deserters slipped through No Man's Land and surrendered to the 107th Brigade. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> troops, batteries of artillery and trench mortars massing on the German front. They reported massed trench mortars directly in front of 36th Division lines for wire cutting and an artillery bombardment, lasting several hours, as a preliminary to an infantry assault.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{became interested}} in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was the younger ones whose pastime it became to develop them. At {{the centre of the}} children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Brontë gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> them as the Young Men, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form, and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in little books, the size of a matchbox , and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.|$|E
500|$|After his death, Blackburn {{was praised}} by his {{coworkers}} and friends alike. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> his talent and enthusiasm, {{as well as}} his sometimes [...] "acerbic" [...] sense of humor. His wife, Fay, concluded that he had died doing what he loved.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> often <b>spoke</b> {{together}} <b>of</b> this scheme, ever decking it in brighter colours. The topic {{seemed to}} suit them {{better than their}} own future, for there was no dwelling on that without an occasional misgiving, and the more glad the anticipation, the deeper the sigh that followed on Margaret's part, till Mr. Ernescliffe followed her lead, and <b>they</b> seldom <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> these uncertainties, but outwardly smiled over the present, inwardly dwelt on the truly certain hopes. There were readings shared together, made more precious than all, by the conversations that ensued.|$|R

500|$|While Millett was {{speaking}} about sexual liberation at Columbia University, {{a woman in}} the audience asked her, [...] "Why don't you say you're a lesbian, here, openly. You've said you were a lesbian in the past." [...] Millett hesitantly responded, [...] "Yes, I am a lesbian". A couple of weeks later, Time December 8, 1970 article [...] "Women's Lib: A Second Look" [...] reported that Millett admitted she was bisexual, which it said would likely discredit her as a spokesperson for the feminist movement because it [...] "reinforce the views of those skeptics who routinely dismiss all liberationists as lesbians." [...] In response, two days later a press conference was organized by feminists Ivy Bottini and Barbara Love in Greenwich Village in which <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> their [...] "solidarity with the struggle of homosexuals to attain their liberation in a sexist society" [...] to Kate Millett and other attendees.|$|E
500|$|Medieval writers divided {{history into}} periods {{such as the}} [...] "Six Ages" [...] or the [...] "Four Empires", and {{considered}} their time {{to be the last}} {{before the end of the}} world. When referring to their own times, <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> them as being [...] "modern". In the 1330s, the humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (or [...] "ancient") and to the Christian period as nova (or [...] "new"). Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch's time, and therefore added a third period to Petrarch's two. The [...] "Middle Ages" [...] first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or [...] "middle season". In early usage, there were many variants, including medium aevum, or [...] "middle age", first recorded in 1604, and media saecula, or [...] "middle ages", first recorded in 1625. The alternative term [...] "medieval" [...] (or occasionally [...] "mediaeval" [...] or [...] "mediæval") derives from medium aevum. Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th-century historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern.|$|E
500|$|Of the Baltic tribes {{may have}} written Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy when <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the Veneti, Venedi or Venedai people. Pliny in Natural History locates {{them in the}} mouth of the Vistula region, while Ptolemy in Geographia just east of the lower Vistula along the Bay of Gdańsk. The Western Baltic Veneti's {{territory}} may have reached east all the way to Sambia. Tacitus in Germania, describing (possibly the same) inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic shores, mentioned the Aesti people, involved in collecting amber not for their own use but for long distance trade in a raw state. Jordanes in Getica speaks of the [...] "Aesti, who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean" [...] (beyond the Germanic-named Vidivarii people, who occupied the mouth of the Vistula area). This [...] "Ocean" [...] he defines as where the floods of the Vistula empty, the Baltic Sea. Various versions of the Aesti name were used later for various purposes; in particular that's what in the 9th century the Baltic Old Prussian people were called and their country was then referred to as Aestland.|$|E

The Medusae bear a vague resemblance to jellyfish, but are actually elephant-sized, four-eyed, flying beings with hundreds of tentacles. The Medusae cannot speak and communicate with one another via a microwave code.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{overlooked}} is {{the change}} following what may be called [...] "Hugh Bourne's Pentecost". In 1804, some [...] "revivalists" [...] from Stockport led the Michaelmas Love Feast at Congleton where <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> John Wesley's teaching of [...] "entire sanctification". [...] Jesse Ashworth, who knew some of these revivalists, records the change in Hugh Bourne and his companions. Their preaching, and the Church, found a new freedom and blessing from God. [...] They held a Christmas Love Feast at Harriseahead, with many standing on or between the pews for lack of space. This began the time of revival when some key Primitive Methodist leaders, most importantly William Clowes, were converted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1829, Andrew Wylie {{became the}} first {{president}}, serving {{until his death in}} 1851. The school's name was changed to [...] "Indiana College" [...] in 1829, and to [...] "Indiana University" [...] in 1839. Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. <b>They</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor David Starr Jordan, in 1885. Jordan followed Baptist theologian Lemuel Moss, who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor.|$|E

Three weeks after the attack, Pakistan was still reporting that he had escaped the raid and that they had been conducting house-to-house searches for him, although <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> having killed a [...] "high-ranking" [...] al-Qaeda member in the attack with a bounty on his head.|$|E
2500|$|The Wagluhe at Ft. Laramie {{heard of}} the 50,000 {{casualties}} of the three-day Battle at Gettysburg in July 1863, and knew what white men meant when <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> battle. The Wagluhe observed and learned the customs of the whites. Wagluhe were considered by the U.S. Army and Indian agents {{to be the most}} progressive band of Lakota and many became Indian Police, U.S. Army Indian Scouts with the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment and intermediaries with other bands of Lakotas. The Wagluhe formed a civil administration at Ft. Laramie and Old Chief Smoke appointed Chief Blue Horse and Chief Big Mouth the first Indian Police officers. [...] The U.S. Army concluded that, even if there were doubts about their reliability, the Wagluhe’s role as scouts, civil administrators and mediators was absolutely essential. The Wagluhe were the first Oglala Lakota {{to send their children to}} the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for a formal education, and the first to go Wild Westing with Col.

Sun Quan then held a {{farewell}} banquet for Liu Bei. After the feast, the others left while only Liu Bei and Sun Quan remained behind. When <b>they</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> Zhou Yu, Liu Bei said, [...] "Gongjin's talents and abilities are far greater than those of thousands of others. He possesses great ambitions and he may not be willing to remain subordinate for long." [...] In another incident, after his defeat at the hands of Zhou Yu at the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao remarked, [...] "I'm not ashamed of having lost the battle." [...] He later wrote to Sun Quan: [...] "At the Battle of Red Cliffs, my men were affected by a plague, so I burnt my warships and retreated of my own accord. That resulted in Zhou Yu claiming the glory (of winning the battle)." [...] Zhou Yu's widespread fame incurred much jealousy towards him, which was why Cao Cao and Liu Bei attempted to slander him and sow discord between him and Sun Quan.|$|E
