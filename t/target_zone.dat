It {{is a form}} of competitive Nordic skiing where athletes descend individually at very fast speeds along a specially built takeoff ramp using skis only; jump from the end of it with as much power as they can generate; then glide – or 'fly' – as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill; and ultimately land within a <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> in a stable manner. Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges, and events are governed by the International Ski Federation (FIS).|$|E

Countries located near the <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling debris. Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of space debris.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine issues of optimal {{stabilization}} in {{two types of}} world economy, a competitive one where all countries are small, and one {{where there is a}} Stackelberg leader. The focus is on the 1985 <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> proposal of Williamson, according to which there should be a periodic fixing of exchange rates at levels consistent with equilibrium real rates. World monetary policy should be assigned to the objective of international monetary stability and domestic stabilization policies to the internal balance objectives of individual economies. In a first-best world, where all economies use both monetary and fiscal policy, this appears to be the optimal arrangement. In a second-best world, where fiscal policy cannot be used, the additional constraint imposed by <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> might hinder rather than promote world stabilization. However, if the only country constrained in its use of fiscal policy is the Stackelberg leader, <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> might reproduce the optimal world monetary arrangement quite closely.

The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple econometric procedure for estimating expected exchange rate under <b>target</b> <b>zones.</b> We employ the linear projection methodology to make predictions without relying on any prior structural or distributional assumptions, {{and at the}} same time demonstrate that such a methodology has to be modified in an important way to account for the presence of the fluctuation band. Our empirical results show that the band effect is nontrivial for narrow <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> such as the Bretton Woods system. We also develop a method to estimate the shapes of the unconditional distributions of exchange rates under <b>target</b> <b>zones.</b> The empirical results show that the unconditional distributions of exchange rates can take several different shapes, which may correspond to possibly widely different monetary and exchange-rate intervention policies. We also show how to use the projection equations and the information about the band to test the credibility of the exchange rate regimes. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{wide array}} of factors affect both games (from {{composition}} of the pitch or field soil to weather conditions, wind, and moisture) and numerous strategies in both games can be employed to exploit these factors. Other than the bowler, cricket places very few restrictions on fielding placement, even for the wicket-keeper, and its variety of bowling styles, 360 degrees of open field, wide bowling area (<b>target</b> <b>zone),</b> and so on give scope for strategic play. Notable exceptions include the limit of two fielders in the leg side quadrant, introduced to prevent the use of Bodyline tactics, and limiting outfield players {{in the early stages}} of limited overs matches and the subsequent introduction of powerplays. In baseball, there are very specific rules about the positions of the pitcher and the catcher at the start of each play. The positioning of the other seven fielders is as flexible as cricket, except that each one must start the play positioned in fair territory. The fielders are otherwise free to position themselves anywhere on the playing field, based on the game situation.|$|E

Together with the cautious shifting of the <b>target</b> <b>zone</b> during the planning stage, many of the markers were dropped too far forward, pushing the bombed zone well into Caen, further away from the German defences. By 22:00 on 7 July, the bombers had departed, leaving 80 percent of the north of Caen destroyed. Caen University was particularly hard hit, starting chemical fires that soon spread. At 22:50, six squadrons of de Havilland Mosquito bombers attacked individual targets and ten minutes later the 636 guns of the assaulting divisions opened fire, with the battleship [...] and other ships adding their support.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a quantitative methodology for deriving optimal exploration <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> {{based on a}} probabilistic mineral prospectivity map. The methodology is demonstrated in the Rodalquilar mineral district in Spain. A subset of known occurrences of mineral deposits of the type sought was considered discovered and then used as training data, and a map of distances to faults/fractures and three band ratio images of hyperspectral data were used as layers of spatial evidence in weights-of-evidence (WofE) modeling of mineral prospectivity in the study area. A derived posterior probability map of mineral deposit occurrence showing non-violation of the conditional independence assumption and having the highest prediction rate was then put into an objective function in simulated annealing in order to derive a set of optimal exploration focal points. Each optimal exploration focal point represents a pixel or location within a circular neighborhood of pixels with high posterior probability of mineral deposit occurrence. Buffering of each optimal exploration focal point, based on proximity analysis, resulted in optimal exploration <b>target</b> <b>zones.</b> Many of these <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> coincided spatially {{with at least one}} occurrence of mineral deposit of the type sought in the subset of cross-validation (i. e., presumed undiscovered) mineral deposits of the type sought.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical evaluation {{of two of}} the most influential recent proposals for international monetary reform, namely McKinnon's standard with fixed exchange rates and Williamson's <b>target</b> <b>zones.</b> The focus is on the implications of the proposals for short-run stabilization policy. The results suggest that in a first-best world where all countries have recourse to both monetary and fiscal policy, the McKinnon standard would be not only desirable, but also feasible, in the sense that if world monetary policy is set optimally, there is no incentive for individual economies to engage in exchange rate management. In the absence of fiscal flexibility, even when world monetary policy is set optimally, exchange rate management becomes necessary to counteract the distortions arising from country-specific supply shocks. The nominal exchange rate flexibility inherent in the <b>target</b> <b>zones</b> proposal is then a necessary part of the optimal (second-best) world monetary system. The analysis, however, suggests no role for either explicit bands or nominal income targets. Fixed Exchange Rates; International Monetary Reform; <b>Target</b> <b>Zones...</b>|$|R
500|$|With the {{escalating}} situation in Southeast Asia, 28 B-52Fs were fitted with external racks for 24x 750lb (340kg) bombs under project South Bay in June 1964; an additional 46 aircraft received similar modifications under project Sun Bath. In March 1965, the United States commenced Operation Rolling Thunder. The first combat mission, Operation Arc Light, was flown by B-52Fs on 18 June 1965, when 30 bombers of the 9th and 441st Bombardment Squadrons struck a communist stronghold near the Bến Cát District in South Vietnam. The {{first wave of}} bombers arrived too early at a designated rendezvous point, and while maneuvering to maintain station, two B-52s collided, {{which resulted in the}} loss of both bombers and eight crewmen. The remaining bombers, minus one more that turned back due to mechanical problems, continued toward the target. Twenty-seven Stratofortresses dropped on a one-mile by two-mile target box from between 19,000 and 22,000feet, a little more than 50% of the bombs falling within the <b>target</b> <b>zone.</b> The force returned to Andersen AFB except for one bomber with electrical problems that recovered to Clark AFB, the mission having lasted 13 hours. Post-strike assessment by teams of South Vietnamese troops with American advisors found evidence that the Viet Cong had departed the area before the raid, and it was suspected that infiltration of the south's forces may have tipped off the north because of the South Vietnamese Army troops involved in the post-strike inspection.|$|E

While all methods produce reasonably good estimates of the expected size of devaluations, they did not predict the September 1992 EMS crisis.
