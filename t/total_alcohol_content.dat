50|$|After {{fermentation}} is complete, {{the base}} wines are fortified with grape spirit {{in order to}} increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a <b>total</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol is an {{important}} determinant of the high and fluctuating adult mortality rates in Russia, but cause-specific detail is lacking. Our case-control study investigated the effects of alcohol consumption on male and female cause-specific mortality.

Family members were present for 50, 066 decedents; for 48, 557 (97 %), the family gave proxy information on the decedents' past alcohol use and on potentially confounding factors. Cases (n= 43, 082) were those certified as dying from causes we judged beforehand might be substantially affected by alcohol or tobacco; controls were the other 5475 decedents. Case versus control relative risks (RRs; calculated as odds ratios by confounder-adjusted logistic regression) were calculated in ever-drinkers, defining the reference category by two criteria: usual weekly consumption always less than 0. 5 half-litre bottles of vodka (or equivalent in <b>total</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content)</b> and maximum consumption of spirits in 1 day always less than 0. 5 half-litre bottles. Other ever-drinkers were classified by usual weekly consumption into three categories: less than one, one to less than three, {{and three or more}} (mean 5. 4 [SD 1. 4]) bottles of vodka or equivalent. FINDINGS: In men, the three causes accounting for the most alcohol-associated deaths were accidents and violence (RR 5. 94, 95 % CI 5. 35 - 6. 59, in the highest consumption category), alcohol poisoning (21. 68, 17. 94 - 26. 20), and acute ischaemic heart disease other than myocardial infarction (3. 04, 2. 73 - 3. 39), which includes some misclassified alcohol poisoning. There were significant excesses of upper aerodigestive tract cancer (3. 48, 2. 84 - 4. 27) and liver cancer (2. 11, 1. 64 - 2. 70).

The blueberry wine making process is an alternative to expand the beverage industry and offers to the consumer a value-added product as well as a new market for Brazilian blueberry producers. The objectives of this study were to produce wines from blueberries and to evaluate the effect of deacidification (with calcium carbonate) and chaptalization (with glucose syrup or sucrose) on physicochemical characteristics, antioxidant content, and sensory parameters.

40|$|Wine {{is one of}} the {{functional}} fermented foods that have many health benefits. Commercially, wine is produced by the fermentation of yeast which involves the conversion of sugar to alcohol. Wine can act as a nutrient supplement for seasonal fruits and vegetables throughout the year. Using fruits and vegetables having medicinal and nutritional value as a substrate for wine production, the health benefits of them can be improved widely. Ginger and Indian gooseberry, which are known for its high medicinal and nutritional value are used as the substrate here. Fermentation is carried out with Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly known as bakers yeast. Daily monitoring was done to study the composition and characteristics of the wine. The wine produced resembled the commercial wine in terms of its composition, taste and aroma. During the fermentation period the wines were analyzed for pH, titratable acidity, specific gravity, biomass <b>content,</b> <b>alcohol</b> and reducing sugar on a daily basis. pH show a decreased trend then attains minima and then increased. As the fermentation days proceed, the specific gravity increased and the alcohol percentage increased gradually. Batch 1 Amla (A 1) showed a pH range of 3. 79 - 3. 56, specific gravity ranges from 1. 09 - 1. 17 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 10. 5 %. Batch 2 Amla (A 2) showed a pH range of 3. 81 - 3. 30, specific gravity ranges from 1. 09 - 1. 167 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 10. 35 %. Batch 3 Amla (A 3) showed a pH range of 3. 83 - 3. 34, specific gravity ranges from 1. 032 - 1. 0967 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 8. 64 %. Batch 1 ginger (G 1) showed a pH range of 3. 77 - 3. 59, specific gravity ranges from 1. 11 - 1. 178 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 7. 94 %. Batch 2 ginger (G 2) showed a pH range of 3. 89 - 3. 94, specific gravity ranges from 1. 116 - 1. 162 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 6. 81 %. Batch 3 ginger (G 3) showed a pH range of 4. 42 - 4. 01, specific gravity ranges from 1. 144 - 1. 188 and <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was 5. 81 %. After the fermentation period parameters such as Tannin content, Phenol content, Free and <b>Total</b> SO 2, <b>Alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> <b>Total</b> Suspended Solids (oBrix), pH, Titratable Acidity and Specific Gravity were analyzed. These parameters were compared with that of commercial wine. The tannin content of the 3 batches of amla and ginger wine ranges between 3. 1 to 0. 4 mg/ 100 ml but the commercial wine contain only 0. 28 mg/ml. When comparing phenol content, the commercial wine showed a value of 0. 20 mg/ml but the 3 batches of wine had a higher range of 0. 7 to 0. 9 mg/ml. The total suspended solids of the amla and ginger wines were between 43 to 45 obrix. But for commercial wine the TSS was 32. 23 obrix. The pH showed a different trend. pH of amla is between 3. 3 and 3. 5 but for ginger it ranges from 3. 7 and for commercial its 3. 56 which is relatively higher than amla. The specific gravity is lower for the 3 batches of amla and ginger wine which ranges from 1. 2 to 1. 21 but 1. 24 is the specific gravity of commercial wine. The titrable acidity showed for ginger wine is 2 to 3. 5 mg/ml but for amla it is 8. 9 to 5. 5 mg/ml. the commercial wine had a value higher than ginger i. e., 4. 2 mg/ml.

In this paper we explore these questions using international evidence, combining time-series data on the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine from a large number of countries that experienced different patterns of climate change and influences of policy and demand shifts. We also examine the relationship between the actual <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine and the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> stated on the label. The systematic patterns here suggest that rising <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine may be a nuisance by-product of producer responses to perceived market preferences for wines having riper, more-intense flavors, possibly in conjunction with evolving climate. wine grapes, alcohol percentage, climate change, labeling errors, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Marketing,...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of proof}} {{as a measure}} of <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> is now mostly historical. Today, liquor is sold in most {{locations}} with labels that state its <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> as its percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV).|$|R
50|$|For {{purposes}} of law enforcement, blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> {{is used to}} define intoxication and provides a rough measure of impairment. Although the degree of impairment may vary among individuals with the same blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> it can be measured objectively and is therefore legally useful and difficult to contest in court. Most countries disallow operation of motor vehicles and heavy machinery above prescribed levels of blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b> Operation of boats and aircraft are also regulated.|$|R
30|$|In the RLMS, {{individual}} {{alcohol consumption}} is self-reported by the respondent {{in the health}} module. In Russia, alcohol consumption is measured in grams instead of litres, so each respondent is asked to declare how many grams of beer, wine, fortified wine, home-made liquor, vodka, and other alcoholic beverages they usually drink per day during the last 30 days. However, only from round XV {{it is possible to}} identify the actual monthly consumption, since respondents have also to declare the days per month they have been drinking. Following Baltagi and Geishecker (2006), these amounts are adjusted for pure <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> {{in order to make the}} various types of alcoholic beverages comparable and then summed up to compute <b>total</b> individual <b>alcohol</b> consumption. The weights used are 5 % for the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of beer, 10 % for wine, 19 % for fortified wine, 45 % for home made liquor, 40 % for vodka, and 20 % for other alcohol. Finally, the alcohol variables included in the equations are computed as the logarithm of grams of <b>total</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake per week, and divided by the body mass index of the person, in order to control for the possibly different impact of similar amounts of alcohol on different sized individuals. As to the possible doubts on the validity of self-reported measures of alcohol consumption, we follow the idea, again found in Baltagi and Geishecker (2006), that self-declared alcohol consumption in Russia should not be under-reported, since there is no social stigma attached to alcohol consumption within the country. Recall errors are still possible, but at least there should not be a clear negative bias in the declared quantities.|$|R

These both come in 330 mL bottles. Beerlao Light has been discontinued.|$|R

The <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> in Greece is 5%. Mythos Brewery also produces Mythos Red in 330ml bottles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For medicolegal purposes, breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> is {{typically}} determined from an end-expiratory sample. Measurements obtained by this method necessarily underestimate the alveolar breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> and therefore underestimate the blood <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b> We suggest and analyse an improved paradigm which uses the entire time-series of breath alcohol measurements during exhalation, {{not simply the}} last recorded value. We present two mathematical models for the exhaling lung, and discuss the implications of each for more accurate and therefore more reliable breath alcohol measurement...|$|R

Before being bottled the liquor may be further mixed to adjust for desired colour, aroma and taste, but it has to have at least 40% <b>alcohol</b> <b>content.</b>|$|R
