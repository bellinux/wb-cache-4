5|$|The trio {{explored}} {{the world around}} them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{his career}} Fred Curry struck {{out on his own}} more and more <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his father’s legacy of rule-breaking and {{violence}} to establish a legacy of his own. Fred’s attempts to get out of his father’s shadow never caused any problems between the two Currys.|$|E
25|$|The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable {{numbers of}} German and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They {{may have been}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Huns, who about this time {{advanced}} to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For {{the next few years}} the barbarian tribes who had crossed the Rhine wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.|$|E

500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, {{but at the same time}} hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about any time. I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Spearmon as fast as I could." [...] After noting that he was feeling worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period {{in preparation for the}} 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E

2500|$|Santana {{said that}} after a {{struggle}} in which Slager deployed his Taser, Scott was [...] "just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Taser," [...] and that before he started recording, he observed that Slager [...] "had control of the situation". In an interview on The Today Show, Santana said Scott [...] "never grabbed the Taser of the police. He never got the Taser." ...|$|E
2500|$|A witness {{said the}} cause of the stampede was [...] "too many people on the bridge and...both ends were pushing. This caused a sudden panic. The pushing caused those in the middle to fall to the ground, then [...] crushed." [...] While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the stampede, he said that people pulled down {{electrical}} wires, causing more people to die of electrocution. [...] These claims were backed up by one of the doctors treating patients, who said that electrocution and suffocation were the primary causes of death among the casualties, though the government disputed the claims of electric shock.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{carnival}} mood," [...] {{she repeated}} thoughtfully, [...] "yes, that expresses it. We are light, {{we are always}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> ourselves, and sometimes I wonder whether there are any selves to get away from.

6000|$|... 'No one,' {{continued}} Robert Bolton, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> sentiment {{into real}} argument,--'no one can {{have been more}} intent on separating them than William was when {{he thought that the}} evidence was against him.

60|$|The whole lower {{story of}} the yellow house was in flames, and every masculine, feminine, and canine in Rosa was there, {{screeching}} and barking and {{getting in the way}} of the firemen.

60|$|But {{the crabs}} {{proved to be}} much more lively fish than their enemies had supposed. Turning, as if on a pivot, and darting from side to side, they seemed to be playing with the boats, and not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them. The spring armour of Crab K {{interfered}} somewhat with its movements, and also put it in danger from attacks by grapnels, and it therefore left most of the work to its consort.|$|E
