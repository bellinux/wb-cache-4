5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows that}} faced {{the street in}} the study hall were never opened in order to prevent distractions. A noise was once heard outside the study hall. One of the {{students}} opened the window and looked out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Rb Ziv commented that he did not see that there was any possibility that that student would become an accomplished person.|$|E
25|$|The laws {{included}} {{safety standards}} and specifications that were {{virtually impossible for}} barnstormers to meet, and restrictions on how low in altitude certain tricks could be performed (making it harder for spectators <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening).</b> The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. Clyde Pangborn, who was pilot of the two-man aviation team who {{were the first to}} cross the Pacific Ocean nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931. Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.|$|E

25|$|The pair were {{partners}} in 'Hudson Amusements' {{and had been}} operating their amusements in Omeath {{for the duration of}} the Omeath Gala. When the first explosion was heard across the Lough, the pair went down to the shore <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> The pair made their way to Narrow Water on the southern side to get a better view of what was happening on the northern side of the Lough. Barry Hudson was shot in the arm and as he fell to the ground he saw his cousin, who was the son of a coachman at Buckingham Palace, fall to the ground. He died almost immediately.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July, {{the four}} foreign {{observers}} {{returned to the}} battlefield at 5am, in time to witness a meeting between Generals Lee, Longstreet, Hill, John Bell Hood and Henry Heth. Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> {{this time in the}} company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above the din of battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 1917, Sykes (who {{had been}} sent to France in mid-December <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> with the Projet d'Arrangement) and a {{representative}} of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the Central Syrian Congress in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.|$|E

25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E
25|$|Between 5:00p.m. and 6:00p.m. Schulz {{and another}} man rowed across the harbor <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> They {{followed}} {{the sounds of the}} shooting until they came to the old citadel. By standing on a bunker at the citadel they could see a long deep trench which was said to have been dug by the Jews the previous day. This was about one kilometer north of the lighthouse. They watched for about an hour or an hour and a half. During that time, three or four trucks arrived at the site, each carrying five Jews. They were forced to lie down in the truck. When the truck reached the site, the driver took the vehicle right up to the trench. Latvian guards, wielding clubs, forced the victims to enter directly into the trench. A squad of five men, possibly Latvians, but more probably German SD men, then shot them in the head. The supervising SS or SD officer then shot again any one not immediately killed.|$|E
25|$|Suchet left Molins de Rei in {{the early}} evening. Marching rapidly, his troops arrived {{in front of the}} Ordal {{position}} at 11:00 PM. To his amazement, he found that the Allies failed to post any pickets. Suchet hustled his troops across the unguarded bridge and moved them uphill toward the drowsy Allies. As the French troops moved forward, telltale noises aroused the interest of a Spanish cavalry patrol, which trotted forward <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> These horsemen were greeted by a blast of musketry, which awakened Adam's men. At the front of Harispe's division, General of Brigade Jean Mesclop led the 7th Line to the attack. Halfway up the hill, the 7th Line bumped into an entrenchment held by four Spanish infantry companies. The defenders fell back to a second field work higher up the hillside. After being joined by more Spaniards, these soldiers mounted a counterattack, which briefly pushed back the 7th Line.|$|E

500|$|Aubame {{was unaware}} of the coup until the French {{ambassador}} to Gabon, Paul Cousseran, called him on the telephone roughly a half hour after sunrise. Cousseran, meanwhile, was awoken by the noisy streets and checked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Aubame replied that he was to find out why there was [...] "no government", as Cousseran never directly mentioned a coup. However, about midway through the morning an automobile carrying the revolutionary committee arrived at Aubame's residence and drove him to the governmental offices, where he had been named president.|$|E
500|$|As news of [...] "John Johnson's" [...] arrest {{spread among}} the {{plotters}} still in London, most fled northwest, along Watling Street. [...] Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together. [...] Rookwood left soon after, {{and managed to}} cover 30miles in two hours on one horse. [...] He overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill, before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road. [...] Reunited, the group continued northwest to Dunchurch, using horses provided by Digby. [...] Keyes went to Mordaunt's house at Drayton. [...] Meanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> When he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister's house at Norbrook, before continuing to Huddington Court.|$|E
500|$|The rescuers, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt to force open the van with hatchets, sledgehammers, and crowbars, called upon Police Sergeant Brett, who {{was inside the}} van with the prisoners, to open the door. Brett refused, {{so one of the}} rescuers placed his revolver at the keyhole of the van to blow the lock, just as Brett looked through the keyhole <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> outside. The bullet passed through his eye into his brain and killed him. The door was opened when one of the women prisoners took the keys from Brett's pocket, and passed them through a ventilator to the Fenians outside, allowing Kelly and Deasy to escape. Brett was the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty, in an incident that became known locally as the [...] "Manchester Outrages".|$|E

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|A {{police officer}} interrogates Parker (Julie Gonzalo) about her rape, {{but she does}} not {{remember}} any of it. Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) sociology professor recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck in a bear trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they just drive her home.|$|E
2500|$|Ms Proetta, an {{independent}} witness, told Thames Television, 'They [...] didn't do anything ... they just went and shot these people. That's all. They didn't say anything, they didn't scream, they didn't shout, they didn't do anything. These people were turning their heads back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> {{and when they}} saw these men had guns in their hands they put their hands up. It looked like the man was protecting the girl because he {{stood in front of}} her, but there was no chance. I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped.' ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{change in}} {{marketing}} focus led {{to only one}} race per year beginning in 1911. An estimated 80,000 spectators attended the first [...] race on Memorial Day, May 30, 1911. Forty cars competed with Ray Harroun winning at an average speed of [...] While all the other drivers in the race had a riding mechanic in their car, Harroun decided to save weight and go faster by driving solo. So, to be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> behind his No. 32 Marmon [...] "Wasp", he installed a rear-view mirror.

2500|$|One {{evening in}} 1912, a {{performance}} at the Opera House in Nacogdoches, Texas, was interrupted by shouts from outside about a runaway mule. The audience hurried out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Groucho was angered by the interruption and, when the audience returned, he made snide comments at their expense, including [...] "Nacogdoches is full of roaches" [...] and [...] "the jackass is the flower of Tex-ass". Instead of becoming angry, the audience laughed. The family then realized that it had potential as a comic troupe. (However, in his autobiography Harpo Speaks, Harpo Marx stated that the runaway mule incident occurred in Ada, Oklahoma. A 1930 article in the San Antonio Express newspaper stated that the incident took place in Marshall, Texas.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> and followed crowds of people {{to the scene of the}} fire.|$|E
