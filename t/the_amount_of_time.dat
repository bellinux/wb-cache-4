40|$|Abstract Dietary {{protein intake}} and {{specifically}} {{the quality of}} the protein in the diet has become an area of recent interest. This study determined the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> quality protein, carbohydrate, and dietary fat consumed and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> ~ 10 g essential amino acid (EAA) threshold was reached at a meal, with percent central abdominal fat (CAF). Quality protein was defined as the ratio of EAA to total dietary protein. Quality protein consumed in a 24 -hour period and <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> reaching <b>the</b> EAA threshold per day was inversely related to percent CAF, but not for carbohydrate or dietary fat. In conclusion, moderate to strong correlations between variables indicate that quality and distribution of protein may {{play an important role in}} regulating CAF, which is a strong independent marker for disease and mortality. </p...|$|R

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains for <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, {{members of the community}} know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them.

The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute.
