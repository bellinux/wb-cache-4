5|$|During his {{period in}} Berlin, {{he came in}} contact with and was greatly {{influenced}} by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the necessity for politicians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.|$|E
5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E

2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At {{one point in the}} trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, {{it sounds to me like}} the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
2500|$|Venn {{himself did}} not use the term [...] "Venn diagram" [...] and {{referred}} to his invention as [...] "Eulerian Circles". For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, [...] "Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, even those who have made no professional study of logic, may be supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance..." [...] The first to use the term [...] "Venn diagram" [...] was Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, in his book [...] "A Survey of Symbolic Logic".|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the Ciceronian period, where {{sentences}} {{were usually}} {{the length of}} a paragraph and artfully constructed with nested pairs of carefully matched sonorous phrases, this is short and to the point. [...] But it is also very individual. Note the three different ways of saying and in the first line (-que, et, ac), and especially the matched second and third lines. They are parallel in sense but not in sound; the pairs of words ending [...] "…-entibus …-is" [...] are crossed over in a way that deliberately breaks the Ciceronian conventions—which one would however need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> to see the novelty of Tacitus' style. Some readers, then and now, find this teasing of their expectations merely irritating. Others find the deliberate discord, playing against the evident parallelism of the two lines, stimulating and intriguing.|$|E

2500|$|The book sparked {{controversy}} {{in the press and}} academic circles. Some historians have characterized its reception {{as an extension of the}} Historikerstreit, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a [...] "publishing phenomenon", achieving fame in both the United States and Germany despite being criticized by some historians, who called it ahistorical and, according to Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, [...] "totally wrong about everything" [...] and [...] "worthless." [...] Due to its alleged [...] "generalizing hypothesis" [...] about Germans, it has been characterized as anti-German. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer claims that [...] "Goldhagen stumbles badly," [...] and Does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> some basic developments in German society in the nineteenth century. Certainly, there was what he calls eliminationist antisemitism and its impact increased as the century matured...But antisemitism came in different forms, and Goldhagen puts all antisemitism in the same basket, including the liberal type that wanted to see the Jews disappear by assimilation and conversion...The vast majority of German antisemitics did not wish to abolish formal Jewish emancipation. Goldhagen makes much of the radical antisemitism of the Conservative Party in Germany; but in 1893 it obtained less than 10 percent of the votes, whereas the National Liberals, among whom there were a number of former Jews, were much more numerous. Goldhagen ignores this and makes the counterfactual statement that [...] "conservatives and völkisch nationalists in Germany...formed the vast majority of the population. By 1912, the Social Democrats, with an explicitly anti-antisemitic program, were the largest party in the German Reichstag, and the Progressives ran very strongly as well...Formally, at least, the Jews had been fully emancipated with the establishment of the German Empire, although they were kept out of certain influential occupations, enjoyed extraordinary prosperity...Germans intermarried with Jews: in the 1930s some 50,000 Jews were living in mixed German-Jewish marriages, so at least 50,000 Germans, and presumably parts of their families, had familial contact with the Jews. Goldhagen himself mentions that a large proportion of the Jewish upper classes in Germany converted to Christianity in the nineteenth century. In a society where eliminationist norms were universal and in which Jews were rejected even after they had converted, or so he argues, the rise of this extreme form of assimilation of Jews would hardly have been possible." [...] Bauer argues that [...] "Goldhagen's thesis does not work." [...] and charges [...] "...that the anti-German bias of his book, almost a racist bias (however much he may deny it) leads nowhere." [...] The American historian Fritz Stern denounced the book as unscholarly and full of racist Germanophobia. Hilberg summarised the debates, [...] "by the end of 1996, it was clear that in sharp distinction from lay readers, much of the academic world had wiped Goldhagen off the map." ...|$|E
