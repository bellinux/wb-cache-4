5|$|The {{last few}} {{years of his life}} were also {{occupied}} in collaboration with other Masonic researchers, such as Hughan and Gould, which eventually brought into being England's first research lodge, Quatuor Coronati. As acting Immediate Past Master, he guided the lodge through its first two years of existence, taking <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> the frequent absences of the Master, Charles Warren, then Metropolitan Commissioner of Police. It is plain from Gould's obituary {{that the rest of the}} lodge looked on him as a mentor.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{became a}} fellow of the British Academy in 1971 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983.

Several universities awarded him honorary doctorates, including Yale and Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Born's {{position}} at Cambridge {{was only a}} temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> October 1936.|$|E

In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita. During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.|$|E
5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more {{time to work on}} the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E

25|$|This {{trend was}} {{somewhat}} reversed {{in the seventeenth}} century, with the University of Aberdeen creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> <b>in</b> Geometry being set up in University of Oxford in 1619 and the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics being established by the University of Cambridge in 1662.

After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700kg of gold.

After a Conservative filibuster, Touche passed over Aneurin Bevan and called Christopher Soames to close the debate, but Bevan also insisted on speaking. Touche insisted that he had no choice, while Bevan and Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell objected; eventually the Speaker took the chair and endorsed his Deputy's actions.|$|E
