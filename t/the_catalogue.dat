5|$|Richard Janko, who {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> was composed c. 690, argues that {{the extent to which}} Pindar relied upon the Hesiodic text is unknown and that, even if Apollo did carry Cyrene to Libya, this does not presuppose an aetiology of the city. Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> or the Megalai Ehoiai: the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> treated Cyrene at all. The complete removal of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence—it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue,</b> and his son Actaeon certainly appeared in the poem.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> Among these finds were important passages, <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E
5|$|According to the Suda, <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> {{was five}} books long. The length of each is unknown, {{but it is}} likely that the entire poem {{consisted}} of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed reflect the poem's overall arrangement.|$|E
5|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century progressed, there were several other {{important}} observations about the genealogical structure of <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected {{to the family of}} Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there. The picture of <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> that was emerging began to resemble the Bibliotheca in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed {{with the help of the}} mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> and Ehoiai were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.|$|E

50|$|The Catalog of Stellar Identifications (CSI) {{is a star}} catalog {{which was}} {{constructed}} to facilitate cross-referencing between different star catalogs. It contains designations and basic data for, as of 1983, approximately 440,000 stars, and was created by merging the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, <b>the</b> Henry Draper <b>Catalogue,</b> <b>the</b> AGK2/3, <b>the</b> Cape Photographic <b>Catalogue,</b> <b>the</b> Cape Zone <b>Catalogue,</b> <b>the</b> Yale Zone <b>Catalogue,</b> <b>the</b> Cape <b>Catalogue</b> of Faint Stars, and <b>the</b> Boss General <b>Catalogue.</b> It contains stellar coordinates, magnitudes, spectral types, proper motions, and cross-references to designations in the previously mentioned catalogs.

5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist symbols to be banned from Polish football stadiums. <b>The</b> <b>catalogue,</b> co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right symbols that are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. <b>The</b> <b>catalogue</b> listed other racist and fascist symbols like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed in <b>the</b> <b>catalogue</b> of extreme-right symbols banned at Polish football stadiums.

5|$|Athamas {{ruled in}} Boeotia {{and had a}} {{complicated}} family life, several details of which {{are known to have}} played part in <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment in <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fragments}} {{that are}} securely attributed to <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue,</b> {{some of which}} are relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could be assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} have not shared {{the confidence of}} their Hellenistic counterparts, and today <b>the</b> <b>Catalogue</b> is {{generally considered to be}} a post-Hesiodic composition.
