5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that hair length and quality {{can act as a}} cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

25|$|The Rosetta probe {{actually}} {{found that the}} asteroid has a moderately red spectrum in the visible light and essentially flat spectrum in the near infrared. No absorption features were detected in the range covered by observations, 0.4–3.5μm. Thus previous reports of hydrated minerals and organic compounds {{on the surface of}} Lutetia have been disproven. The surface also does not contain any olivine. Together with the high density of Lutetia <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that it is either made of the enstatite chondrite material or may be related to metal-rich and water-poor carbonaceous chondrite of classes like CB, CH, or CR.|$|E
25|$|For bicalutamide, the antiandrogenic {{activities}} of sulfide and sulfone substitions of the X-linkage {{were tested in}} vitro. The sulfides showed in most cases at least 2-fold higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO2CH3, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold {{higher than that of}} sulfide. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that substituents of the B-ring largely determine the effect of the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an acetyl group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|A {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} study found that a single low dose of 10mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day citalopram. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine {{may be able to}} achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine.|$|E

More generally, the authors suggest <b>these</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate,</b> following the argument of Stephen Jay Gould, [...] "that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact" [...] on the course of evolution.

2500|$|Pareidolia {{can cause}} people to {{interpret}} random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area {{at a time and}} location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. [...] A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. <b>These</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.|$|E
