5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when <b>they</b> <b>disappear,</b> and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by Yūko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. <b>They</b> <b>disappear</b> after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music {{during the fall}} of 1998. The video begins with Houston {{entering}} a small arena as she begins to sing the song's first verse. As she finishes her part, Carey appears on the stage as well, performing the second verse and chorus. The video {{is set in a}} dark studio accented by Egyptian settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by The Prince of Egypt. An audience is on hand to emulate a concert-like-setting, cheering on both singers. Occasionally, home video clips of Carey and Houston appear throughout the video, as well as clips of the final moments of the film, during the splitting of the Red Sea. The video ends as the room is illuminated, and the two singers are joined by a large choir. As they complete the song, Carey and Houston receive a standing ovation from the crowd, and exit the studio together, walking side by side as <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> in the distance. For the video, Carey and Houston both donned similar low-cut black gowns, while Carey sported a long straight hairstyle, and Houston a pixie cut.|$|E

25|$|Jim Sinclair, {{a leader}} in the movement, argues that autism is {{essential}} to a person, not a disease secondary to the person. Sinclair says that wishing that an autistic person be cured is equivalent to wishing that <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> and another completely different person exist in their place. Visions for a future where autism has been eradicated, Sinclair believes, is the desire to end the autistic culture.|$|E
25|$|All {{over the}} world, a rain begins to fall. People {{in the five}} nations comment on how odd this is, and how salty the rain tastes. The rain accumulates into the long-lost Ocean. At the same time, all the world's Greythornes come {{together}} and transform into the mighty Whale, with Xelha's Greythorne Meemei becoming the Whale's brain. For a moment, {{the people of the}} world regain their lost wings before <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> in a shimmer of light.|$|E
25|$|In 69 CE, the Year of the Four Emperors, Otho's {{troops at}} Bedriacum {{included}} 2000 gladiators. Opposite {{him on the}} field, Vitellius's army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators. In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense. During the Civil Wars {{that led to the}} Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> from the record.|$|E

25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money. He, Tracy and Tommy leave, and then Sam retrieves the real briefcase full of money from the extra secret compartment in the table that Maurice didn't know about. He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.|$|E
25|$|Xenos moutoni is {{a common}} {{parasite}} among Vespa species. In a study of parasites among species of Vespa, 4.3% of V. mandarinia females were parasitized. Males were not stylopized (parasitized by Stylopidae, such as xenos moutoni) at all. The width of the stylopid’s head and the host’s head are positively correlated. The major consequence of being parasitized is the inability to reproduce for the following year. Stylopized queens follow the same fate as uninseminated queens. They do not search for an area {{to create a new}} colony and feed on sap until early July, when <b>they</b> <b>disappear.</b> In other species of Vespa, males also have a chance of being stylopized. The consequences between the two sexes are similar, as neither sex is able to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

25|$|Around 830, {{it became}} a lordship ruled by {{hereditary}} hypati, or consuls: {{the first of these}} was Constantine (839–866), who in 847 aided Pope Leo IV in the naval fight at Ostia. At this same time (846) the episcopal see of Gaeta was founded when Constantine, Bishop of Formiae, fled thither and established his residence. He was associated with his son Marinus I. They were probably violently overthrown (<b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> suddenly from history) in 866 or 867 by Docibilis I, who, looking rather to local safety, entered into treaties with the Saracens and abandoned friendly relations with the papacy. Nevertheless, he greatly expanded the duchy and began construction of the palace. Greatest of the hypati was possibly John I, who helped crush the Saracens at Garigliano in 915 and gained the title of patricius from the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII.|$|E
25|$|Zelena and Arthur are in {{the woods}} and come upon the witch’s home and is met by a giant wolf, only to have Zelena throws some {{sleeping}} powder on it to make it sleepy. The witch appears and says she won’t be as easy to subdue. Arthur asks for the magic helm and the witch says she already sent someone to look for it. Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it. Zelena takes Merida's bow to use as a tracking device, and tells her she can console herself with the memories of what a terrible ruler {{he turned out to be}} then tells Arthur they can use it to track the helm and <b>they</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E

In the video, Songz sees several women along the beach, and plays volleyball with them, walks along the coastline, relaxes on a parked motorcycle, and other things, however in each instance <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> and {{turn out to be}} illusions.

500|$|Specifically, Enough Said {{was praised}} for its {{commitment}} to realism, both in the way Holofcener's characters converse and in the themes the film addresses. In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott claimed that [...] "Line for line, scene for scene, {{it is one of}} the best-written American film comedies in recent memory." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Enough Said demonstrated [...] "Holofcener's gift for portraying life as it is lived", while David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that it [...] "approaches novelistic richness". In The New York Times Book Review, Francine Prose praised Holofcener for having written characters [...] "with sufficient depth and wisdom that ... the actors never seem to be movie stars impersonating people. Rather, <b>they</b> <b>disappear</b> into the vulnerable and self-doubting characters they play without a hint of the preening vanity that so often causes cinematic performances to seem forced and shallow." ...|$|E

The upper segment shows an analog clock displaying the current time. At some points, fireworks were added to maintain the theme. At midnight, the pendulum shatters and the words [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] flip out. The timer debuted on the 2010–11 edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and made a brief appearance in the 2011 movie New Year's Eve.
