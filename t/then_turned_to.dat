5|$|Péladan {{agreed to}} lecture {{in front of}} Societatea Ileana at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was The Genius of the Latin Race. His mystical {{doctrine}} was received with much skepticism and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers. The visit <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.|$|E
5|$|The National Union of Seamen's Strike of 1966 {{damaged the}} already fragile {{finances}} of Cunard, and left Smallpeice with few options. The company, by now {{in need of}} cash, was forced to sell its stake in BOAC-Cunard. Smallpeice <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> strengthening the board and bringing in experts from outwith the company, inviting Stormont Mancroft, 2nd Baron Mancroft, Priscilla Buchan, John Wall and Maxwell Joseph to join the board.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{attended}} {{a series of}} crisis meetings in Chicago with Connant, Groves, Arthur Compton, Kenneth Nichols and Enrico Fermi. It was agreed that the isotopes could not be separated, so high-purity plutonium would not be required. Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team. The Los Alamos laboratory <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the technologically much more difficult task of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|With {{the close}} of the North African {{campaign}} in May 1943, attention <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the European theater of operations. Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the Pacific theater, it was decided that the division, having served with the Eighth Army throughout the desert campaign, would remain in Europe. Accordingly, in October, the division moved to join the Eighth Army in Italy.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E

5|$|After Vatondas, Negroponte {{seemed about}} to fall into Licario's hands too. The city, however, was quickly {{reinforced}} by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian bailo, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except {{for the city of}} Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario's ships raided the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bob was a {{hurricane}} that affected the southeast United States in July 1985. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, the system developed from a tropical wave on July 21 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico. Bob began moving east, striking southwestern Florida as a weak tropical storm. The storm <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the north and quickly intensified to hurricane status on July 24. The next day, it made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina, becoming one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States during a single season. Bob quickly weakened over land, and was absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26.|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E

5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The 1903 Florida {{hurricane}} was an Atlantic hurricane {{that caused}} extensive wind and flood {{damage on the}} Florida peninsula and over the adjourning Southeastern United States in early to mid September 1903. The third tropical cyclone and third hurricane of the season, this storm was first observed near Mayaguana island in the Bahamas early on September9. Moving northwestward, it became a hurricane {{the next day and}} passed near Nassau. The cyclone <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the west-northwest on September 11 and passed just north of the Bimini Islands. As it crossed the Bahamas, the cyclone produced hurricane-force winds that caused damage to crops and buildings, but no deaths were reported over the island chain.|$|E
5|$|The film reunites Bond {{with the}} car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the filmmakers <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the brand new Lotus Esprit in 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the {{submersible}} Lotus however, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 is recognised as {{the most famous of}} his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred {{with the use of}} nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E
5|$|With {{the close}} of the North African {{campaign}} in May 1943, the Allies' attention <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the European Theatre of Operations. Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the Pacific Theatre of Operations, it was decided that the division, having served with the 8th Army throughout the desert campaign would remain in Europe and take part in the fighting in Italy. Having been based in Maadi Camp since early June, the battalion left Egypt on 6 October as part of the division's shift to Italy and reached Taranto three days later.|$|E
5|$|After leaving school, Mühe was {{employed}} as a construction worker and a border guard at the Berlin Wall. He <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> acting, and from the late 1970s into the 1980s appeared in numerous plays, becoming a star of the Deutsches Theater in East Berlin. He was active in politics and denounced Communist rule in East Germany in a memorable address at the Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November 1989 shortly before {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall. After German reunification he continued to appear in a large number of films, television programmes and theatre productions. In Germany he was particularly known for playing the lead role of Dr. Robert Kolmaar in the long-running forensic crime series Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness, 1998–2007).|$|E

5|$|After {{the attackers}} crossed the Norwegian {{coastline}} at 3:40pm, two Beaufighters from No.144 and No.489 Squadrons detached {{themselves from the}} main force and pressed ahead as outriders. The two 'outriders' crossed Førde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50pm they sent Milson a radio message stating {{that they could not}} see the ships. The 'outriders' <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the east and overflew the town of Førde before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near Førde Fjord they did not spot the German warships in their new position. Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.|$|E
5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation and <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men {{and threatened to}} blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; {{although}} the Second Athenian Confederacy was dissolved, the Athenians {{were allowed to}} keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip's motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons. He <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely {{to take advantage of}} the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.|$|E
