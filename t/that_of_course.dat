It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

Konoe replied <b>that,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> negotiations were primary, and the military option was only a fall-back position if negotiations failed. The Emperor then questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the Occident. After Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him, remembering that the Army had predicted that the invasion of China would be completed in only three months.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 39, Gangleri {{asks about}} the food and drinks the Einherjar consume, and asks if only water is {{available}} there. High replies <b>that,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> Valhalla has food and drinks fit for kings and jarls, for the mead consumed in Valhalla is produced from the udders of the goat Heiðrún, who in turn feeds on {{the leaves of the}} [...] "famous tree" [...] Læraðr. The goat produces so much mead in a day that it fills a massive vat large enough for all of the Einherjar in Valhalla to satisfy their thirst from it. High further states that the stag Eikþyrnir stands atop Valhalla and chews on the branches of Læraðr. So much moisture drips from his horns that it falls down to the well Hvelgelmir, resulting in numerous rivers.|$|E
500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, {{is that we have}} so many incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much.

We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' <b>That</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

Milano's albums, which she described as [...] "bubblegum pop", scored platinum in the country, though she later showed her discontent in their musical quality. Subsequently, she starred in the children's film The Canterville Ghost, which did not achieve much praise or attention and Variety magazine noted in its review: [...] "Milano as the catalyzing daughter Jennifer adapts to the ghostly Sir Simon without a qualm; <b>that,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> is the true charm of the story, but Milano doesn't exhibit enough presence to match the droll, charming Gielgud".|$|E

2500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} this episode {{is the creation of}} another Doctor. Unlike the multiple Doctors of stories such as The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and The Two Doctors, where his previous incarnations were played by actors or depicted in old footage, this Doctor is identical in appearance to the Tenth Doctor. In the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential for this episode, Davies explains [...] "This is so busy and so mental and so epic and universal in scale <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> you need two Doctors to solve it." [...] Phil Collinson, Graeme Harper, and David Tennant discuss the use of the double, a musician named Colum Regan who is a very good physical match for Tennant.

[...] No such response was expected, however, and since Truman had canceled his own cease-fire initiative, operations in strength above the 38th parallel again had become a tactical question for General MacArthur and General Ridgway to answer. MacArthur, in fact, publicly revealed his answer before he really knew that the diplomatic effort to achieve a cease-fire had been canceled. Upon his return to Tokyo late on March 24 following his conference with Ridgway and {{a visit to the}} front, he announced that he had directed the Eighth Army to cross the parallel [...] "if and when its security makes it tactically advisable.

2500|$|Variety {{magazine}} wrote {{a scathing}} advance review that appeared on July 16, 2006. Common {{complaints about the}} film were that little effort was put into getting the viewer {{to believe in the}} world, that few moments of the film could be taken seriously, and that Shyamalan was using the film as a form of self-indulgence; instead of having a minor cameo, as in most of his films, Shyamalan cast himself as a visionary whose writing changes the world, and another character included a film critic— portrayed by actor Bob Balaban as arrogant, self-assured, and passive— who comes to a violent end. Many reviewers attacked this perceived self-indulgence: Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote of the story, [...] "Apparently those who live in the water now roam the earth trying to make us listen, though initially it’s rather foggy as to what precisely we are supposed to hear—the crash of the waves, the songs of the sirens, the voice of God—until we realize <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> we're meant to cup our ear to an even higher power: Mr. Shyamalan." ...|$|E
