5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects.

500|$|An {{association}} between circumcision and reduced heterosexual HIV infection rates was suggested in 1986. [...] Experimental evidence {{was needed to}} establish a causal relationship, so three randomized controlled trials were commissioned {{as a means to}} reduce the effect of any confounding factors.

All three trials were stopped early by their monitoring boards on ethical grounds because those in the circumcised group had a lower rate of HIV contraction <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Subsequently, the World Health Organization promoted circumcision in high-risk populations as part of an overall program to reduce the spread of HIV, although some have challenged the validity of the African randomized controlled trials, prompting a number of researchers to question the effectiveness of circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy. The Male Circumcision Clearinghouse website was formed in 2009 by WHO, UNAIDS, FHI and AVAC to provide current evidence-based guidance, information, and resources to support the delivery of safe male circumcision services in countries that choose to scale up the procedure as one component of comprehensive HIV prevention services.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic modulatory neuron, nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory was assessed using cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term memory trace was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the feeding rates between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hydrogen (H 2), {{a potent}} free radical scavenger, {{selectively}} reduces the hydroxyl radical, {{which is the}} most cytotoxic of the reactive oxygen species (ROS). An increase in oxygen free radicals induces oxidative stress, which is known {{to be involved in the}} development of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, we investigated whether hydrogen-rich water (HRW) affects metabolic abnormalities in the metabolic syndrome rat model, SHR. Cg- Lepr cp /NDmcr (SHR-cp). Methods Male SHR-cp rats (5 weeks old) were divided into 2 groups: an HRW group was given oral HRW for 16 weeks, and a <b>control</b> <b>group</b> was given distilled water. At the end of the experiment, each rat was placed in a metabolic cage for 24 h, fasted for 12 h, and anesthetized; the blood and kidneys were then collected. Results Sixteen weeks after HRW administration, the water intake and urine flow measured in the metabolic cages were significantly higher in <b>the</b> HRW <b>group</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> urinary ratio of albumin to creatinine was significantly lower and creatinine clearance was higher in <b>the</b> HRW <b>group</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> After <b>the</b> 12 -h fast, plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine in the HRW group were significantly lower <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> plasma total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in <b>the</b> HRW <b>group</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> <b>The</b> glomerulosclerosis score for the HRW group was significantly lower <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> and a significantly positive correlation was observed between this score and plasma urea nitrogen levels.

2500|$|The {{intensity}} of aphasia therapy {{is determined by}} the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding. The review found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).|$|E
2500|$|Differences in sex-dependent {{behavior}} {{observed in}} infected hosts compared to non-infected individuals {{can be attributed}} to differences in testosterone. Infected males had higher levels of testosterone while infected females had significantly lower levels, compared to their non-infected equivalents. Looking at humans, studies using the Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor questionnaire found that infected men scored lower on Factor G (superego strength/rule consciousness) and higher on Factor L (vigilance) while the opposite pattern was observed for infected women. This means that men were more likely to disregard rule and were more expedient, suspicious and jealous. On the other hand, women were more warm hearted, outgoing, conscientious and moralistic. Mice infected with T. gondii have a worse motor performance than non-infected mice. Thus, a computerized simple reaction test was given to both infected and non-infected adults. It was found that the infected adults performed much more poorly and lost their concentration more quickly <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> But, the effect of the infection only explains less than 10% of the variability in performance. (i.e., there could be other confounding factors) Correlation has also been observed between seroprevalence of T. gondii in humans and increased risk of traffic accidents. Infected subjects have a 2.65 times higher risk of getting into a traffic accident. A similar study done in Turkey showed that there is a higher incidence of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies among drivers who have been involved in traffic accidents. Furthermore, this parasite has been associated with many neurological disorders such as schizophrenia. In a meta-analysis, 23 studies met inclusion criteria. The results demonstrate that the seroprevalence of antibodies to T. gondii in people with schizophrenia is significantly higher than in control populations (OR=2.73, P<0.000001). More recent studies found that suicide attempters has significantly higher IgG antibody levels to T. gondii than patients without a suicide attempt. Infection was also shown to be associated with suicide in women over the age of 60. (P<0.005) ...|$|E
