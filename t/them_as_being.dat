5|$|The first {{mention of}} the ring-tailed lemur in Western {{literature}} came in 1625 when English traveler and writer Samuel Purchas described <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> comparable in size to a monkey and having a fox-like long tail with black and white rings.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached {{a peak of}} fifteen selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success reaching a peak of fourteen on the chart. Cannibal was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{might never}} have been ruled jointly by Alberht and Beonna. It is {{generally}} accepted that Alberht and the later Æthelberht II, who ruled East Anglia {{until his death in}} 794, are different kings, but the historian D. P. Kirby has identified <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> one person. According to Kirby, Beonna might have ascended the throne in around 758 and the issuing of his coins could indicate that East Anglia broke free of Mercian domination for a time, so linking Beonna's reign with the eventual disintegration of Mercian hegemony that occurred after Æthelbald's death.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E

5|$|Description of {{an early}} form of yoga called nirodhayoga (yoga of cessation) is {{contained}} in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (Self) is realized. Terms like vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{moved to}} Manchester City on 30 January 2006 {{for a fee}} of £6million, a record for a Greek player. He was given the number 20 shirt. Samaras stated that he was excited about moving to Manchester City, because he saw <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the next stage in his development. He {{also said that he}} would relish being in a team with the likes of David James, Andy Cole, and Trevor Sinclair. He made his debut for City on 1 February, as a 65th-minute {{replacement}} for Cole in a 3–0 home win against Newcastle United. His first goal for the club came in the following home match, against Charlton Athletic. The following month Samaras scored in a 2–1 home win against Aston Villa, to put City through to the quarter-finals of the League Cup. This was his fourth goal in six appearances. Samaras scored one further goal that season, in a 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Veronica gets an {{invitation}} to Norris's house, but she doesn't find any weapons. Veronica calls Mac to help her break into the WiFi before she sees Pete {{in front of the}} house. The ATF searches Norris's vehicle and finds fertilizer and a rifle, despite Veronica's convictions that he is not the perpetrator. However, Veronica recognizes <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> the same ones Ben was loading into his car earlier. Veronica calls Pete, and she tells him that she knows he falsely implicated Norris (with the help of the ATF agent) because of terrible bullying in junior high. Meg tells Veronica that Duncan has disappeared after removing $10,000 from the bank. The story involving Norris is published in the newspaper, and, although it leads to all charges against Norris being dropped, it also results in the new journalism teacher's (Joey Lauren Adams) termination.|$|E

60|$|Sir Rudolph {{was a man}} of forty, {{tall and}} dark, with Norman features. He held the Saxons in utter contempt, and treated <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>beings</b> solely created to till the land for the benefit of their Norman lords. He was brave and fearless, and {{altogether}} free from the superstition of the times. Even the threats of the pope, which although Prince John defied them yet terrified him at heart, were derided by his follower, who feared no one thing in the world, save, perhaps, the return of King Richard from captivity.|$|R

From the admiral, it is true, they had experienced nothing but just and gentle treatment, and continual benefits; and the idea of his immediate influence with the Deity, manifested on the memorable occasion of the eclipse, may have made <b>them</b> consider him <b>as</b> more than human, and his presence as propitious to their island; but {{it is not easy to}} believe that a lawless gang like that of Porras, could have been ranging for months among their villages, without giving cause for the greatest joy at their departure.|$|R

25|$|In July 1949, {{the city}} council {{approved}} a plan by the Birmingham COPEC Housing Improvement Society Ltd. to construct twenty flats for single women in Cob Lane. The council had been against flats initially as they had seen <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> unnecessary for their cost. However, as Birmingham's population expanded {{and the demand for}} housing increased, the idea of building flats and maisonettes across the city became more popular. Eventually, {{the city council}} acknowledged that there was a need for flats and started a programme to provide such properties for Birmingham's citizens.|$|E
