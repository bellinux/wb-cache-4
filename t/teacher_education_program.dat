5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made {{the transition from a}} private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} on technology integration and <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> shows that <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> are not adequately preparing students to integrate technology. This study focused on three <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> {{across the country that}} have acquired a reputation among their peers for having successfully integrated technology into their programs. In order to gain a deeper understanding, three research questions guided the research: (1) What are the contemporary realities of technology and <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in the three programs? (2) What are the affordances and constraints around technology integration in the three programs? and (3) What working infrastructure has been established in <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> as potential affordances for technology integration? To answer these research questions, multiple case study techniques were incorporated. Qualitative data were collected through site visits at three <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> Data sources included observations, in-depth semi-structured interviews with faculty, staff, and students, and examinations of documents and artifacts related to technology. The three case studies played a vital part in understanding which technology integration model succeeded and did not succeed. By using qualitative research methodology, this study provided more lively and convincing stories and perspectives of technology and <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> 	This study described the contemporary realities of technology and <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs,</b> the affordances and constraints around technology integration, and the process of creating a working infrastructure in <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> as potential affordances for technology integration. The commitment to integrate technology in the programs was an evolving process. <b>Teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> continuously sought better ways to implement technology integration. One consistent finding across all programs was the lack of technology integration throughout the programs. There were strong attempts to integrate technology across the programs through a required technology course or digital portfolio construction and laptop initiative. Cases of integration of technology existed; however, it stayed at the individual level. Several affordances and constraints, ranging from organizational to personal constraints, have contributed to the general failure to integrate technology throughout the <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> In particular, levels of technology integration, administrative support, funding, technical support, technology access, and faculty development have influenced or hindered technology integration in the <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the perception of faculty members and public officers about the indicators for accreditation of <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the indicators for accreditation of <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in Thailand. A total of 145 administrators and faculties of the higher education institutions in Thailand (HEIs) and staffs of Office of the Higher Education Commission (OHEC) participated in this study. Online survey questionnaire was used to collect the data which was described the important indicators using for accreditation of <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in Thailand. The accreditation indicators of <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> consisted of 5 domains, namely, institutional context, program design, program delivery, program outcomes and quality assurance.

25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> in Croatia. Prior to evaluation of the primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs,</b> expected primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> competencies were defined. The expected teacher competencies were determined according to the goals stated in the Croatian national curriculum. In addition, international guidelines for information literacy development among primary <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> were used. An extensive literature review on information literacy curriculum in <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> higher education was conducted as a part of this study. The evaluation of primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> is conducted according to the content analysis methodology. Since current primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> do not state learning outcomes, future teacher competences are evaluated according to the state course goals. The content analysis indicates that the majority of the current primary <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> include goals that could be linked to information literacy standards. Future teachers are most frequently taught how to evaluate information, but lack instruction on fair use of information. The discussion includes recommendations to raise information literacy among teacher educators and to align course syllabi with the common theoretical frameworks. </p...|$|R

25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>program</b> at a college/university {{and hold a}} master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|When Lyndon State College {{relocated}} {{to its new}} home {{on the top of}} Vail Hill in 1951, the library that had been at the nearby Lyndon Institute (where the college began as a <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>program)</b> was moved to Vail Manor and housed in one of the mansion's twin towers. Twelve thousand volumes were moved by hand in one weekend. In 1965, the library expanded into its own building in what is now the Harvey Academic Center. Lyndon Professor Emeritus and Vermont state senator Graham S. Newell selected Samuel Read Hall as the library’s namesake. In 1972, the current library building was opened, and in 1980, the building won a design award from the American Institute of Architects for being a “bridge” from one side of campus to the other. By 1994, however, the library and the college had both outgrown their space, and so {{the decision was made to}} expand the library building into what would become known as the Library Academic Center, or LAC. The renovated building, which opened in 1995, added one floor of library space and one floor of classrooms.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} recent {{research}} on program features that characterize powerful <b>teacher</b> <b>education.</b> This {{research suggests that}} <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> <b>programs</b> need to promote a clear vision of teachers and teaching; must be coherent, reflecting a shared understanding {{of teaching and learning}} among faculty and students; and finally, need to be built around a strong core curriculum deeply tied to teaching practice.
