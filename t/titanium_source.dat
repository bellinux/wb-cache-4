[...] Records found after the accident indicated that two rough-machined forgings having the serial number of the crash disk had been routed through GEAE manufacturing. Records indicated that Alcoa supplied GE with TIMET titanium forgings for one disk with the serial number of the crash disk.

The FAA report stated “There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”. [...] GE records of the second disk having the serial number of the crash disk indicate that it was made with an RMI titanium billet supplied by Alcoa.

GE records indicate that final finishing and inspection of the crash disk were completed on December 11, 1971. Alcoa records indicate that this RMI titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts.

TiO 2 is a particular photocatalyst, It is stable, without toxicity and inexpensive, but TiO 2 with relatively wide forbidden band, only responses to the ultraviolet light that accounts for 3 % ~ 5 % from sunlight, so its utilization rate of the sun is very low, which limit its industrial applications. And now, the modification of TiO 2 in the visible region has become an important issue in the field of photocatalysis research activity.

40|$|We {{present a}} green, {{biological}} production route for silica-titania photocatalysts using diatom microalgae. Diatoms are single-celled, eukaryotic microalgae (2 - 2000 mu m) that self-assemble soluble silicon (Si(OH) (4)) into intricate silica cell walls, called frustules. These diatom frustules are formed under ambient conditions and consist of hydrated silica with specific 3 D morphologies and micro-meso or macroporosity. A remarkable characteristic of diatoms is {{their ability to}} bioaccumulate soluble titanium from cell culture medium and incorporate them into their nanostructured silica cell wall. Controlled cultivation of the diatom Pinnularia sp. on soluble titanium in a batch process resulted in the biological immobilisation of titanium dioxide in the porous 3 D architecture of the frustules. Six different <b>titanium</b> <b>sources</b> are tested. The silica-titania frustules were isolated by treating the harvested Pinnularia cells with nitric acid (65 %) or by high temperature treatment. Thermal annealing converted the amorphous titania into crystalline titania. The produced silica-titania material is evaluated towards photocatalytic activity for acetaldehyde (C 2 H 4 O) abatement. Frustules cultivated with TiBaldH showed the highest photocatalytic performance. Comparison of the photocatalytic activity with P 25 reveals that P 25 has a 4 fold higher photocatalytic activity, but when photocatalytic activity is normalized for titania content, the frustules show double activity. Further material characterization (morphology, crystallinity, surface area and elemental distribution) of the TiBaldH silica-titania frustules provides additional insight into their structure-activity relationship.

30|$|Molten salt {{synthesis}} (MSS) {{method is}} {{an effective way to}} prepare perovskite oxide electronic ceramic powders, which involves molten salt used as the medium for synthesizing pure perovskite oxides from their constituent materials (oxides and carbonates) at a relatively low temperature and in a shorter reaction time as compared with the conventional solid-state reactions [13]. Recently, perovskite PTO powders are synthesized by molten flux reaction using NaCl and NaCl-KCl as the reaction media [14 – 16]. The formation of spherical PTO powders was achieved by the dissolved PbO diffusing onto the TiO 2 surface in the molten salts and reacting in-situ to form PTO nanoparticles, and then following the nucleation and growth of PTO nanoparticles. As compared with the PTO powders, the synthesis of PTO 1 D nanomaterials (e.g., nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes) by MSS method has lingered far behind. The main reason is due to the challenges in synthesizing high-quality PTO 1 D nanomaterials because the high symmetry of the perovskite structure can easily lead to PTO growing into a cubic block. To date, only a few works about the synthesis of PTO 1 D nanomaterials by MSS method are available in the literature. Deng et al. [17] synthesized PTO nanorods with diameters of 50 – 80 [*]nm and lengths of a few micrometers at 700 [*]°C by using a surfactant (polyoxyethylene (9) nonylphenyl ether, NP- 9)-assisted approach in a NaCl molten salt medium. The growth of the PTO nanorods was attributed to the dispersion of fine PTO nanoparticles and their re-deposition on larger particles, leading to the formation of nanorods along the axial direction under the combination effects of NP- 9 surfactant and flux of NaCl. Cai et al. [15] reported on the synthesis of single-crystalline PTO nanorods with diameters of 0.1 – 1.0 [*]μm and lengths of up to a few micrometers by template MSS method, where NP- 9 was used as a surfactant and the rod-shaped TiO 2 precursors were used as the templates for <b>titanium</b> <b>sources.</b> The size and morphology of the rod-shaped TiO 2 templates were retained in the synthesized PTO particles. Similarly, needle-like PTO powders were also synthesized via template MSS method, where pure needle-like TiO 2 particles were used as the templates [18].

All the materials prepared with various nSi/nTi ratios exhibit well-ordered porous structure and possess high BET surface areas (673 - 941 m 2 g- 1) and large pore volumes (0. 46 - 0. 71 cm 3 g- 1). The pore diameter of the samples also increases with increasing the Ti content in the samples. UV-vis results confirm that most of the Ti atoms are in the tetrahedral co-ordination. Finally, the materials are subjected to cyclohexene epoxidation using TBHP/H 2 O 2 as oxidant and acetonitrile as solvent in order to investigate their catalytic activity. Ti-KIT- 5 samples display a high catalytic activity with TBHP as oxidant and remain inactive when H 2 O 2 was used. The amount of Ti plays a crucial role in controlling the catalytic activity of the samples. Of the catalysts studied, Ti-KIT- 5 (5) where the number in the parenthesis indicates the Si/Ti ratio shows the best activity, affording a high conversion to cyclohexene.

The phase transformation has first been studied experimentally by combining X-ray diffraction analysis, electrical resistivity and microscopy observations. From a series of isothermal treatments, a IT diagram has been determined, which {{takes into account the}} different morphologies. Then, a Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) model has been successfully used to describe the phase transformation kinetics during either isothermal or cooling treatments. Finally, the coupling of the JMAK model to the finite element software ZeBuLoN allowed us to investigate the evolution of the spatial distribution of the different morphologies during the cooling of an aircraft engine shaft disk after forging...|$|R
30|$|Titanium(IV) {{fluoride}} (TiF 4; 98 %, Shanghai Darui Chemicals Co. Ltd., Shanghai, People' Republic of China) {{was used}} in this study as the precursor to provide both <b>titanium</b> and fluorine <b>sources.</b> Tert-butanol (C 4 H 10 O; ≥ 98 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, People' Republic of China) was used as the solvent in the solvent-thermal process. Thiourea (CH 4 N 2 S; ≥ 99 %, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was used to provide nitrogen and sulfur sources in the calcination process. Commercially available Degussa P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany) were used for the comparison with nitrogen/sulfur co-doped TiO 2 nanocrystals with highly active { 001 } facets on their visible-light photocatalytic performance.|$|R

We investigated {{the effects of}} reaction time, temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, organic/aqueous phase ratio, TOA concentration, and titanium concentration on the removal efficiency of titanium(IV). The results show {{that it is possible}} to recover over 99 % of titanium(IV) after 15 min reaction time by TOA from the sulfuric acid solution under the optimum operation conditions and the loading capacity of TOA for titanium (IV) is 30 g Ti(IV) / 100 g TOA. We expect that results studied would be applicable to separate and concentrate <b>titanium</b> from secondary <b>sources</b> such as red mud produced in the aluminum/alumina industry...|$|R
