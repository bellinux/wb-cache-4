It is important when choosing a flow meter technology for a specific application. If a gas flow to be measured is expected to vary between 100,000 m³ per day and 1,000,000 m³ per day, the specific application has a <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of at 10:1. Therefore the meter requires a <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of at least 10:1. For example: if the meter had an advertised maximum flow of 2,000,000 m³ per day then the required <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> would be 20:1.|$|E

40|$|Upcoming crewed space {{missions}} {{will involve}} large {{internal and external}} heat loads and require advanced thermal control systems to maintain a desired internal environment temperature. Radiators with at least 12 : 1 <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> (the ratio between the maximum and minimum heat rejection rates) will be needed. However, current technologies are only able to achieve <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> of approximately 3 : 1. A morphing radiator capable of altering shape could significantly increase turndown capabilities. Shape memory alloys offer qualities that may be well suited for this endeavor; their temperature-dependent phase changes could offer radiators the ability to passively control heat rejection. In 2015, a morphing radiator prototype was constructed and tested in a thermal vacuum environment, where it successfully demonstrated the morphing behavior and variable heat rejection. Newer composite prototypes have since been designed and manufactured using two distinct types of SMA materials. These models underwent temperature cycling tests in a thermal vacuum chamber {{and a series of}} fatigue tests to characterize the lifespan of these designs. The focus {{of this paper is to}} present the design approach and testing of the morphing composite facesheet.

40|$|In {{order to}} control system and {{component}} temperatures, many spacecraft thermal control systems use a radiator {{coupled with a}} pumped fluid loop to reject waste heat from the vehicle. Since heat loads and radiation environments can vary considerably according to mission phase, the thermal control system {{must be able to}} vary the heat rejection. The ability to "turn down" the heat rejected from the thermal control system is critically important when designing the system. Electrochromic technology as a radiator coating is being investigated to vary the amount of heat rejected by a radiator. Coupon level tests were performed to test the feasibility of this technology. Furthermore, thermal math models were developed to better understand the <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> required by full scale radiator architectures to handle the various operation scenarios encountered during a mission profile for the Altair Lunar Lander. This paper summarizes results from coupon level tests as well as the thermal math models developed to investigate how electrochromics can be used to increase turn down ratios for a radiator. Data from the various design concepts of radiators and their architectures are outlined. Recommendations are made on which electrochromic radiator concept should be carried further for future thermal vacuum testing...|$|R

50|$|Boiler <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} of maximum heat output to the minimum level of heat output at which the boiler will operate {{efficiently}} or controllably. Many boilers are designed to operate {{at a variety of}} output levels. As the desired temperature/pressure point is approached, the heat source is progressively turned down. If pressure/temperature falls, the heat source is progressively turned up. If a boiler application requires it to operate at a low proportion of its maximum output, a high <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> is required. Conversely, in applications where the operational conditions are not expected to vary significantly (for example, a large power plant), a low <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> will be sufficient.|$|E

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{development of}} the residential combustion system {{is divided into three}} phases. Only Phase I is detailed here. Phase I constitutes the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a pulse combustor sized for residential space heating. Phase II is an optional phase to develop an integrated system including a heat exchanger. Phase III is projected as a field test of the integrated coal-fired residential space heater. The Phase I effort was nearing completion during this reporting period and a final report is in preparation. The configuration testing was completed early in the period and based upon results of the configuration tests, an optimized configuration for the experimental development testing was chosen. The refractory-lined chambers were fabricated and tested from mid-September through early October. The tandem unit was operated on dry micromized coal without support gas or excitation air for periods lasting from one to three hours. Performance was stable and <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> of 3 : 1 were achieved during the first three-hour test. A early commercial residential heating system configuration has been identified {{on the basis of the}} development testing conducted throughout the first phase of this effort. The development effort indicates that the residential unit goals are achievable with some additional product improvement effort to increase carbon burn-out efficiency, reduce CO emissions and develop a reliable and compact dry, ultrafine coal feed system (not included in the present effort) ...|$|R
40|$|To enhance fuel efficiency, future {{advanced}} small {{gas turbine}} engines will utilize engine cycles calling for overall engine pressure ratios, leading to higher combustor inlet pressures and temperatures. Further, {{the temperature rise}} through the combustor and the corresponding exit temperature are also expected to increase. This report describes future combustor technology needs for small gas turbine engines. New fuel injectors with large <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> which produce uniform circumferential and radial temperature patterns will be required. Uniform burning will be of greater importance because hot gas temperatures will approach turbine material limits. The higher combustion temperatures and increased radiation at high pressures will put a greater heat load on the combustor liners. At the same time, less cooling air will be available as more of the air {{will be used for}} combustion. Thus, improved cooling concepts and/or materials requiring little or no direct cooling will be required. Although presently there are no requirements for emissions levels from small gas turbine engines, regulation is anticipated in the near future. This will require the development of low emission combustors. In particular, nitrogen oxides will increase substantially if new technologies limiting their formation are not evolved and implemented. For example, staged combustion employing lean, premixed/prevaporized, lean direct injection, or rich burn-quick quench-lean burn concepts could replace conventional single stage combustors. Due to combustor size considerations, staged combustion is more easily accommodated in large engines. The inclusion of staged combustion in small engines will pose greater combustor design challenges...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was to further {{the development of an}} electromechanically controlled variable-orifice nozzle by creating an electronic control system and then evaluating that system based on step and ramp inputs. The control system was developed in a programming environment that combined an electronic data acquisition system and actuator with pressure and flow sensors. A proportional, variable-gain (based on system pressure) control system was developed to adjust nozzle flow rates to meet target application rates. The constraints were to achieve settling time of less than 1. 0 s, overshoot of less than 10 % of maximum flow (or minimum flow), and average absolute steady-state error of less than 2 %. After several trials, the resulting control system achieved these objectives for full steps from maximum and minimum flow rates (and vice versa) at carrier pressures from 140 to 410 kPa. Ramp response analyses revealed the maximum flow rate change (mL s- 2) of the nozzle control system. Operation was considered successful if the average absolute error was less than 5 % and the average absolute error + 2 σ did not exceed 10 % of the desired flow, thereby ensuring that the nozzle operated within specifications 95 % of the time. An additional goal was to maintain nozzle response lag times of less than 1. 0 s based on input rate changes in the form of ramp signal input frequencies. Lag times were found to be less than 0. 5 s (± 0. 05 s) over the carrier pressure range at input frequencies of up to 0. 2 Hz. Further, these results indicated that for each carrier pressure, a maximum rate change frequency of 0. 07 Hz ensured that system errors were within the design requirements. Lag times at this frequency were less than 0. 38 s for all carrier pressures tested. The range of rate change achieved by the nozzle control system ranged from 2. 97 to 6. 39 mL s- 2 for carrier pressures of 140 to 414 kPa, respectively. Thus, as operating pressure increased, the nozzle was capable of compensating for greater changes in the desired flow rate. While the <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios</b> (~ 2. 4 : 1) over the range of carrier pressures were essentially stable, flow rates increased with carrier pressure...|$|R

40|$|The Next Generation Turbine (NGT) Program's {{technological}} development {{focused on a}} study of the feasibility of turbine systems greater than 30 MW that offer improvement over the 1999 state-of-the-art systems. This program targeted goals of 50 percent <b>turndown</b> <b>ratios,</b> 15 percent reduction in generation cost/kW hour, improved service life, reduced emissions, 400 starts/year with 10 minutes to full load, and multiple fuel usage. Improvement in reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM), while reducing operations, maintenance, and capital costs by 15 percent, was pursued. This program builds on the extensive low emissions stationary gas turbine work being carried out by Pratt & Whitney (P&W) for P&W Power Systems (PWPS), which is a company {{under the auspices of the}} United Technologies Corporation (UTC). This study was part of the overall Department of Energy (DOE) NGT Program that extends out to the year 2008. A follow-on plan for further full-scale component hardware testing is conceptualized for years 2002 through 2008 to insure a smooth and efficient transition to the marketplace for advanced turbine design and cycle technology. This program teamed the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), P&W, United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), kraftWork Systems Inc., a subcontractor on-site at UTRC, and Multiphase Power and Processing Technologies (MPPT), an off-site subcontractor. Under the auspices of the NGT Program, a series of analyses were performed to identify the NGT engine system's ability to serve multiple uses. The majority were in conjunction with a coal-fired plant, or used coal as the system fuel. Identified also was the ability of the NGT system to serve as the basis of an advanced performance cycle: the humid air turbine (HAT) cycle. The HAT cycle is also used with coal gasification in an integrated cycle HAT (IGHAT). The NGT systems identified were: (1) Feedwater heating retrofit to an existing coal-fired steam plant, which could supply both heat and peaking power (Block 2 engine); (2) Repowering of an older coal-fired plant (Block 2 engine); (3) Gas-fired HAT cycle (Block 1 and 2 engines); (4) Integrated gasification HAT (Block 1 and 2 engines). Also under Phase I of the NGT Program, a conceptual design of the combustion system has been completed. An integrated approach to cycle optimization for improved combustor turndown capability has been employed. The configuration selected has the potential for achieving single digit NO{sub x}/CO emissions between 40 percent and 100 percent load conditions. A technology maturation plan for the combustion system has been proposed. Also, as a result of Phase I, ceramic vane technology will be incorporated into NGT designs and will require less cooling flow than conventional metallic vanes, thereby improving engine efficiency. A common 50 Hz and 60 Hz power turbine was selected due to the cost savings from eliminating a gearbox. A list of ceramic vane technologies has been identified for which the funding comes from DOE, NASA, the U. S. Air Force, and P&W...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the task reported herein was to define, evaluate, and optimize variable geometry concepts suitable for use with a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor. The specific intent was to identify approaches that would satisfy High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) cycle operational requirements with regard to fuel-air <b>ratio</b> <b>turndown</b> capability, ignition, and stability margin without compromising the stringent emissions, performance, and reliability goals that this combustor would have to achieve.

50|$|The <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{each type}} of meter is limited by {{theoretical}} considerations and by practical considerations.

50|$|Ultrasonic meters are high-cost {{and work}} best with no liquids present {{at all in}} the {{measured}} gas, so they are primarily used in high-flow, high-pressure applications such as utility pipeline meter stations, where the gas is always dry and lean, and where small proportional inaccuracies are intolerable due to the large amount of money at stake. The <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of an ultrasonic meter is probably the largest of any natural gas meter type, and the accuracy and range ability of a high-quality ultrasonic meter is actually greater than that of the turbine meters against which they are proven.|$|E
50|$|If {{the heating}} plant is only {{working at a}} small {{fraction}} of its maximum and the <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> is too low, at some point the burner will still need to be shut off when the desired pressure/temperature is achieved. This in turn leads to a rapid reduction in temperature/pressure, requiring the boiler to restart. Cycling frequency can be as high as 12 times per hour. This is undesirable, as flue gases are purged during both the shut-down and start-up phases, leading to energy losses and therefore inefficiency. Additionally, typical startup times for boilers are in the order of one to two minutes, leading to an inability to respond to sudden load demands.|$|E

Condensing oil boilers are fairly unusual; the condensate from the combustion of oil is far more aggressive than gas, mainly due to sulphur content. These days oil companies are reducing sulphur content of oil on environmental grounds, so this may change. However due to problem of mixing the oil and air, turndown ratios of greater than four are uncommon.|$|E
40|$|Fluidized bed {{combustion}} {{has grown}} {{with the prospect}} that it can burn coal and low grade fuels in an environmentally acceptable manner. Among the technical problems that exist, however, is the inherent inability to produce large variations in heat transfer rate from the fluidized bed. Generally, changes in heat transfer rate (load turndown control) by conventional means are modest and are accompanied by degradation in combustion;The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate a new concept in fluidized bed design that improves load turndown capability. Load <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> is defined as the ratio of maximum to minimum fuel firing rates. Load turndown improvement was accomplished by independently controlling heat transfer and combustion in the combustor. The design consisted of two fluidized beds: one central and one annular bed. The central bed served as the combustion bed. The annular bed was fluidized separately from the combustion bed and its level of fluidization determined the overall heat transfer rate from the combustion bed to a surrounding water jacket. Simple theoretical considerations suggested a load <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> exceeding ten was possible for this design;A computational model consisting of energy and mass balances and a simple combustion kinetics model for the two-bed combustor were developed to predict the detailed performance of the combustor and to assist {{in the design of the}} unit. Combustion tests were performed in an optimally-designed combustor. Three coal-based fuel forms were used: crushed coal, coal-limestone briquettes, and coal-water-limestone mixture (CWLM). A load <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12. 3 was obtained while burning crushed coal. Slightly lower turndowns were obtained for briquettes and CWLM. Sulfur dioxide emission reductions ranging from 42 % to 93 % were observed for a fuel calcium-to-sulfur molar ratio of 2. 0. For most tests, emissions of NO[subscript] x and SO[subscript] 2 met EPA New Source Performance Standards.

The technology had to be demonstrated {{to be at a}} TRL of 2 - 3, with a plan to advance it to a TRL 5 - 6. Here, we show that the concept recently developed in our laboratory, namely the pinned-contact, double droplet switch made by overfilling a hole drilled in a suitable substrate can be implemented with a low-melting temperature metal. When toggled near a second substrate, a liquid bridge can be reversibly connected or disconnected, on demand. We have shown experimentally that liquid-metal bridge switches can be made from gallium with a suitable choice of substrate materials, activation strategies, and control techniques. Individual as well as arrays of gallium bridge switches were shown to be feasible and can be robustly controlled. The very short response time of the bridge connection and disconnection (on the order of 1 millisecond) provides for utility {{in a wide range of}} applications. The liquid bridge switches may be controlled actively or passively. We have shown through computations and analysis that liquid bridge switches provide locally large turndown ratios (on the order of 103 : 1), so a relatively sparse packing of them would be needed to obtain the desired <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 : 1. For the laboratory demonstrations, pressure activation was utilized. Simple designs for a passive control strategy are presented which are highly attractive for several reasons, including i) large <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio,</b> ii) no solid-moving parts, and iii) stable operation. Finally, we note that passive systems do not require any electronics for their control. This along with the relatively small molecular weight of candidate materials for the system, makes for a robust design outside of Earth?s magnetic field, where spacecraft are subject to significant radiation bombardment...|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft {{designed}} for missions beyond {{low earth orbit}} (LEO) face a difficult thermal control challenge, {{particularly in the case}} of crewed vehicles where the thermal control system (TCS) must maintain a relatively constant internal environment temperature despite a vastly varying external thermal environment and despite heat rejection needs that are contrary to the potential of the environment. A thermal control system is in other words required to reject a higher heat load to warm environments and a lower heat load to cold environments, necessitating a quite high <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio.</b> A modern thermal control system is capable of a <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of on the order of 12 : 1, but for crew safety and environment compatibility these are massive multi-loop fluid systems. This paper discusses the analysis of a unique radiator design which employs the behavior of shape memory alloys (SMA) to vary the turndown of, and thus enable, a single-loop vehicle thermal control system for space exploration vehicles. This design, a morphing radiator, varies its shape in response to facesheet temperature to control view of space and primary surface emissivity. Because temperature dependence is inherent to SMA behavior, the design requires no accommodation for control, instrumentation, nor power supply in order to operate. Thermal and radiation modeling of the morphing radiator predict a turndown ranging from 11. 9 : 1 to 35 : 1 independent of TCS configuration. Stress and deformation analyses predict the desired morphing behavior of the concept. A system level mass analysis shows that by enabling a single loop architecture this design could reduce the TCS mass by between 139 kg and 225 kg. The concept is demonstrated in proof-of-concept benchtop tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} the flow rate, spray pattern, and droplet spectra characteristics of an actively controlled variable-orifice nozzle at constant carrier pressures. A commercially available variable- orifice nozzle (VariTarget) was modified to allow for direct electromechanical control of the metering stem. The modified system was tested at five carrier pressures ranging from 138 to 414 kPa and five metering stem (and thus orifice) positions. The metering stem position range was chosen because it provided a linear response in flow rate at each carrier pressure. Flow rate testing indicated a <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2. 4 : 1 at each carrier pressure, with a total <b>turndown</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4. 8 : 1 across the range of carrier pressures using the selected metering stem positions. Spray pattern testing indicated acceptable coefficients of variation for the metering stem positions and carrier pressures for nozzle spacings of 38. 1 and 51. 0 cm. Droplet spectra test results showed that the particle sizes remained in the range of extremely coarse to ultra coarse for all metering stem positions and carrier pressures. Orifice control using the modified system resulted in slightly larger droplet sizes compared to the original spring-actuated nozzle; however, the potential for spray drift would be reduced. The results of this study show that active control of the VT nozzle metering stem could provide potential for improvements in pesticide application. Nozzle flow rates could be controlled via the proposed system with little negative effects on spray pattern or droplet spectra. In addition to compensating for sprayer ground speed changes, a system consisting of these nozzles could potentially be used to solve application errors generated from sprayer turning movements...|$|E
