[...] Kirkus Reviews criticized the book, saying [...] "What the author dramatically fails to provide by bearing down on the negative (to the extent that nearly all his informants denounce est and its founder) is any real understanding of est's teachings--and of why they appealed so deeply to so many." [...] Paul S. Boyer, {{professor of history at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, reviewed the book in The Washington Post. Boyer wrote that the book [...] "nicely recounts the bizarre tale" [...] of Werner Erhard, saying [...] "Pressman tells his fascinating story well." [...] However he also commented that the book gives [...] "only the sketchiest historical context" [...] of est and its roots in societal experiences.|$|E

2500|$|Photojournalism works {{within the}} same ethical {{approaches}} <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> that are applied by other journalists. What to shoot, how to frame and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment {{is one of the}} most ethical problems photographers face. Photojournalists have a moral responsibility to decide what pictures to take, what picture to stage, and what pictures to show the public. For example, photographs of violence and tragedy are prevalent in American journalism because as an understated rule of thumb, that [...] "if it bleeds, it leads". The public is attracted to gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. A lot of controversy arises when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.|$|E
2500|$|Sadoveanu's {{subsequent}} {{collection of}} short stories, Dureri înăbușite, builds on the latter technique and takes his work {{into the realm of}} social realism and naturalism (believed by Călinescu to have been borrowed from either the French writer Émile Zola or from the Romanian Alexandru Vlahuță). For Călinescu, this choice of style brought [...] "damaging effects" [...] on Sadoveanu's writings, and made Dureri înăbușite [...] "perhaps the poorest" [...] of his collections of stories. In Lovinescu's view, Sadoveanu's move toward naturalism did not imply the necessary recourse <b>to</b> <b>objectivity.</b> The pieces focus on dramatic moments of individual existences. In Lupul ("The Wolf"), an animal is chased and trapped by a group of peasants; the eponymous character in Ion Ursu leaves his village to become a proletarian, and succumbs to alcoholism; the indentured laborer in Sluga ("The Servant") is unable to take revenge on his cruel employer at the right moment; in Doi feciori ("Two Sons"), a boyar comes to feel affection for his illegitimate son, whom he has nonetheless reduced to a lowly condition.|$|E
2500|$|In an [...] "Op-Ed" [...] {{published}} on December 4 in The Jerusalem Post, David A. Harris, {{executive director of}} the American Jewish Committee (AJC), says that he finds it [...] "startling that a former president who prides himself on his ongoing contribution to world peace would write a crude polemic that compromises any pretense <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> and fairness": [...] "Carter leaves out what any reasonable observer, even those that share his basic views of the conflict, would consider obvious facts, but does include stunning distortions".; Harris [...] "cite just two of the numerous examples" [...] of what he calls [...] "such mendacity." [...] The first of these, Harris says, is that [...] "Carter discounts well-established claims that Israel accepted and Arafat rejected a generous offer to create a Palestinian state." [...] The second [...] "manifest distortion," [...] according to Harris, is that [...] "Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'"; whereas well-informed observers know that [...] "Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border." [...] In omitting [...] "these well-known developments," [...] Harris argues, Carter is [...] "leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality." ...|$|E

60|$|Human beings cannot, of course, wholly transcend human nature; {{something}} subjective, if {{only the}} interest that determines the direction of our attention, must remain in all our thought. But scientific philosophy comes nearer <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> than any other human pursuit, and gives us, therefore, the closest constant and the most intimate relation with the outer world {{that it is possible}} to achieve. To the primitive mind, everything is either friendly or hostile; but experience has shown that friendliness and hostility are not the conceptions by which the world is to be understood. Scientific philosophy thus represents, though as yet only in a nascent condition, a higher form of thought than any pre-scientific belief or imagination, and, like every approach to self-transcendence, it brings with it a rich reward in increase of scope and breadth and comprehension. Evolutionism, in spite of its appeals to particular scientific facts, fails to be a truly scientific philosophy because of its slavery to time, its ethical preoccupations, and its predominant interest in our mundane concerns and destiny. A truly scientific philosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering less glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more indifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without the tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.|$|E

50|$|The Flight <b>to</b> <b>Objectivity</b> {{represents}} what Bordo {{refers to}} as a “fresh approach” to Descartes’ Meditations. She critiques the stable notion of objectivity and knowledge inherent in Cartesian thought, notions that, in our contemporary society, have become critically distanced, for “the limitations of science and the interested, even ideological nature of all human pursuits now seem unavoidable recognitions”. Bordo sees that, rather than viewing Descartes from a “coherent abstract or ahistorical” perspective, we need to approach Descartes' philosophical arguments within “the context of the cultural pressures {{that gave rise to}} them”. Susan Hekman notes that Bordo’s The Flight <b>to</b> <b>Objectivity,</b> while not overtly dealing with theorizations of the body, does point to the fact that “the origin of our culture’s text for the body, and particularly the female body, is the work of Descartes”. The Cartesian division of the mind and the body, where the body is the “prison that the mind must escape to achieve knowledge”, guides Bordo’s further analyses of culturally influenced bodies and the shaping of the female body in particular.|$|E
50|$|In {{these early}} exchanges {{and in the}} {{parallel}} debate over the proper understanding of Wittgenstein's remarks on rule-following, some of McDowell's characteristic intellectual stances were formed: to borrow a Wittgensteinian expression, the defence of a realism without empiricism, {{an emphasis on the}} human limits of our aspiration <b>to</b> <b>objectivity,</b> the idea that meaning and mind can be directly manifested in the action, particularly linguistic action, of other people, and a distinctive disjunctive theory of perceptual experience.|$|E
50|$|For {{topics in}} this sphere {{rational}} and informed people hold differing views.

That is, within a certain sphere—the sphere of legitimate controversy—journalists seek conscientiously to be balanced and objective.|$|E
