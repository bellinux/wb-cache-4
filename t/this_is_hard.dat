5|$|Like so much else, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E
25|$|The art of Eastern Catholicism {{has always}} been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in {{countries}} near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The Black Madonna of Częstochowa {{may well have been}} of Byzantine origin - it has been repainted and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the Salus Populi Romani and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.|$|E
25|$|In practice, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to achieve}} and largely remains a {{theoretical}} notion. One of the few states that can be considered close to achieving this state of separation of powers would be the United States of America. On the other hand, legal systems that follow the Westminster model adopt a partial separation of powers. This occurs when there are overlaps across the three branches. In Singapore, the legislature and executive overlap because ministers in the Cabinet are appointed from the Members of Parliament (MPs). Thus, {{the same group of}} people are able to exercise both the power to make law and to execute the law.|$|E

25|$|Many {{thousand}} years of dormancy are expected between large explosive eruptions of volcanoes in the Garibaldi Belt. A {{possible explanation for the}} lower rates of volcanism in the Garibaldi chain is that the associated terrain is being compressed in contrast to the more southern portions of the Cascade Arc. In continental rift zones, magma is able to push its way up through the Earth's crust rapidly along faults, providing less chance for differentiation. This is likely the case south of Mount Hood to the California border and east-southeast of the massive Newberry shield volcano adjacent to the Cascade Range in central Oregon because the Brothers Fault Zone lies in this region. This rift zone might explain the massive amounts of basaltic lava {{in this part of the}} central Cascade Arc. A low convergence rate in a compressional setting with massive stationary bodies of magma under the surface could explain the low volume and differentiated magmas throughout the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews proposed there could be a connection between regional glaciation of the North American continent during glacial periods and higher rates of volcanic activity during regional glacial unload of the continent. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to predict due to the infrequent geological record in this region. But there is specific data, including the temporal grouping of eruptions synglacially or just postglacial within the Garibaldi Belt, that suggests this could be probable.|$|E

Embroidery in wool, and silk or gold thread for the rich, was used for decoration. Edward III established an embroidery workshop in the Tower of London, which presumably produced the robes he and his Queen wore in 1351 of red velvet [...] "embroidered with clouds of silver and eagles of pearl and gold, under each alternate cloud an eagle of pearl, and under each of the other clouds a golden eagle, every eagle having in its beak a Garter with the motto hony soyt qui mal y pense embroidered thereon." ...|$|E
2500|$|EBO is {{not just}} an {{emerging}} concept—it was the basis of the Desert Storm air campaign plan. [...] However, over the years since, multiple views have emerged on what it meant and how it could be implemented. [...] Most notably, military scientists at the Air Force Research Lab, the Army Research Lab and DARPA engaged in research to develop automated tools to annotate options and recommend courses of action. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> science and tools are slow to be implemented. [...] For air forces, it supported the ability for a single aircraft to attack multiple targets, unlike tactics of previous wars, which used multiple aircraft to attack single targets, usually to create destruction without thought of later re-use by allied forces or friendly civilians.|$|E

[...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> saying. [...] It may seem cruel that those whose sufferings are real, whose illness has been brought on by enemy action and very likely in the course of patriotic service, should be treated with such apparent callousness. [...] But there can be no doubt that in an overwhelming proportion of cases, these patients succumb to 'shock' because they get something out of it. [...] To give them this reward is not ultimately a benefit to them because it encourages the weaker tendencies in their character. [...] The nation cannot call on its citizens for courage and sacrifice and, at the same time, state by implication that an unconscious cowardice or an unconscious dishonesty will be rewarded.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{expensive}} flutes {{are usually}} constructed of brass, polished and then silver-plated and lacquered to prevent corrosion or silver-plated nickel silver (nickel-bronze bell metal, 63% Cu, 29% Zn, 5.5% Ni, 1.25% Ag, [...]75% Pb, alloyed As, Sb, Fe, Sn). Flutes {{that are more}} expensive are usually made of more precious metals, most commonly solid sterling silver (92.5% silver), and other alloys including French silver (95% silver, 5% copper), [...] "coin silver" [...] (90% silver), or Britannia silver (95.8% silver). It is reported that old Louis Lot French flutes have a particular sound by nature of their specific silver alloy. [...] Gold/silver flutes are even more expensive. They can be either gold {{on the inside and}} silver on the outside, or vice versa. All-gold and all-platinum flutes also exist. Flutes can also be made out of wood, with African blackwood (grenadilla or Dalbergia melanoxylon) being the most common today. Formerly cocuswood was used but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to obtain today. Wooden flutes were far more common before the early 20th century. The silver flute was introduced by Boehm in 1847, but did not become common until later in the 20th century. Wm.S.Haynes, a flute manufacturer in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, told Georges Barrère that in 1905 he made one silver flute to every 100 wooden flutes, but in the 1930s, he made one wooden flute to every 100 silver flutes.|$|E
2500|$|Phoenician ship models {{also provide}} archaeologists {{information}} regarding {{the technical aspects of}} seafaring, and the cultural importance of seafaring for the ancient Phoenicians. However, some models offer tantalizing pieces of information that are, however, difficult to interpret. Item number H-3134 at the Hecht Museum, a dark-brown clay model of a 5th-century BCE oared boat, is one such craft. The vessel has no provenance, save for the reported location of its discovery off the Phoenician coast, but scientists have been able to tentatively confirm the origin and authenticity of this model. [...] The model is of an oared boat manned by three pairs of oarsmen, who are rendered with “hands … raised to their chests, in the last instant of pulling the oar in the water, before lifting it for the recovery.” [...] The mystery of this model is the purpose of small holes- three on the starboard side, and four on port- that were made in the sides of the ship with a sharp tool before the clay dried. [...] It is believed that the holes are too small to pass an oar through, and thus would not be used for rowing purposes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to prove, however, because the poorly preserved state of the model and the amount of fouling that is layered on the model makes it difficult to definitively rule out this possibility. [...] Another theory regarding the purpose of these holes suggests that “ropes for holding oars were threaded through these holes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Snowden's first {{television}} interview aired January 26, 2014, on Germany's NDR. In April 2014, {{he appeared on}} video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, [...] "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country." [...] Benjamin Wittes in The New Republic described the exchange as [...] "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin". Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Snowden said his question was intended [...] "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden {{and the director of}} national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." [...] Snowden called Putin's response [...] "evasive". A few days later, The Daily Beast reported that Snowden himself [...] "instantly regretted" [...] asking Putin the [...] "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. Ben Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisers, told the Beast that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. [...] "I know <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to believe," [...] Wizner acknowledged. [...] "I know if I was just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it." [...] Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, [...] "Yeah, that was terrible! Oh, Jesus, that blew up in my face. ... And in the United States, what I did appearing at that Putin press conference was not worth the price." ...|$|E
