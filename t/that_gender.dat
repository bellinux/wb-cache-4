5|$|A central {{principle}} of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim. Diane Elson, Caren Grown and Nilufer Cagatay explore the role <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> inequalities play {{in international trade}} and how such trade reshapes gender inequality itself. They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.|$|E
5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E
40|$|Few would {{dispute that}} {{dependent}} children suffer hardship when a parent, particularly a sole parent or substitute, is imprisoned. This paper focuses on how some Western Australian criminal law courts {{have dealt with}} hardship suffered by offenders‟ dependent children. It explores how the judiciary in assessing hardship has applied mercy, the exceptional circumstances test, and a recent legislative provision when considering sentencing a mothering person to a prison term. If found, extreme hardship may mitigate the severity of a prison sentence. This paper argues <b>that</b> <b>gendering</b> processes are at work in criminal law, such as <b>gendering</b> <b>that</b> respects the mothering person-child relationship. The paper concludes by suggesting <b>that</b> <b>gendering</b> processes preserving <b>that</b> relationship has implications for promoting deterrence rather than a term of imprisonment...|$|R
40|$|Because men {{and women}} differ with regard to {{independent}} and interdependent self-construals, we propose that downward comparisons {{are more likely to}} lower women's achievement-related self-evaluations compared to men's. We also hypothesize <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> self-schemas provide men with advantages in the processing of self-related dispositional information and women with advantages in the processing of self-related social-contextual information. To the extent that a downward social comparison presents a potential threat to the self, {{men and women}} differ in how effectively they can fend off the implications of different types of comparisons. Results from three experiments (total N = 393) support these hypotheses, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> responses to downward comparison are at least in part driven by a culturally normative focus on dispositional information prevalent in the West...|$|R

5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which the poem is thought to have been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.|$|E

40|$|A {{livelihoods}} approach positions individuals, situated within households, {{as active}} agents within processes occurring at various scales. Environmental conservation efforts represent one such process with direct implications for local sustainable livelihoods and the gendered nature of livelihood strategies. In this article, I examine collective processes of socio-environmental identity construction as gendered sustainable livelihood strategies, articulated {{in and through}} the activities of women 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural organizations in communities bordering the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in rural southern Mexico. I present group histories and visual evidence from group activities – adapted from participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methodology – to highlight two important concepts. These are: (1) <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> livelihood strategies are outcomes of negotiations within households and communities, in response to specific gendered opportunities and constraints; and (2) <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> livelihood strategies consist of linked material and ideological aspects...|$|R
5|$|The role <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> {{plays in}} health care access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless {{they are in a}} very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{present a}} {{preliminary}} study that examines the sexual comments and insults users directed at three conversational agents that differed in the gender impressions of their embodiment.

Results indicate <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> presentation has little effect on insult frequency, but sexual comments greatly increase with female embodiment. Further analysis suggests <b>that</b> people perform <b>gender</b> with embodied agents, and do so more with female embodiment, at least within sexual contexts, than they do with male embodiment...|$|R
30|$|A {{few studies}} that analyze data {{a few years}} before the {{communist}} regimes’ fall reported <b>that</b> the <b>gender</b> wage gap existed and was explained by occupational attainment (e.g., Brainerd 2000, Giddings 2002 and Orazem and Vodopivec 2000). Atkinson and Micklewright (1992) reported <b>that</b> the <b>gender</b> wage gap was substantial under communism given the low wage dispersion. Ham et al. (1995) reported <b>that</b> the <b>gender</b> wage gap is generally attributed to discriminatory promotion practices and to the segregation of women into low-paying occupations. To our knowledge, no study has analyzed the occupational wage gap either in general or separately for men and women before and {{after the fall of the}} communist regime.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} as well as being {{sensitive}} to wider discourses of gender relations, social workers need to consider the ways in which gender is localised. It is argued that to some extent gender practices vary according to local culture, <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> identities are often localised and that social workers tend to construct their clients according to images of local men and women. These images tend to be stereotypical but some do also reflect dominant local gendered practices. The paper draws on data from qualitative interviews with social workers and probation officers, as well as the experience of teaching social work students, to illustrate these arguments. Whilst it is argued that the localising of gender is of general relevance, the data come from Wales alone. The author's conclusion is that (amongst other things) anti‐oppressive practice involves recognising the important influence of local stereotypes and challenging them, whilst also acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> practices do vary from place to place...|$|R

25|$|Many {{activists and}} {{scholars}} embrace the reforms as evidence <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> equality {{is compatible with}} Islamic principles; indeed, some scholars have argued that what {{they consider to be}} an authentic interpretation of Shari'a actually requires reforms in the name of gender equality.|$|E
25|$|Anna Livia and Kira Hall {{have noted}} that while {{research}} in the 1960s and 1970s on the difference between men's and women's speech made the implicit assumption <b>that</b> <b>gender</b> was the relevant way to divide the social space, there is still considerable room for linguistic research based on sexual orientation, rather than gender.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{important}} to point out <b>that</b> <b>gendered</b> differences in regard to social construction are also said to be driven by relations of power, typically through patriarchal ideologies which privilege men over women. These power relations influence differences between the genders, which additionally influences variables of sexuality, such as sexual attitudes and behaviours. Similar to social role theory, these constructions are often influenced by physical traits.|$|R
