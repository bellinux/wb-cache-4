25|$|Many {{species of}} flies of the two-winged type, Order Diptera, such as mosquitoes, horse-flies, blow-flies and warble-flies cause direct {{parasitic}} disease to domestic animals, and transmit organisms that cause diseases. These infestations and infections cause distress to companion animals, and in livestock industry the financial costs of these diseases are high. These problems occur wherever domestic animals are reared. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>provides</b> {{an overview of}} parasitic flies from a veterinary perspective, with emphasis on the disease causing relationships between these flies and their host animals. The article is organized following the taxonomic hierarchy of these flies in the Phylum Arthropoda, Order Insecta. Families and genera of dipteran flies are emphasized rather than many individual species. Disease caused by the feeding activity of the flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; prominent examples are provided from the many species.|$|E

2500|$|Article 8 {{provides}} {{a right to}} respect for one's [...] "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions that are [...] "in accordance with law" [...] and [...] "necessary in a democratic society". This article clearly {{provides a}} right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for [...] "private and family life" [...] that <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>provides</b> a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still deems such familial sexual acts to be criminal. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus not to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to do something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).|$|E
