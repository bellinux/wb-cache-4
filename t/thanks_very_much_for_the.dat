It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision."

It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|R

40|$|On April 22 2015, Murray Marshall {{was invited}} by Igor Klep and Victor Vinnikov {{to talk in}} the special session on "Operator Theory, Real Algebraic Geometry, and Moment Problems" that they co-organised for IWOTA 2015 in Tbilisi, Georgia, July 6 [...] 10. This {{invitation}} to an IWOTA edition was considered by the organisers as long overdue, given Marshall's important contributions to Real Algebraic Geometry in general, and to the multi-dimensional Moment Problem in particular. Marshall declined on April 27 th writing: "Dear Victor, <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> invitation. I am sorry but I must decline. The reason is that I don't enjoy traveling as much as I used to. North America or Europe is about the maximum distance I am willing to dealwith. I hope you are well. Murray. " This response startled us, as Marshall {{has always been a}} grand traveler when it came to mathematics. Our fears were alas confirmed; Marshall passed away just a few days later.

You have received many letters from other Bryant graduates saying that they had found no other schools with a service club like yours. I will echo their statements. I have met many fellows who have attended many different business schools and collegs [sic], and none of them have attended schools that have service clubs like Bryant’s. 4. 		A word of advice to those of you studying typing. Learn how to use carbon. If you ever have to do any work for the Army, Navy, or any governmental agency you will use carbon, carbon, and more carbon.
