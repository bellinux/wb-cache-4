5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} {{is related to}} Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry.

Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
