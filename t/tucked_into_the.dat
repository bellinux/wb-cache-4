5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> obi (the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The fan may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} 25th Anniversary commemoration, the Transformers Universe series {{released}} a new mold of Dinobot. Like the Beast Wars figure, the Universe figure lacked show-accurate coloration. The transformation is also slightly different, with <b>the</b> arms <b>tucking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chest rather than the legs.|$|R
50|$|Tom, {{with his}} foot wrapped in bandages, is given a nice pie from Mammy. Tom takes most of the pie, but leaves the {{remainder}} of it for Jerry who, using the magnet, brings the dish of pie to his mousehole and happily <b>tucks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pie.|$|R

25|$|Nivi – styles {{originally}} worn in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka; {{besides the}} modern nivi, {{there is also}} the kaccha nivi, where the pleats are passed through the legs and <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waist at the back. This allows free movement while covering the legs.|$|E
2500|$|Women, {{particularly}} in France, began wearing a boutonnière, {{or a small}} bouquet of fresh flowers in a [...] "bosom bottle." [...] About four inches in length, these glass or tin bottles were small enough to discreetly <b>tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bosom or hair, but also just large enough to contain water to keep the flowers from wilting.|$|R
50|$|Howard Pyle {{uses this}} tale {{in his book}} The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, but changes several details. He gives Alan's {{sweetheart}} the name Ellen, and introduces Friar <b>Tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> story; <b>Tuck</b> is sought out specifically as the only priest who will perform the wedding {{in defiance of the}} bishop, and therefore, this tale is combined with that of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar.|$|R
5000|$|Much later, Bugs {{has finally}} made it to Pismo Beach and, while <b>tucking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area's famous clams, casually wonders how Daffy's {{encounter}} with the genie worked out. Opening one clam and discovering a pearl inside, he soon finds out; Daffy, shrunk to a few inches in height, emerges from Bugs' burrow trail {{in the sand and}} claims the pearl for his own. Bugs closes the clam on the greedy duck by saying [...] "Oh, brother. Close sesame!" ...|$|R
25|$|The hem is <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trousers. For informal- or formalwear, a {{coat and}} tie (or bow tie) are compulsory. When a tie is worn, the top button of the shirt is fastened, so the tie can fit snugly around the wearer’s neck with a neat appearance.|$|E
25|$|Running {{with the}} hands pumping, <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side. This tucked in run up is {{intended}} to set the pattern for the whole delivery, keeping everything in a tight corridor flowing towards the target. Some bowlers choose to sacrifice this to cover the ball with the non-bowling hand to disguise the grip.|$|E
25|$|The {{triangular}} folding is {{continued until}} {{the entire length}} of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> previous fold.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{uncommon}} sharp practice," [...] said Peterkin {{with a broad}} grin. [...] "Don't {{you think}} we should awake her to make her eat something first? Or perhaps," [...] he added with a grave, meditative look--"perhaps we might put some food in her mouth, which is so elegantly open at the present moment, and see if she'd swallow it while asleep.--If so, Ralph, you might come round to the front here and feed her quietly, while Jack and I are <b>tucking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> victuals. It would be a monstrous economy of time." ...|$|R

25|$|Miami Marlins – An {{estimated}} 57,000 fans watched 50-year-old Satchel Paige pitch {{there for}} the Marlins on Aug. 7, 1956. On that occasion, the diamond was <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> southeast corner of the stadium, with a high temporary fence {{in front of the}} right field seating area. The minor league Marlins played occasional other games there between 1956–60.|$|E
25|$|The pneumofathometer line on {{a surface}} {{supplied}} umbilical {{is a valuable}} backup supply in case of damage to the main supply hose, or if a diver needs to supply air to another diver on surface supply, as the usual configurations of helmet and full face mask do not allow buddy breathing of the conventional kind. The Pneumo line can be <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> neck dam or under the skirt of a full face mask, and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the bra took off the way it did {{in large part because of}} World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in {{factories}} and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{wishing to}} be separated, Littlefoot leads his friends {{away from the}} adults during the night, {{intending}} to find food before they are found missing. They leave a trail for the grownups to follow, and eventually reach the [...] "Big Water". Although they are disgusted by the saltwater, they see a verdant island connected to the mainland by a thin land bridge. On their way, an earthshake occurs, causing it a tsunami that they narrowly escape. They quickly <b>tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plentiful bounty of the island, but are then horrified to discover the tsunami has destroyed the land bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{ready for}} work then," [...] said Mr Merryboy, through a rather large mouthful. [...] "No time to lose. Eat--eat well--for there's lots to do.

50|$|The Advanced Jumbo {{replaced}} the original Gibson Jumbo. It had rosewood back and sides, an Adirondack Spruce soundboard, a 25.5 inch scale length, and a 1.725 inch nut width.The Advanced Jumbo and the Jumbo 35 were both introduced in 1936. Both of these instruments were 16 in wide, and had 14 frets clear of their bodies. The Jumbo 35 was the lower-priced model, going for just $35.The Advanced Jumbo was retailed at $80, still {{less than the}} $100 Martin D-28 Dreadnought.It was also built a bit more inexpensively than the Martin instrument.For example, the main braces did not <b>tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side bandings, which could cause problems.|$|R
25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{waistband}} of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} a fast bowler {{needs to do}} is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close {{together}} {{at the top of the}} seam with the thumb gripping the ball at the bottom of the seam. The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls – see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand gripping the ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.|$|E
25|$|The south field {{consists}} of the two longer runways, 07/25 and 14/32, designed for jet airliners. The public passenger terminal is <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of the}} intersection of the two runways, while the two general aviation FBOs for the south field are nearer to the threshold of runway 25. Customs services for private aircraft are available at the two fixed-base operators (FBO), Shell Aerocentre and Esso, on the south field. There are also a number of aviation component repair facilities on airport grounds, mostly in the Esso Avitat complex. The Government of Canada operates a number of hangars, including the Canada Reception Centre, which is used to greet visiting dignitaries. The National Research Council operates two facilities {{on the north side of}} the grounds, including a wind tunnel. Transport Canada operates two facilities on airport grounds, one which houses training equipment, including flight simulators, and a hangar for maintenance and storage of government owned aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Finding {{room for}} the KY-28 in fighter {{aircraft}} was difficult. The Navy improvised successfully, for example <b>tucking</b> KY-28s <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nose wheel well of F-4 Phantoms, while the Air Force initiated a formal modification program that took years to complete.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn was too head-achy to be customarily timid. [...] "Let's see that. Did I {{give you}} only five dollars?" [...] Receiving the bill, he folded it with much primness, <b>tucked</b> it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{pocket of his}} shirt, and remarked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For we are {{differently}} gifted," [...] continued Mr. Gloag, now addressing his congregation. [...] "To some {{is given}} courage, to some learning, to some grace.

25|$|Bailout supply {{pressure}} options: If the interstage pressure for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the main {{supply pressure}}, the main supply will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main supply pressure, the bailout gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|E
25|$|For The Invasion, Privates and Corporals wore , while {{ranks of}} Sergeant and above wore uniforms based on , but lacking buttons {{and with the}} jacket — {{which appears to be}} {{fastened}} by velcro — <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trousers. All UNIT members wore oval patches with 'U.N.I.T' embroidered on them on their left sleeves and NCOs wore their badges of rank on their right sleeves. Sand/Beige coloured berets, similar to those worn by the Special Air Service with the black UNIT logo on a round white background as a cap badge were worn by all ranks. There was also the assault team, who wore 1960 pattern fatigues and dark berets with the same UNIT insignia. For UNIT's next appearance, Spearhead from Space (1970), the No.4s became uniform for all ranks, except for two radar operators seen in the opening who wear No.7s; the female officer wearing a tie with a UNIT logo printed on. The No.4 style of uniform stayed throughout Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970).|$|E
500|$|Within the Dvorak {{satellite}} strength {{estimate for}} tropical cyclones, {{there are several}} visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define {{the upper and lower}} bounds on its intensity. [...] The central dense overcast (CDO) pattern is one of those patterns. [...] The central dense overcast utilizes the size of the CDO. [...] The CDO pattern intensities start at T2.5, equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity, [...] [...] The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered. [...] The farther the center is <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> CDO, the stronger it is deemed. [...] Banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center, using a ten degree logarithmic spiral. [...] Using the 85–92 GHz channels of polar-orbiting microwave satellite imagery can definitively locate the center within the CDO.|$|E
