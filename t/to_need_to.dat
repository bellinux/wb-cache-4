Excursions may be upward or downward from the storage depth, and the allowed depth change may be the same in both directions, or sometimes slightly less upward than downward. Excursion limits are generally based on a 6 to 8 hour time limit, as this is the standard time limit for a diving shift.|$|E

[...] Due to time constraints however (the Tornado is expected <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be replaced around 2030), Germany is instead looking into acquiring an already commercially available system, probably the Lockheed Martin F-35. The FCAS however isn't cancelled but now planned as successor to the Eurofighter Typhoon.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Winter, {{author of}} Fear Itself: The Horror Fiction of Stephen King, {{believes}} that Flagg epitomizes the Gothic villain—an [...] "atavistic embodiment of evil"—since his appearance is indistinct, malleable and a “collection of masks". Flagg symbolizes [...] "the inexplicable {{fear of the}} return of bygone powers—both technological and, as his last name intimates, sociopolitical". Like other Gothic villains, Flagg’s plans seem to fail at every turn as he seems <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> convince others of his importance. Winter asserts that Flagg is a Miltonic superman who receives his strength from a dark, mysterious source. He compares him to J. R. R. Tolkien’s Sauron in The Lord of the Rings: both collapse when directly confronted.|$|E

[...] Djemal then secretly ordered all Ottoman naval officers to strictly follow Souchon's directives.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October.

I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work out a bit. And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost.

Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that [...] "Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers", and considered that Moonraker [...] "is as mercilessly readable as all the rest". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that [...] "Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock."
