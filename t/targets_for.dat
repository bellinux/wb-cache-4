50|$|A given {{constituency}} may be <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> one purpose, {{but not for}} another. In the USA, {{inner city}} neighborhoods, with heavy Democratic populations, may not be <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> legislative seats because the districts are safely Democratic, but will be <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> Presidential elections to offset strong Republican areas elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, {{in order}} to meet an urgent need to {{increase}} the number of aircraft able to designate <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used to designate <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, Keating {{was named}} by the National Republican Congressional Committee as one of 36 top Democratic <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> the 2018 {{election}}s. The hope of Republicans is to gain seats in the mid-term election by challenging in blue-collar parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|RNA interference-based {{applications}} {{are being developed}} to target persistent HIV-1 infection. Viruses like HIV-1 are particularly difficult <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> RNAi-attack because they are escape-prone, which requires combinatorial RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape.|$|E

5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} {{combat operations}} {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign during the Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> critics of the synthesis.|$|E

5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, is {{an unusual}} multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
50|$|During the {{occupation}} of Japan, 16 zaibatsu were <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> complete dissolution, and 26 more for reorganization after dissolution. Among the zaibatsu <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> dissolution in 1947 were Asano, Furukawa, Nakajima, Nissan, Nomura, and Okura. Their controlling families' assets were seized, holding companies eliminated, and interlocking directorships, essential to the old system of intercompany coordination, were outlawed. Matsushita (which later took the name Panasonic), while not a zaibatsu, was originally also <b>targeted</b> <b>for</b> dissolution, but was saved by a petition signed by 15,000 of its unionized workers and their families.|$|R

5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} {{explored}} {{on several occasions}} by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was {{designed}} to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship, theoretically offering the ability to scout ahead {{of the group and}} locate <b>targets</b> <b>for</b> the smaller ships to attack. They were enlarged and more powerfully armed versions of the earlier ships, fitted with steam turbines. Curiously, they were no faster than the older ships and equally unsuccessful in their intended role as they lacked the speed of the destroyers they were supposed to escort.|$|E
