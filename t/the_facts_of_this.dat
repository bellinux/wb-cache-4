25|$|Before the {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been completely}} abandoned, {{one of the most}} violent conflicts between British forces and Australian Aborigines is alleged to have occurred. <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> event are still disputed by historians and the descendants of the Tasmanian Aborigines, however, it is alleged that on the morning of 3 May 1804, a food hunting party of approximately three hundred crested the heavily wooded hills above the Risdon Cove settlement, looking for kangaroo, in what is now considered {{to be part of the}} Oyster Bay tribe's traditional hunting grounds. It is supposed that both the Marine sentries, and the hunting party surprised each other. It is not clear how the engagement began, with differing accounts being given. It does seem that, feeling threatened by such an overwhelmingly large group, the Marines fired upon the Aborigines in an unprovoked attack. A convict by the name of Edward White claimed to have seen this. Armed with only spears and clubs, the Aboriginals were outdone by the firepower of the Marines who were armed with the Brown Bess smooth bore, muzzle loading musket, many of whom were experienced troops from conflicts in India and the Americas. It is claimed that between three and fifty of the Aboriginals were killed.|$|E

[...] The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes, who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to [...] "the nasty details, the blemishes, <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> world that truly corrupt our collective sense of well-being and hope" [...] in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed.|$|E

500|$|In his {{majority}} opinion, Justice Samuel Alito {{held that}} the exclusion of Ayala's counsel during the Batson hearings was harmless error. Justice Alito emphasized that under federal law, prisoners are not entitled to habeas relief unless they can demonstrate [...] "actual prejudice". Additionally, Justice Alito noted that under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, federal courts should be [...] "highly deferential" [...] to state courts [...] "when a prisoner's 'claim' has been 'adjudicated on the merits' in state court". Applying these standards to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case, Justice Alito ruled that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice and that the California Supreme Court's opinion [...] "represented an entirely reasonable application of controlling precedent". Consequently, Justice Alito {{held that the}} Ninth Circuit's ruling should be reversed and that the case should be remanded for reconsideration {{in light of the}} Supreme Court's decision.|$|E

Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983). <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case, which involved two separate appellants, {{were similar to those}} of Zamir. Khera had entered the country by allegedly deceiving a medical officer into thinking he was not married. An answer to the contrary would have precluded him from being given leave to enter the UK. The other appellant, Khawaja, having unsuccessfully applied for a UK visa in Brussels, entered the UK by flying into Manchester, saying he would stay for one week and then return to Brussels to continue his studies. Facts later surfaced proving that, {{at the time of his}} entry, contrary to his declaration that he was single, he had been married to a woman who had entered the UK on the same flight but had been attended to by a different immigration officer and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a returning resident. Both of them were detained as [...] "illegal immigrants".|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{the stage}} of {{capacity}} of a dream guide to put in such an appearance so as to inform the unwitting dreamer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>this</b> is a dream; must be preceded by the stage (achieved in some previous nights) of the witting dreamer informing (in a manner acceptable, or course, to themselves) prospective dream guides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> being a dream, and securing their agreement to this fact. This stage will in turn have quite likely have been preceded by a still earlier stage in which the witting dreamer will have endeavored to secure the agreement, by prospective dream guides, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> being a dream, but having been rebuffed by them (the rebuff have been due merely to the statement's not having been made in a style suitable to their literary fashion, which can be quite punctilious).|$|R

Yet Ludlow was earnest in his description of the horrors of withdrawal, adding that “f, from a human distaste of dwelling too long upon the horrible, I have been led to speak so lightly of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> part of my experience that any man may think the returning way of ascent an easy one, and dare the downward road of ingress, I would repair the fault with whatever of painfully-elaborated prophecy of wretchedness may be in my power, for through all this time I was indeed a greater sufferer than any bodily pain could possibly make me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{court found}} that the statute {{does not apply to}} <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case, since plaintiffs cited no {{authority}} to support their contention that section 631 covers the retrieval, printing and reading of E-mail messages which is not authorized by the author of the message. This decision is {{based on the fact that}} (1) There is no allegation that Nissan [...] "tapped" [...] into its own telephone lines, and indeed there would be no need to do so since, being the system operator, Nissan had access to the network without resort to a telephone line tap. (2) Likewise, as the owner and operator of the system, Nissan's connection to the telephone lines or cable which connected the system would necessarily be authorized. And (3) Nissan did not access the messages during transmission. Rather, the messages were retrieved from an electronic storage device and printed so that they could be read. Thus the Court found that Nissan's actions in retrieving, printing and reading plaintiffs' E-mail messages simply were not included within the actions proscribed by California Penal Code section 631.|$|E

2500|$|To {{justify the}} use of deadly force, it is not enough, however, for the police officer to merely express a {{subjective}} fear of death or great bodily harm. Unreasonable fear cannot justify {{the use of}} deadly force. The use of deadly force must be objectively reasonable and necessary, given {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case, it is my conclusion that the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez was not justified, and that sufficient facts exist to prove that to be true. Accordingly, we filed a criminal complaint this morning in Ramsey County.In his press conference announcing his decision to prosecute Yanez, Choi noted facts not consistent with a justified fear of Castile, namely that Yanez's partner, Officer Kauser, who was standing at the car's passenger window during the shooting, [...] "did not touch or remove his gun from its holster",and that in his answers to questioning by Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde immediately after the shooting, Yanez [...] "stated he did not know where [...] gun was".

2500|$|Fifth, Stevens {{criticized the}} majority's {{fear that the}} {{government}} could use BCRA §203 to censor the media. The focus placed on this hypothetical fear {{made no sense to}} him because it did not relate to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case – if the government actually attempted to apply BCRA §203 to the media (and assuming that Citizens United could not constitute [...] "media"), the Court could deal with the problem at that time. Stevens described the majority's supposed protection of the media as nothing more than posturing. According to him, it was the majority's new rule, announced in this case, that prohibited a law from distinguishing between [...] "speakers" [...] or funding sources. This new rule would be the only reason why media corporations could not be exempted from BCRA §203. In this, Stevens and the majority conceptualize the First Amendment's protection of [...] "the press" [...] quite differently. Stevens argues that the [...] "Press" [...] is an entity, which can be distinguished from other persons and entities which are not [...] "press". The majority opinion viewed [...] "freedom of the press" [...] as an activity, applicable to all citizens or groups of citizens seeking to publish views.|$|E
