50|$|When eBay {{changed its}} {{policies}} to prohibit the auction of firearms and firearm parts (such as barrels, magazines and <b>trigger</b> <b>assemblies,</b> essentially any part {{involved in the}} firing of a gun), thousands of gun and part auctions migrated to GunBroker.com. In 2008, Hitwise, a Web site measurement service, ranked GunBroker.com third in the United States' “Shopping and Classifieds—Auctions” category, exceeded only by eBay and eBay Motors.|$|R
50|$|The {{two-stage}} {{trigger mechanism}} has an adjustable trigger pull weight of 10 to 20 N (2.2 to 4.4 lbf). The <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> {{can be easily}} removed for cleaning by undoing two socket-head cap screws.|$|E
50|$|The T86 is modular {{and can be}} field-stripped {{without using}} special tools. The gas piston system and the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> can be removed as {{complete}} assemblies for maintenance, {{reducing the risk of}} losing small parts.|$|E
50|$|The KAC PDW {{combines}} new and off {{the shelf}} components in its design. The lower receiver, holding the magazine and <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly,</b> is essentially a shortened M16 rifle lower receiver,which makes the basic operating controls familiar to many potential users.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 {{production}} of the classic models was largely ceased {{in favor of a}} new series of pistols taking most of their features from the Charles Petter SACM style of pistols (also seen in the SIG P210 and CZ-75. Namely, these all had inverted slide rails and closed cam path locking. Many also had modular (removable) <b>trigger</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Most were double-action, though some retained the classic style single-action lockwork.|$|R

5000|$|Action: The M40 {{has always}} been based on the Remington 700 Short Action with [...]308 bolt face, and this is no {{different}} in the M40A3. These actions are tuned by Marine armorers; the <b>trigger</b> guard <b>assembly</b> is manufactured by the DD Ross Company, though several M40A3s use Badger Ordnance trigger guards. In 2007, the Marine Corps began replacing the DD Ross <b>trigger</b> guard <b>assemblies</b> with the M5 detachable magazine trigger guard manufactured by Badger Ordnance.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1960s, Crouch {{sold his}} design to the High Standard Manufacturing Company, who used their Flite King shotgun {{as the basis}} for the first model, the 10A. The Flite King was {{modified}} by replacing the stock, relocating the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly,</b> and fitting a three-piece plastic shell around the receiver and first half of the barrel. The rearward piece of the shell provided an attachment point for the rotatable shoulder stock. The lower piece of the shell provided the grip. Since the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> was moved forward to accommodate the bullpup design, a rod that connected the new and original trigger locations was used to allow minimal modifications to the original Flite King receiver.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Allround" [...] {{most closely}} resembles the P226 the range is built on. It is an X-Five with a DA/SA <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{and has the}} normal SIG Sauer decocker and {{internal}} safeties. The pistol is, amongst other things, intended for the IPSC Production division.|$|E
50|$|If {{performed}} improperly, bedding {{can destroy}} a rifle. Mechanical locking occurs when bedding material {{is allowed to}} harden in holes or around protrusions on the action. If locking occurs, the action can be permanently fixed to the stock. Extreme measures {{may have to be}} taken to separate the stock from the action, possibly destroying one or both. Locking can be prevented by carefully filling all holes and crevices in the action with clay and removing or taping any protrusions on the action. Never apply bedding material on the upper half of the action or anything that is wider at the bottom than the top. Improperly applied or insufficient release agent can cause the bedding material to bind to the metal. If the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> is not removed prior to bedding, epoxy can seep into the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> and ruin it.|$|E
40|$|The nucleocapsid (NC) {{domains of}} {{retrovirus}} precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins play {{an essential role}} in virus assembly. Evidence suggests that NC binding to viral RNA promotes dimerization of PrGag capsid (CA) domains, which <b>triggers</b> <b>assembly</b> of CA N-terminal domains (NTDs) into hexamer rings that are intercon-nected by CA C-terminal domains. To examine the influence of dimerization on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Gag protein assembly in vitro, we analyzed the assembly properties of Gag proteins in which NC domains were replaced with cysteine residues that could be linked via chemical treatment. In accordance with the model that Gag protein pairing <b>triggers</b> <b>assembly,</b> we found that cysteine cross-linking or oxidation reagents induced the assembly of virus-like particles. However, efficient assembly also was observed to be temperature dependent or required the tethering of NTDs. Our results suggest a multistep pathway for HIV- 1 Gag protein assembly. In the first step, Gag protein pairing through NC-RNA interactions or C-terminal cysteine linkage fosters dimerization. Next, a conformational change converts assembly-restricted dimers or small oligomers into assembly-competent ones. At the final stage, final particle assembly occurs, possibly through a set of larger intermediates. When expressed in cells, the precursor Gag (PrGag) pro-teins of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency viru...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Extracellular Ca 2 ÷ <b>triggers</b> <b>assembly</b> and sealing {{of tight}} {{junctions}} (TJs) in MDCK cells. These events are modulated by G-proteins, phospholipase C, protein kinase C (PKC), and calmodulin. In the present work we observed that 1, 2 -dioctanoylglycerol (diC 8) promotes {{the assembly of}} TJ in low extracellular Ca 2 ÷, as evidenced by translocation of the TJassociated protein ZO- 1 to the plasma membrane, formation of junctional fibrils observed in freeze-fracture replicas, decreased permeability of the intercellular space to [3 H]mannitol, and reorganization of actin illaments to the cell periphery, visualized by fluorescence microscopy using rhodamine-phalloidin. In contrast, diC 8 in low Ca 2 ÷ did not induce redistribution of the Ca-dependent adhesion protein E-cadherin (uvomoru...|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{assembly}} also contains the spring extractor, while a lever case ejector {{is located at}} the base of the feed tray. Spent casings are ejected downward. The weapon has a striker firing mechanism, a <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> for fully automatic only fire and a cross-bolt safety (the [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the bolt catch).|$|E
50|$|The <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly,</b> mounted {{inside the}} receiver, is {{operated}} by the mainspring and suitable for automatic fire. It has no single shot mode. The manual rotating type safety locks the sear, which engages the sear notch of the bolt carrier assembly, and the trigger lug does not allow the bolt earner assembly {{to go all the}} way back.|$|E
5000|$|Triangular shaped markings, {{some with}} an arrow inside, on many {{components}} of the rifle. Normally three [...] "R"'s surrounded by crossed stalks with leaves pointing outwards are {{on the top of}} the breech. Year stamps are quite visible. The <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> is unique in the Romanian 91/30 and is adjustable. It is not interchangeable with other Mosins.|$|E
5000|$|The Weatherby Varmintmaster is {{a lighter}} quicker-handling {{version of the}} Weatherby Mark V. It was first offered for sale in 1963 in two barrel lengths: a 24-inch {{standard}} weight and 26-inch heavy weight. The price then was $295, same as the Mark V. Compared with the Mark V it weighs 40% less with most parts being reduced in size by 20%. The <b>trigger</b> <b>assemblies</b> are identical. Having a smaller bolt diameter, the Varmintmaster uses a six-lug locking bolt as opposed to nine for the original magnum-sized Mark V. Chambered in [...]224 Weatherby Magnum with a 55-grain bullet, it achieves a muzzle velocity of 3,750 ft/s. Weatherby ceased production of its smallest rifle in 1994.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{nonlinear}} hybridization chain reaction (HCR) {{system in which}} a trigger DNA initiates self-sustained assembly of quenched double-stranded substrates into fluorescent dendritic nanostructures. During the process, {{an increasing number of}} originally sequestered trigger sequences labeled with fluorescent reporters are freed up from quenched substrates, leading to chain-branching growth of the assembled DNA dendrimers and an exponential increase in the fluorescence intensity. The <b>triggered</b> <b>assembly</b> behavior was examined by PAGE analysis, and the morphologies of the grown dendrimers were verified by AFM imaging. The exponential kinetics of the fluorescence accumulation was also confirmed by time-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy. This method adopts a simple sequence design strategy, the concept of which could be adapted to program assembly systems with higher-order growth kinetics...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWe {{describe}} a {{technology for the}} profiling of miRNA expression in intact cells. The technology is based on sensor oligonucleotides that are cleavable, completely complementary to a target miRNA, and dual-labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher. Upon entering the cell, the sensor oligonucleotide binds its specific miRNA target through complementary base-pairing. This <b>triggers</b> <b>assembly</b> of the endogenous RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) around the miRNA-sensor duplex and cleavage of the sensor oligonucleotide, resulting in separation between the dye and quencher, and a fluorescence turn-on. In the presented feasibility studies, we focus on a specific miRNA (miR- 10 b) implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Using a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, we illustrate the application of this technology for miRNA detection with nanomolar sensitivity in both a cell-free system and intact cells...|$|R
50|$|A {{sustained}} {{downward force}} of approximately ten kilograms on the pressure plate {{for a minimum}} of 0.10 seconds compresses the firing spring and cocks the striker. Continuous downward movement allows the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> to pivot, slowly forcing the air out of an anti-shock bladder and flips the striker down into the stab sensitive M41 detonator, at which point the mine explodes.|$|E
50|$|The weapon {{uses the}} same {{ammunition}} as the AK-47: the 7.62×39mm M43 intermediate rifle cartridge. The AKM mechanism's design principles and procedures for loading and firing are practically identical {{to those of the}} AK-47, the only difference being the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> (during the return stage of the bolt carrier on fully automatic mode) as a result of incorporating the rate reducer device.|$|E
50|$|A {{semi-automatic}} {{version of}} the rifle known as the AUG P is available to the civilian and law enforcement markets. It features a shorter, 407 mm barrel and a modified bolt, carrier and <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> that will only allow semi-automatic fire. The rifle also has a slightly different optical sight that features a reticule with a fine dot {{in the center of}} the aiming circle, allowing for more precise aiming.|$|E
50|$|It {{is issued}} in an {{aluminium}} transport case with {{equipment and accessories}} for {{a wide array of}} tactical situations.(IMAGE) Included in the case are two different grip and <b>trigger</b> <b>assemblies,</b> one for use with the modified GP-25/30 grenade launcher and another for use when the launcher is detached. When the grenade launcher is installed, the combined rifle and grenade launcher is operated with a single trigger. A selector switch on left side of the grip near the trigger guard allows the user to select between rifle or grenade barrels. When the grenade launcher is detached, it is replaced by a vertical grip. A suppressor is also included in the standard kit, as is a quick-change short barrel for use with the suppressor or for when maximum compactness is desired.|$|R
50|$|The M67 {{is shaped}} like a long tube with the sight <b>assembly</b> and <b>trigger</b> offset to the side in {{opposite}} directions about halfway along the barrel. Under this point is the monopod, with the bipod halfway back from there. The weapon required a crew of three to operate it; a gunner, assistant gunner (loader) and ammo bearer. The breech is hinged on the right side, {{and had to be}} swung open to load the round. It was then swung closed and when the rifle was fired, the rear end of the shell case broke up and was blown {{out of the back of}} the breech block. On the left side of the barrel, near the sight and <b>trigger</b> <b>assemblies,</b> was an asbestos heat shield to protect the gunner's shoulder and neck from the heat of the barrel when firing.|$|R

50|$|The vehicle-mounted {{variant of}} the MAG lacks a stock, bipod, carry handle, pistol grip, {{ejection}} port dust cover and a mount for optical sights. It does, however, have a new closed-type gas regulator. Depending on the weapon's employment, the machine gun can also be fitted with an extended charging handle linkage, standard trigger group (with a pistol grip), or a specialized <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> with an electrically fired trigger.|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> {{equipped}} with a manual fire control selector (the fire selector lever {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (selector switch in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire selector lever also operates the external safety mechanism (lever in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington SR-8 was a {{prototype}} sniper rifle developed by Remington Arms. It was originally {{developed for the}} Italian Army, and was designed to shoot the [...]338 Lapua cartridge. The design of the rifle {{is based on the}} Remington Model 700, with the <b>trigger</b> <b>assembly</b> and design taken largely from the M24. The ejector design had to be modified from that of the standard Model 700 to allow for the larger rim of the [...]338 Lapua cartridge.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of catalysis and self-assembly influences many key processes in living systems. Synthetic analogues of such systems may provide opportunities to direct biological processes. Previously, {{it has been}} demonstrated that enzyme <b>triggered</b> <b>assembly</b> of peptide derivatives can influence bacterial cell death by intracellular fibre formation. In this article, we discuss the self-assembly of 9 -fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected dipeptide amphiphiles, FY, YT, YS, YN and YQ, designing phosphorylated precursors to be alkaline phosphatase responsive. We use microscopy techniques, fluorescence and FTIR to demonstrate differences in molecular assembly and nanoscale architecture in vitro – indicating fibre formation of FY, YT, YS and YN, and spherical self-assembled structures of YQ. As the enzyme is naturally occurring in E. coli, we manipulate conditions to over-express the enzyme and demonstrate the conversion of precursors to self-assembling aromatic peptide amphiphiles in vivo. Furthermore, we test whether antimicrobial activity can be differentially controlled {{by the introduction of}} varying aromatic peptide amphiphiles, with the results indicating a similar antimicrobial response for each treatment...|$|R
