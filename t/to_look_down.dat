5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard {{but it has been}} transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

Nevertheless, they placed many lookouts and created an electric alarm system to warn the builders of approaching guards.|$|R

25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at the instrument panel. Technically, it measures sideslip angle, not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the sideslip angle to zero.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} shows that consumers select a different product when they <b>look</b> <b>down</b> versus up. Because (1) people are accustomed <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> process nearby stimuli and <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> up <b>to</b> process distant stimuli, and because (2) perceived distance is linked to concrete versus abstract processing, the association between moving one's eyes or head down or up and concrete versus abstract processing has become overly generalized. A series of three experiments highlights that downward (upward) head and eye movements evoke more concrete (abstract) processing because downward (upward) head or eye movements have come {{to serve as a}} proximity (distance) cue. Two additional experiments indicate downstream behavioral consequences of moving one's eyes or head down versus up. Consumers choose more for feasible versus desirable products when <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> and vice versa when looking up. They also tend to be more preference-consistent when <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> versus up...|$|R

They separated in 1985, after which Tony bought a house in disuse at Number 3 Albert Square and set about making it habitable, leaving Hannah to move in with another man. Kelvin soon joined Tony on the square, although it took him a lot to persuade his wife to allow him custody of their son.|$|E
25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the use of blue {{because of the fact that}} judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E
25|$|In Dante's fourteenth-century work La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy), Purgatory is {{depicted}} as a mountain in the Southern hemisphere. It is apparently the only land there. Souls who loved God and man half-heartedly find themselves at Mount Purgatory, where there are two levels, then Seven Levels representing the Seven Deadly Sins with ironic punishments. For example, on the first level for Pride, the penitents are weighed down by huge stones. This forces them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> in humility at the pavement, which depicts examples of sinful Pride such as Arachne. When they reach the top, souls will find themselves at Jerusalem's antipode, the Garden of Eden itself. Thus, cleansed of all sin and made perfect, they wait in this Earthly paradise before ascending to Heaven.|$|E

25|$|What they {{objected to}} was {{arbitrary}} obstacles, artificial limitations upon {{the freedom of}} each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve preëminence gave to the successful ones no right <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority {{as a matter of}} pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Oculus VR {{announced}} at The Game Awards {{that they would}} be partnering with Harmonix to make a virtual reality Rock Band game for the Rift titled Rock Band VR, to be released in 2016. Harmonix began work on the title in October 2015. The game, focused solely on guitar players, uses the Oculus Rift Touch controllers in addition to the headset, one which is attached to the guitar controller. These provide the player with a first-person view of their guitarist on stage which reacts to the player's movements. In a demonstration at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, the game was set up so that the player could see the note tracks located on the floor monitors on the virtual stage, requiring the player <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> to track them, but Harmonix stated they were exploring other means to provide this input. The player can engage other actions in the VR world by looking at certain stage elements, such as by keeping their focus on a foot pedal, they can activate pyrotechnics on the virtual stage. The game was released on March 23, 2017 and shipped with 60 songs on release.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
