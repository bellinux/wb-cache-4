5|$|Huge drums are {{arranged}} in rows {{in front of the}} palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers, who dance on <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b> Sasankan is impressed with Chandralekha's performance but, unknown to him, Veerasimhan's soldiers are hiding inside <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b> As the dance ends, they rush out and attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan confronts Sasankan, and their lengthy sword fight ends with Sasankan's defeat and imprisonment. Veerasimhan releases his parents and becomes the new king, with Chandralekha as his queen.|$|E
5|$|A Tahitian {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. <b>The</b> <b>drums</b> consist of a slit-log drum called tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called fa‘atete, a single-headed hand drum called pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed bass drum called tariparau.|$|E
5|$|After the 1st verse and chorus, {{there is}} an a cappella moment, in which Jackson {{breathes}} to <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> and the bass, then the strings, then spins, drops down and claps, then he main song starts with the 2nd verse.|$|E
50|$|Mercury clocks used a drum {{with several}} {{chambers}} that were connected through calibrated holes. A rope was wound around <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> with a weight connected to one end. The weight pulling down turned <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> and <b>the</b> mercury in <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> chambers resisted <b>the</b> turning motion by slowly flowing from one segment of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> to <b>the</b> next, thus inhibiting {{the movement of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and making it turn at {{a more or less}} constant speed. The movement of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> could be used to measure time.|$|R
50|$|Transfer: The {{resulting}} {{toner image}} {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> is transferred from <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> onto a piece of paper with a higher negative charge than <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coincident with 58 {{tracks were}} 67 read heads and 13 write heads. While <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> was {{spinning}} at 6,000 rpm, the heads floated {{above the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> on {{a thin layer of}} air. When <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> was spinning up or slowing down, the heads were raised off <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> by camshafts rotated by a chain that was driven by a motor on top of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> housing, to avoid scoring the magnetic surface. See Figure 3.|$|R
5|$|Agent Orange {{was tested}} by the United States in Thailand {{during the war in}} Southeast Asia. Buried drums were {{uncovered}} and confirmed to be Agent Orange in 1999. Workers who uncovered <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> fell ill while upgrading the airport near Hua Hin District, 100km south of Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|An 1848 {{inventory}} lists 6 large cannons, 21 small cannons, 6 breech-loaders, and 8 {{which did}} not work. The fort stored quantities of gunpowder, guns, rifles, and swords, and {{was used as a}} prison. Sailors who docked at Lahaina were subject to a sunset curfew; it they did not return to their ship when <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> sounded they would be imprisoned in the fort.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded <b>the</b> <b>drums,</b> using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
50|$|The {{laser beam}} neutralizes (or reverses) the charge {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> leaving a static {{electric}} negative image on <b>the</b> <b>drum's</b> surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> by <b>the</b> toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll's rubber surface to the uncharged portions of the surface of <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Drum</b> It is {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>Drum</b> {{played a significant}} role in many important wins. <b>The</b> <b>Drum</b> leads <b>the</b> student section during fight songs and chants. Today this tradition lives on with a new generation of drummers.|$|R
50|$|Trommel screens have a {{rotating}} drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around {{the diameter of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> <b>The</b> feed material always sits {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and, as <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.|$|R
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b> I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 2012, at the O2 Academy in Birmingham, Black Sabbath {{played their}} first concert since 2005, with Tommy Clufetos playing <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b> In June, they {{performed}} at Download Festival, {{followed by the}} last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago. Later that month, the band started recording an album.|$|E
5|$|After a demo of {{the song}} was {{approved}} by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b> The recordings were finished by the time Casino Royale finished its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed in the orchestra parts.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in the chorus, where for two bars <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for {{the climax of the}} vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E
5|$|During his {{backstage}} theatre job, Sellers began practising {{on a set}} {{of drums}} that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers's temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>drum</b> [...] "throne" [...] is a {{three or}} four-legged padded seat or stool <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> sits on while playing.

50|$|Bomba is {{described}} to be a challenge/connection between <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> and <b>the</b> dancer. The dancer produces {{a series of}} gestures to which the primo o subidor drummer provides a synchronized beat. Thus, it is <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> who attempts to follow the dancer, and not the more traditional form of the dancer following <b>the</b> <b>drummer.</b> <b>The</b> dancer must be in great physical shape, and the challenge usually continues until either the dancer or <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> discontinues.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{achieved}} the 3 D parameterized model of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> with VB programming in Solid Works CAD software environment, and completed the finite element {{stress and strain}} analysis for <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> structure with ANSYS finite element analysis software. The force and deformation of <b>the</b> driving <b>drum</b> was basically mastered. A full process from 3 D parameterized model to structural analysis for <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> was implemented in this paper. It highly improved <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> design level and efficiency...|$|R
5|$|Eisenberg {{lived with}} his sister Hallie and her boyfriend, Owen Danoff, singer-songwriter and {{contestant}} on season 10 of NBC's The Voice, in New York, until Hallie and Danoff moved to Nashville in June 2016. Eisenberg has been playing <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> since he was 8 years old. In 2007, Eisenberg started an online wordplay website with his cousin, a social design evangelist at Facebook, called OneUpMe. They re-launched the site in 2010, instead exclusively formatted for Facebook users.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Jeff Tweedy {{provided}} the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt, {{the only other}} original member of the band, played bass guitar and added backing vocals. Lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone performed here on a Wilco album for the first time. Glenn Kotche performed on <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> and other percussion instruments, and Mikael Jorgensen played keyboards. Other instrumentation was provided by Patrick Newbery (trumpet and flugelhorn), Nick Broste (trombone), and Rick Parenti (baritone sax).|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>drums,</b> occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
50|$|Care {{for this}} {{instrument}} is peculiar in that <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> heads must {{be exposed to}} moisture to produce a desirable sound. Before playing the tsuzumi, the player will breathe {{very close to the}} head that will be struck. Sometimes he will even take some saliva and apply it to the head of <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> <b>The</b> quality of sound of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> will depend on how much moisture is in the atmosphere where it is being played. To make sure <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> heads are moist, the player will breathe into <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> head at intervals when he is not playing.|$|R
50|$|The Rotopress is a {{continuously}} compacting garbage truck. A massive {{rotating drum}} compacts and stores the garbage. The {{outer edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> acts as <b>the</b> loading hopper, and paddles on <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> convey <b>the</b> waste around an auger of decreasing pitch until it is small enough to be forced through a small ring-shaped gap between <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and <b>the</b> auger, where it then enters the main section of <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> which has helically shaped internal paddles which move the now-crushed waste towards {{the front of the}} vehicle. When emptying <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> <b>the</b> direction of rotation is reversed.|$|R
50|$|A {{cylindrical}} drum and a roller are mounted for rotation with their respective axes horizontal. The {{periphery of the}} roller is adjacent to that of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and has one or more recesses of constant depth. <b>The</b> <b>drum</b> and <b>the</b> roller are rotated at the same peripheral speed. A farinaceous paste, supplied to {{the periphery of the}} roller in a zone remote from <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> is repeatedly taken up by the recess or recesses and is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> in <b>the</b> form of portions, which may be interconnected. The paste on <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> is heated, so that it is at least partially cooked to pastry, and the pastry is removed from <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Shaanxi in {{the north}} of China, drum {{ensembles}} accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians. In Korea, a style of folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.|$|E
5|$|Kumi-daiko performance, {{characterized}} by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of Daihachi Oguchi and has continued with groups such as Kodo. Other performance styles, such as hachijō-daiko, have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. Kumi-daiko performance groups are active not only in Japan, {{but also in the}} United States, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, form, stick grip, clothing, and the particular instrumentation. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped nagadō-daiko as well as smaller shime-daiko. Many groups accompany <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah's {{music is}} written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with {{assistance}} from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs <b>the</b> <b>drums,</b> and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea {{to the other}} members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards. Hagström explains that each member has {{an idea of what}} the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.|$|E
50|$|The maddale is a {{double-sided}} drum {{whose body}} is usually made using a hollowed piece of jackfruit wood {{about half a}} cm thick (this is very thin compared to Mrudangam). This body is called Goodu(or housing). The two open ends of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> are covered with a goat skin leather and laced to each other with leather straps around the circumference of <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> These straps are stretched to tightly hold <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> heads {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> body, allowing them to resonate when struck. <b>The</b> <b>drum</b> head on <b>the</b> left is slightly larger (bass side) (about say 90% of an inch). One side produces bass another treble. <b>The</b> <b>drum</b> head is known as muchchige.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>drum</b> is worn on a sling, {{which is}} carried {{over the right}} shoulder, down to the left hip. By {{mounting}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> on its hoop, it hangs down diagonally to the right, as seen by the drummer.Owing to the diagonal position of <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> <b>the</b> traditional grip must be applied.|$|R
50|$|Turkey Tailfeather Woman was a Dakota {{woman who}} is said to have given <b>the</b> <b>Drum</b> Dance to <b>the</b> Anishinaabe people. <b>The</b> <b>Drum</b> Dance is a set of spiritual beliefs that center on Turkey Tailfeather Woman and her escape from the American military, after which she built a large drum while in hiding. The {{religion}} spread throughout a large swathe of North America after about 1877. <b>The</b> <b>drum</b> used in <b>the</b> <b>Drum</b> Dance is <b>the</b> forerunner of <b>the</b> large <b>drum</b> used in modern powwows.|$|R
