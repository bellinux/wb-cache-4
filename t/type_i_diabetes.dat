25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>diabetes,</b> elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in serum arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent insulin secretion and exocytosis. However, {{research has shown that}} when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in control animals to 35% in experimental animals. Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of L-selectin, sulfatide has been shown to prevent <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>diabetes</b> and inhibit insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Sulfatide also prevents apoptosis in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of interleukin-1 beta (lL-1β), interferon beta 1b (lFN-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that promote apoptosis.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide {{may also}} be {{involved}} in not just <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>diabetes,</b> but also type II diabetes. Specifically, sulfatide is capable of inhibiting TNF-α secretion. When there are low serum levels of sulfatide, as well as elevated production of TNF-α in patients that have type II diabetes, it is commonly associated with insulin resistance. However, sulfatide may mediate suppression of type II diabetes through the activation of potassium protein channels.|$|E

25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, {{and some of}} them are {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>diabetes,</b> ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} the {{documented}} loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity {{is that it is}} almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates nucleoprotein antigens. In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>diabetes)</b> based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the half-life of growth hormone in young adult patients with <b>type</b> <b>I</b> (insulin-dependent) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus following bolus injection and prolonged exposure {{for the purpose}} of deconvolution analysis of plasma growth hormone profiles to determine growth hormone secretory rates. DESIGN: In the bolus study, an intravenous bolus injection of 100 mU of biosynthetic human growth hormone was given while endogenous growth hormone was suppressed by a continuous infusion of somatostatin under three different glucose clamp conditions: normoglycaemia (5 mmol/l) with normoinsulinaemia (65 pmol/l); hyperglycaemia (12 mmol/l) with normoinsulinaemia; and normoglycaemia with hyperinsulinaemia (360 pmol/l). In the infusion study, the effect of prolonged and repeated growth hormone exposure upon the growth hormone half-life was estimated. Three pulses of 60 minutes growth hormone infusion (6 mU/kg/pulse) two hours apart under euglycaemic somatostatin suppression were applied. PATIENTS: Six young adult patients with <b>type</b> <b>I</b> (insulin-dependent) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus were studied in both the bolus and the infusion study. RESULTS: Mean GH half-lives by mono-exponential analysis were not significantly different remaining unaltered by the short-term metabolic changes of hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Data were therefore pooled yielding an overall mean GH half-life of 13. 6 minutes (range 11. 9 - 19. 4). Applying a bi-exponential model mean GH half-lives were 3. 1 minutes (range 2. 5 - 5. 9) for the rapid phase of distribution of the hormone and 13. 8 minutes (range 9. 6 - 16. 9) for the decay of GH from the circulation. The GH half-life during the infusions studies did not vary with repeated exposure but was significantly longer (mean half-life of 25. 7 minutes; range 19. 4 - 37. 1) than during the bolus studies (P less than 0. 001).

METHODS: The study was part of the EURODIAB project. A total of 24 centres, covering a population at risk of more than 15 million children below 15 years of age, recruited 1, 260 children at the time of clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Polyuria, by far the most frequent symptom, was observed in 96 % of the children. In only 25 % of the children was the duration of symptoms less than 2 weeks and this proportion was larger in the under 5 year age-group (37 vs 22 %; p < 0. 001). Of the 11 centres that recorded diabetic ketoacidosis status, the overall proportion with diabetic ketoacidosis (pH < 7. 3) was 40 % (95 %-CI: 36 - 44 %) in at least 90 % of cases. After stratification by centre, the odds ratio for diabetic ketoacidosis in the under 5 age-group was 1. 02 (95 %-CI: 0. 69 - 1. 49) relative to the older children. There was significant variation between the 11 centres in the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis which ranged from 26 to 67 % (p = 0. 002).
