The Vishnudharmottara Purana calls him Vishnu-Vaikuntha. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> {{may be called}} Chaturvyuha ("having four vyuhas"), when {{identified}} with the four manifestations or vyuhas of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconographic}} 16th century work Shilparatna, the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – {{most of them}} of South Indian origin – {{describe the}} iconography of Ardhanarishvara. The right superior {{side of the body}} usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school, the feminine holds the dominant right side. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> usually is prescribed to have four, three or two arms, but rarely is depicted with eight arms. In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b>|$|E
5|$|A cow, {{identified}} with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya. In {{relation to the}} deity's iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta (the five classical elements) in <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow {{in one of his}} hands.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> is unclear: although the early image {{has been interpreted}} as a bust of the Christ Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E
5|$|From 2001 to 2015, the Sorcerer's Hat was <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> of Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of {{the four}} theme parks located at Walt Disney World Resort.

Also located at the resort is Fantasia Gardens, a miniature golf course that integrates characters and objects from the film in each hole.

5|$|On 29 June 626, {{a coordinated}} {{assault on the}} walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city {{against the forces of}} some 80,000 Avars and Slavs. Despite {{continuous}} bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions along the wall with <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> of the Virgin Mary, inspiring the belief that the Byzantines were under divine protection.|$|E

5|$|The crown {{over the}} lion and sun {{configuration}} consolidated {{the association of}} the symbol with the monarchy. The sun lost its importance as <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> of kingship and the Kiani Crown became the primary symbol of the Qajar monarchy. Under Nasir al-Din Shah, logos varied from seated, swordless lions to standing and sword-bearing lions. In February 1873, the decree for Order of Aftab (Nishan-i Afab) was issued by Nasi-al Din Shah.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>icon</b> of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand, Dacians have {{a significant role in}} creating a history of an ethnically pure origin for Romanian people. However, at the same time, they have a much more relegated role in describing Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation, less so than Romans do.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in Kashmir and north West India predating 10th century suggests {{the worship of}} Vishnu in this form in the era. The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE. The 12th century chronicle Rajatarangini also mentions about the installation of this form of Vishnu. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> received royal patronage from King Avantivarman, the founder of Utpala dynasty (reign: 855-883 CE); temples built in his reign often depict Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti became the tutelary deity of the Karkotas and Utpala dynasties of Kashmir. It was also popular in the regions adjoining Kashmir.|$|E
5|$|Two iconographical {{forms of}} Varaha are popular. Yajna Varaha - {{denoting}} Yajna (sacrifice) - is {{seated on a}} lion-throne and flanked by his consorts Bhudevi and Lakshmi. As Pralaya Varaha - indicative of lifting the earth from {{the stage of the}} pralaya (the dissolution of the universe), he is depicted only with Bhudevi. Varaha may be depicted with Lakshmi alone too. In such sculptures, he may be depicted identical to Vishnu in terms of iconography with Vishnu's attributes; the boar head identifying <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> as Varaha. Lakshmi may be seated on his thigh in such portrayals.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four-headed {{aspect of}} the Hindu god Vishnu, mostly found in Kashmir (northern part of the Indian subcontinent). <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head. Sometimes, even three-headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E

5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> and forced Paul to return to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a holy war, carried war flags with <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E

5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male part of <b>the</b> <b>icon.</b> The torso, hip and pelvis {{of the female}} is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a four-headed Vishnu first appears in the Hindu epic Mahabharata, but the {{complete}} iconography was first found in a 5th-century Pancharatra text. <b>The</b> <b>icon</b> reflects influences from the Gupta period and the Gandhara architectural tradition. While as per one interpretation, the animal heads represent Vishnu's avatar Narasimha (lion-headed man) and Varaha (boar), another theory based on Pancharatra texts relates the four heads to Chaturvyuha - Vasudeva (Krishna), Samkarshana (Balarama), Pradyumna and Aniruddha - four vyuhas (manifestations) of Vishnu. A cult centered on Vaikuntha Chaturmurti developed in Kashmir in the 8-12th century, when the deity also enjoyed royal patronage in the region. The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho suggests his worship in the Chandela kingdom (Central India) in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in <b>the</b> <b>icon</b> may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
