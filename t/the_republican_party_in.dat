During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman. However, Oklahoma Democrats were {{generally considered to be}} more conservative than Democrats in other states.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Republicano Independiente) was a {{political}} <b>party</b> <b>in</b> Cuba, led by Juan Gualberto Gómez. It was formed around 1900, after splits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>in</b> Havana, Matanzas and Las Villas. The split {{was caused by the}} opposition of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> to Gualberto Gómez's radical position against the Platt Amendment. <b>The</b> Independent <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> supported Gualberto Gómez's position on the issue.|$|R

The king fled the country without abdicating and a republic was established.|$|R
5|$|Taylor {{became a}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> 1884. In 1886, he was chosen to {{represent}} the third district on the Republican state central committee. That same year, the party nominated a full slate of candidates for county offices, including Taylor as the nominee for county judge. In the ensuing elections, the full Republican slate was elected. Taylor was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888. He was re-elected as county judge in 1890.|$|E
5|$|William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801 – October 10, 1872) was United States Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869, {{and earlier}} served as Governor of New York and United States Senator. A {{determined}} {{opponent of the}} spread of slavery in the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War, he was a dominant figure in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> its formative years, and was praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>In</b> 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E

5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Steve Neal, McNary's biographer, {{describes}} McNary as {{a progressive}} who stuck with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> 1910 even when many progressives left {{the party in}} favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the direct election of US senators) of Oregonian William Simon U'Ren, {{and he was an}} early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies. After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

5|$|The Moderate Party has a pro-European Union policy stance—including {{support for}} exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also {{supports}} Sweden joining NATO. As one of Europe's new conservative leaders, Reinfeldt {{is seen as}} an important ally of the United States. His party {{is a member of the}} conservative International Democrat Union, together with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> the United States and the British Conservative Party, even though its policies are somewhat more liberal than these. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004, Reinfeldt like a large majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>in</b> Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
