5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> NFL Cheerleaders {{are simply}} known as <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> Cheerleaders. In 2005, {{cheerleader}} Kristin Gauvin won Miss Massachusetts, {{in part from}} her local commitment with <b>the</b> <b>Patriots.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because Montgomery was now {{tied to the}} Livingston family, who {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> cause, he began to turn against the British government, seeing himself as an American instead of an Englishman. He {{came to believe that}} the British government was being oppressive and was acting like a tyrannical parent-state.|$|E

5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members. Fourteen years later, federal {{prosecutors}} used <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> Act's expansion of currency transaction reporting requirements to indict Hastert on federal charges.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{obtained}} <b>the</b> Miami Dolphins' fifth-round pick (147th overall) {{in exchange}} for two of <b>the</b> <b>Patriot's</b> sixth-round picks (196th overall and 204th overall) and <b>the</b> <b>Patriot's</b> seventh-round pick (250th overall).|$|R
5|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> faced <b>the</b> Colts, quarterbacked now by Andrew Luck, on November 18; <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Colts 59–24. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> also beat <b>the</b> Colts on January 12, 2014, 43–22. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> played <b>the</b> Colts in {{the playoffs}} again on January 18, 2015, in the AFC title game, winning 45–7.|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{paid tribute}} to Bengals {{defensive}} tackle Devon Still, whose daughter is battling cancer, with a short film during a television timeout saluting his daughter while <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> cheerleaders donned Devon Still #75 jerseys; the gesture and donation by the Kraft family to the Cincinnati hospital at which she is being treated, brought a standing ovation and moved Still to tears. With <b>the</b> win, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> advanced to 3-2, making many rethink the [...] "death" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>Patriots.</b> <b>The</b> 505 total yards of offense was <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> highest output of <b>the</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> forced <b>the</b> Bengals into three turnovers (all fumbles) while <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> didnt turn it over at all. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> dominated time of possession by almost 18 minutes and first downs 30-17. Tom Brady returned to form going 23/35 for 285 yards and 2 TDs and 0 INTs. Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen combined for 203 rushing yards on 36 carries as <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> ran for 220 on the night.|$|R
5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for <b>the</b> <b>patriot</b> armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E
5|$|During the Campaign of Guayana, General Manuel Piar fights {{against the}} realists {{to seize the}} {{missions}} {{of the kingdom of}} Spain.

From 1830 many indigenous and other populations began to emerge around Tumeremo.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{had arrived}} in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis' main force. Ferguson issued a {{challenge}} to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> led 17-7 at the half; in {{the second}} half, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> scored 28 points for a final score of 45-7. [...] It was the 50th win by <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> in <b>the</b> rivalry. Given the {{crushing}} victory by <b>the</b> <b>Patriots,</b> there is a consensus that the Colts would still have lost even if the footballs were properly inflated.|$|R
25|$|In <b>the</b> postseason, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> first hosted their {{division}} rivals, the New York Jets, in the Wild Card Round. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> defeated <b>the</b> Jets 37–16, as Brady went 22–34 for 212 {{yards and}} two touchdowns. In the Divisional Round, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> traveled to San Diego {{to take on the}} Chargers. This was Brady's first playoff game {{in his home state of}} California. Brady and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> struggled against <b>the</b> Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI. With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> down by eight points, Brady and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> started a key drive that would ultimately decide the game. After a 49-yard pass play to wide receiver Reche Caldwell, a Stephen Gostkowski field goal gave <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> a 24–21 win.|$|R
5000|$|Grogan {{was named}} to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 35th Anniversary Team in 1994, and was elected into <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> Hall of Fame in 1995. He was also elected to <b>the</b> <b>Patriot's</b> All-Decade teams of the 1970s and the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, the ACLU {{sued the}} federal {{government}} in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider.

In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.|$|E
5|$|Needing to hurry, <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> militia put 900 men {{on horseback}} and rode for Kings Mountain.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> traded a {{conditional}} seventh-round pick to the Baltimore Ravens for linebacker Prescott Burgess in September 2009. He was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{six days}} later. Since the trade was conditioned on Burgess being active {{for a certain}} number of games, and since Burgess was inactive in the only game for which he was with <b>the</b> <b>Patriots,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> kept <b>the</b> pick.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{were far}} from {{outstanding}} on offense. Brady finished 23/35 but for just 146 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> combined for just 85 rushing yards on 24 carries, but the defense came through again. The Jets once again out-gained <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> in total yards, but yet again, couldn't score touchdowns, and fell to big plays by <b>the</b> <b>Patriots.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{both teams}} punted on their opening drive, Edelman gave <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> decent field {{position}} with a 30-yard return to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 36. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> drove to <b>the</b> Jets 21, but Gostkowski missed the 39-yard field goal. Starting {{at their own}} 30, the Jets drove to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 23, but Sanchez was intercepted by Gregory at <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 15. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> proceeded to march 84 yards in 15 plays, scoring on the first play of the second quarter. After driving to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 31, Shonn Greene fumbled Gregory recovering at <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 19. Brady dumped off a short pass to Vereen out of the backfield, who ran untouched down the sideline 83 yards for a touchdown, increasing <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> lead to 14-0. On the second play of the Jets next drive, Sanchez ran up the middle, but ran into his offensive line and fumbled (creating the infamous butt fumble) with Gregory returning it 32 yards for a touchdown, giving <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> a 21-0 lead. Joe McKnight fumbled the ensuing kickoff right {{into the hands of}} Edelman, who returned it 22 yards for a touchdown, giving <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> a 28-0 lead. The Jets drove 41 yards to their own 43, but Mayo sacked Sanchez for a 9-yard loss and the Jets punted. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> raced 73 yards in just 4 plays, scoring on a 56-yard touchdown bomb to Edelman, giving <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> a 35-0 lead. The Jets drove to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 14 and Folk got <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> on <b>the</b> board with a 32-yard field goal. For the second week in a row, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> tied a franchise record set in their 2009 Week 6 game against the Tennessee Titans—in this case, 35 second-quarter points, including three touchdown in 52 seconds. Unlike the Titans game, though, where <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> held <b>the</b> ball for 9 minutes and 22 seconds, in this quarter <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> held <b>the</b> ball for just 2 minutes and 14 seconds, with the offense running just six plays in the entire quarter. After a Jets punt, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> drove to <b>the</b> Jets 46, but Edelman fumbled with LaRon Landry recovering at the Jets 43. The Jets drove to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 1-yard line, but Greene was stuffed for no gain on 4th-and-1. A penalty for a chop-block on Ridley in the end zone led to a safety, making the score 35-5 and giving the Jets the ball. The Jets marched 71 yards in 4 plays, scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bilal Powell, making the score 35-12. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> countered with a 17 play, 86-yard marathon, taking seven-and-a-half minutes off the clock and scoring on Brady's 1-yard touchdown run a few minutes into the fourth quarter. On the Jets next drive, Sanchez hit Chaz Schilens for a 22-yard gain to the Jets 45, but Dennard forced him to fumble at the 40 with Ninkovich returning it to the Jets 37. A 28-yard completion to Welker and a 9-yard run by Ridley gave <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> a 49-12 lead. Two possessions later, Sanchez hit Keller for a 1-yard touchdown. After a <b>Patriots</b> punt, <b>the</b> Jets ran out {{of the rest of the}} clock and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> won <b>the</b> game.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-show of WrestleMania XXX, the Real Americans {{were the}} final team {{eliminated}} during a fatal-four-way {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> Lock before Colter demanded that the duo shake hands. Cesaro instead retaliated with a Cesaro Swing on Swagger. Later during the pay-per-view, Cesaro was a surprise entrant in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which he won by last eliminating Big Show by body slamming {{him out of the}} ring, which mirrored Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André. Swagger retaliated by attacking Cesaro on the following Raw and then destroying the trophy, thus ending the stable.|$|E
5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining <b>the</b> <b>patriot</b> armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
50|$|Looker {{made the}} final opening day roster with <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> but {{was listed as}} inactive. On November 16, 2000, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> placed Looker on injured reserve due to a leg injury. On July 31, 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> waived Looker.|$|R
50|$|Mallett {{was listed}} as the #2 quarterback on <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> depth chart behind Tom Brady and ahead of 3rd string quarterback Tim Tebow, Tebow would later be {{released}} by <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> leaving Mallett as <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> only backup quarterback.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> {{released}} Eckel on August 26, 2008, in {{the first}} round of preseason cuts. He was re-signed to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> roster on September 15, 2008, the day after their Week 2 game. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> again released Eckel on September 22.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of <b>the</b> <b>patriot</b> army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one {{of seven}} members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) {{who voted against the}} Amash-Conyers {{amendment}} to limit Section 215 of <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|San Martín did {{not take}} hostages or ask for ransoms, but rather he {{instructed}} his people to avoid further conflicts {{and to try to}} restore peaceful relations with the royalists. Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas at stake in the Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined <b>the</b> <b>patriot</b> forces under San Martín's command during his administration in Mendoza.|$|E
25|$|In the AFC Championship, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> faced <b>the</b> Indianapolis Colts. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> and Colts {{had faced}} each other twice in the {{previous}} three postseasons at Foxborough; this game, however, was played at Indianapolis. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> led at halftime, 21–6; however, the Colts and Peyton Manning staged a comeback, culminating in a last minute interception thrown by Brady, and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> lost <b>the</b> game to the Colts, 34–38.|$|R
50|$|Steve Nelson played linebacker for <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> from 1974-87 {{and became}} the nucleus of <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> defense.

5000|$|The Jaguars {{surprised}} <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> by storming 78 {{yards in}} 9 plays {{to take an}} early 7-0 lead on a Chad Henne 3-yard touchdown pass to Justin Blackmon. On the third play of their first drive Brady was intercepted by Chris Prosinski at the Jaguars 43 who returned it 4 yards to the 47. The Jaguars reached <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 23, and Josh Scobee came on a drilled a 41-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 10-0. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> got going on their next drive, marching {{all the way to}} the Jags 7, but could only get a field goal out of it. Henne continued to carve update <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> secondary, reaching Patriots territory on a 36-yard bomb to Jordan Shipley, but <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> defense held and Scobee missed a 43-yard field goal, keeping the score 10-3. However, once again on the third play of <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> next drive, Brady was intercepted by Derek Cox. The Jaguars took advantage, driving to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 17 and Scobee kicked his second field goal, extending the Jaguars surprising lead to 13-3. Two possession later, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> marched to <b>the</b> Jaguars 30 and Gostkowski was good on a 48-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>Patriots</b> forced <b>the</b> Jags to punt again on their next drive, and once again <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> took advantage, marching 66 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Woodhead with :18 seconds remaining in the first half, tying the game at 13-13. Henne completed a pass to Shipley to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 40, but time expired.After receiving the opening kick-off, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> drove to <b>the</b> Jaguars 20 and took the lead 16-13 on a 38-yard Gostkowski field goal. Two possessions later, at midfield, Henne was intercepted by Marquice Cole at <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 40. Two possessions later, after Welker returned a punt 16 yards to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 41, <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> marched 59 yards in 9 plays, scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, increasing the lead to 23-13. The Jaguars responded on their very next drive reaching <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 24 and trimming the deficit to 23-16 on a 42-yard field goal by Scobee, his third. After a <b>Patriots</b> punt <b>the</b> Jags stormed to Pats the 1-yard line. On 1st down, Greg Jones was tackled for no gain. On 2nd down, Zach Potter was flagged for a false start moving the ball to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 5. An incompletion and 5-yard sack followed bring up 4th-and-Goal at the 10. On the next play, Chung intercepted Henne in the end zone and returned it 27 yards to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 28. <b>The</b> Jaguars forced <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> to punt and got the ball back at their own 38 with :54 seconds left. An unnecessary roughness penalty on Chung coupled with completions of 17 and 18 yards to Toney Clemons and Jordan Shipley, respectively moved the ball to <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> 12 yard line. However, Henne was intercepted by Chung again, who kneeled for a touchback and <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> escaped with <b>the</b> win. The win, however, left <b>the</b> <b>Patriots</b> angry; Tom Brady criticized his teammates following the game, saying [...] "We didn't compete," [...] and his postgame press conference was unusually short.|$|R
