5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> are {{aspects of}} sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in}} which MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{interpretations of}} the {{original}} intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, {{as well as the}} customs and understandings prevalent at that time. Some of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> that have arisen about this clause are {{the extent to which it}} included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present in the United States when they have a child, whether the clause allows revocation of citizenship, and whether the clause applies to illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> that faced Maxwell and the justices primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1968 election, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted {{in parts of the}} metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been a bastion of the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of Murray gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, Tom Stott, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{factions of}} the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like Edward Raczyński, who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy. During {{the two or}} so decades of its existence, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> of concern of the Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly the discrimination against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary. The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the Germanization campaign. As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to dissent in the province, which eventually resulted in an uprising in 1848 {{in the midst of}} the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The Sejm met the total of seven times before the revolutions of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845). Following the revolutions, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the Prussian Parliament. The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.|$|E
5|$|With the new consensus, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> {{concerning}} Poland and Germany {{were settled}} in {{the second week of}} February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E

A year out from the poll, the light rail project was already predicted to be <b>the</b> election's <b>major</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>The</b> election saw the Labor government returned, with the party claiming the result as an endorsement of the project. As predicted, the light rail project was <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>the</b> campaign.|$|R
25|$|The Commission on Presidential Debates held four debates {{during the}} last weeks of the campaign: three presidential and one vice-presidential. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> debated were the economy and jobs, the federal budget deficit, {{taxation}} and spending, the future of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, healthcare reform, education, social issues, immigration, and foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{objections}} of CPT include {{the amount of}} heat produced for the rapid plate movements, {{and the fact that}} the cooling of hot oceanic plates and the raising of continental plates would take a great deal of time and require multiple small scale catastrophes after the flood ended.

25|$|In Reconstruction, how to {{deal with}} the ex Confederates and the freed slaves, or freedmen, were <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues.</b> By 1864, Radical Republicans {{controlled}} Congress and demanded more aggressive action against slavery and more vengeance toward the Confederates. Lincoln held them off, but just barely as Republicans at first welcomed President Andrew Johnson. while the Radicals thought he was one of them and would take a hard line in punishing the South.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> during ElBaradei’s {{second term}} as the {{director}} general of the IAEA was the agency’s inspections in Iraq.

ElBaradei told the UN Security Council in March 2003 that documents purporting to show that Iraq had tried to acquire uranium from Niger were not authentic.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{dangerous}} tactic, one which could have broken the union {{if not for the}} support of Vice President Richard Nixon. Nixon planned to run for president in 1960, and offered his services in the hopes of negotiating a settlement which might win him labor's backing. The Board of Inquiry, meanwhile, reconvened on November 10 and issued a second report on January 6, 1960. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues,</b> the Board said, remained the size of the wage increase and Section 2(b).|$|E

He returned from England and served as Secretary from August 8, 1831 to May 28, 1833. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>issues</b> confronting McLane in this new role were the tariffs rates {{and the status of}} the Second Bank of the United States.|$|E
