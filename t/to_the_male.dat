5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} share it with his brothers.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} the events of , Agent Peggy Carter is {{now a member of}} the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR). She faces sexism from her boss, Agent John Flynn, who treats her condescendingly and keeps her {{compiling}} data and code breaking while assigning field cases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> agents. The SSR's main concern is the mysterious Zodiac, which they have been unable to recover for some time.|$|E
5|$|Presented with a jewelled brooch as a {{farewell}} gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social {{work at the}} University of Sydney. The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of inheritance, it is made very clear that all {{property}} belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> in <b>the</b> family. This also means that all debt also belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of <b>the</b> family.|$|R

50|$|Threefin {{blennies}} are diurnal and territorial; {{many species}} exhibit sexual dichromatism, with the females drab compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> second dorsal fin is also extended in <b>the</b> <b>males</b> of some species. Small invertebrates comprise {{the bulk of}} the threefin blenny diet.|$|R
5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, S.e.asiatica, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.|$|E
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak {{is similar to the}} male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|E
50|$|The female is brown-grey above, {{becoming}} dirty white below. The tail {{pattern is}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>male's</b> plumage is dark grey above {{with black}} wingtips {{and a white}} rump. The underparts are pale grey, with a rufous {{streaked}} belly. The female's plumage is brown above, with a white rump, and cream coloured underneath, with a streaked belly similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> <b>The</b> female is larger than <b>the</b> <b>male</b> with an average size of 46 cm compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> 40 cm. <b>The</b> wingspan is 90 - 115 cm. Since the 44.5 cm tail comprises about 56% of this raptor's total length, this species ties with the long-tailed hawk as the raptor with the longest tail relative to its body size.|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} become a fashionable pet due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> coloration, which resembles the comic-book superhero Spider-Man.|$|R
5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently and listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> filmmakers. Her only role {{is to be an}} object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call {{individually}} or {{there may be a}} chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the common tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax), reply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E

50|$|The female is {{attracted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> display post by his raspy 'yaars' call, {{which becomes}} softer and more tuneful during the display.|$|R
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{being sexually}} aggressive, [...] females of P. dominula demonstrate ways <b>to</b> weed out <b>the</b> low-quality <b>males.</b> Females are typically {{larger and more}} dominant than males, so females exert strong choice by rejecting males. One way they reject males is to express aggressive behaviors such as biting, darting, or stinging <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> <b>male</b> from copulating with her. Another way is to remain still while <b>the</b> <b>male</b> mounts, but move her abdomen <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> genitalia entering her body. Females are also known to mate with multiple males, especially with non-nest mates. They fly over to different males' nests <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> best-quality <b>males</b> and generally copulate with <b>the</b> resident <b>males.</b> That males are resident males often implies that they are large, sexually active and aggressive – providing better protection for her and the brood.|$|R
50|$|The female is brown, {{becoming}} somewhat paler below. The tail {{pattern is}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's,</b> but <b>the</b> ground colour is buff rather than white.|$|R
50|$|Adult females mostly {{respond to}} conspecific signals. Females that {{are from a}} {{different}} host plant than <b>the</b> <b>male</b> rarely responds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> signals. If they do respond, {{there is even a}} lower chance of mating success.|$|R
5|$|In {{the high}} school section, {{students}} in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) must wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankle. The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long beige trousers with a beige shirt, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> students in the college section. College girls wear a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male</b> identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
50|$|Males {{and females}} are easily differentiated. <b>The</b> <b>males</b> are always black with {{a pattern of}} white spots and stripes. Females often bear similar {{patterns}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> but range in color from shades of gray to a vivid orange.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} English name, the {{scientific}} name also refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> obvious white neck crescent, being {{derived from the}} Latin words turdus, [...] "thrush", and torquatus, [...] "collared".|$|R
60|$|Giard {{has always}} {{observed}} that the musky odour, which is emitted by two species of Sphinx moths, is peculiar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> (4. 'Zoological Record,' 1869, p. 347.); and in the higher classes we shall meet with many instances of <b>the</b> <b>males</b> alone being odoriferous.|$|R
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female is very similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of}} the plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E
5|$|The face, lores, throat, breast, {{belly and}} rump {{of this species}} are white; the undersides are tinged with grey on the chest and yellow on the belly. The crown is glossy black in males. The nape is pale grey with a grey-white to white band {{separating}} the crown from the back. The wings are dusky greyish brown with white edging on the inner remiges and wing-coverts. The tail is dusky brown, and the stout bill, iris and legs are black. The female is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but is duller overall and has a chestnut-tinged crown. Juvenile birds resemble adults but have greyish napes and more chestnut in the crown, and the feathers of the back, rump and primaries are scalloped with ochre. The secondaries on the wing and the tail feathers are edged with white.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are similar, but {{females are}} larger and heavier (840 g {{compared}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>male's</b> 650 g). Immature birds have extensive black spotting on the upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts.|$|R
50|$|Spawning season {{can extend}} from February <b>to</b> June. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> creates a nest under debris such as logs or garbage, {{and the female}} lays many eggs, from a few hundred up <b>to</b> 11,000. <b>The</b> <b>male</b> guards <b>the</b> nest. He may breed {{with more than one}} female per season.|$|R
50|$|Females {{are warm}} brown above, paler below, have an orange rump and tail sides, {{and have a}} large white wing patch similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> Bill, eye, legs and feet are black in both sexes.|$|R
