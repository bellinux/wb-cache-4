25|$|Instead of painting, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the bas-relief could also be heated and used <b>to</b> <b>scorch</b> an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object – thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.|$|E
25|$|After the {{occupation}} of Norway by Nazi Germany, mining continued under German administration until January 1942. As part of Operation Nordlicht in October 1944, Kirkenes was scorched, causing extensive damage to the mining company's infrastructure. Most of the facilities were bombed, and what was not bombed was burnt or blasted. A notable exception was the two power stations, which the Germans {{did not have time}} <b>to</b> <b>scorch.</b> Sydvaranger was hindered from starting its reconstruction until the damages had been priced, which was completed in September 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific dock stood {{just north}} of Colman Dock {{at the foot of}} Marion Street. The {{original}} dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. It was not there for long. On July 30, 1914, it was swept away by an explosion and massive fire. The cause has never been determined. Five people died and 29 more were injured. The flames were hot enough <b>to</b> <b>scorch</b> several parts of Colman Dock, but the fire department managed to contain the fire largely to the one pier. A replacement dock was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.|$|E

25|$|In their {{conquest of}} China, {{particularly}} the north under Jur'chen Jin, the Mongols resorted <b>to</b> <b>scorched</b> earth policies, destroying entire provinces. Mongol forces carried out massacres in cities they captured, and one Khan proposed that all Chinese under Mongol rule be killed and their lands turned to pasture, but was persuaded against this by his minister Yelu Chucai, who proposed that taxing the region's inhabitants was more advantageous than killing them.|$|R
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{struggle}} are explicit in the Bibliotheca: realizing {{that he could not}} defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew Iolaus for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by Athena) of using a firebrand <b>to</b> <b>scorch</b> the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. The Hydra's one immortal head was cut off with a golden sword given to Heracles by Athena. Heracles placed the headstill alive and writhingunder a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius, and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood. Thus his second task was complete.|$|E
25|$|However, Falena's {{grip on the}} runes {{has gone}} {{somewhat}} awry. Two {{years prior to the}} start of Suikoden V, residents of Lordlake rioted and charged the East Palace, near the capital of Sol-Falena. In the confusion, the Dawn Rune, which was housed there, was stolen. Lordlake had previously been considered the most loyal of all the towns to the royal government and granted special privileges. With this seeming act of high treason by Lordlake, Arshtat took the Sun Rune upon herself, normally stored in Sol-Falena's palace on a pedestal, and used the Rune's power <b>to</b> <b>scorch</b> Lordlake's vegetation, wildlife, and river, killing its leader Lord Rovere in the process. Since bearing the Sun Rune, the normally compassionate Arshtat has grown more and more erratic in behavior, prone to mood swings and wild fits of vengeance.|$|E
500|$|The {{species that}} {{is causing the}} most {{impediment}} to restoration is the Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum), introduced in 1965. The fern grows rapidly and thickly on the ground, making passage for land animals such as black bears and panthers problematic. The ferns also grow as vines into taller portions of trees, and fires climb the ferns in [...] "fire ladders" [...] <b>to</b> <b>scorch</b> portions of the trees that are not naturally resistant to fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} the trees is retarded if the {{temperature}} is below 20 C. The ideal temperature range for growing and producing fruits is 25-35 C with a relative humidity over 80%. The maximal temperature is 38-40 C, with both leaves and fruit being susceptible <b>to</b> <b>scorching</b> and sunburn, while the minimum temperature is 3-5 C. Young seedlings prefer {{a high level of}} shade and mature trees are shade-tolerant.|$|R
50|$|Viewed {{in terms}} of land mass, Spain {{is one of the}} largest {{countries}} of Western Europe, and it ranks second {{in terms of}} its elevation, after Switzerland. A large part of the country is semiarid, with temperatures that range from extremely cold in the winter <b>to</b> <b>scorching</b> in the summer. Rainfall, which is often inadequate, tends to be concentrated in two generally brief periods during the year. Summer droughts occur frequently.|$|R
