Just past Dina you will drive over a railway overpass, stay {{to the right of the}} road and take the first U-turn to drive back towards Dina. After about 100 meters <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> you will find a signpost, which {{indicates}} the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe. Drive on the road to enter into the fort and keep driving till you reach the parking area.|$|E
2500|$|Section 8: Once {{over the}} beck turn right for approx 100 metres uphill {{to reach a}} wide track and turn left to follow the high path through the woods.

6000|$|... "That all depends, sir. It comes {{easier to}} some than others. If {{you know how}} <b>to</b> shoot <b>your</b> <b>left</b> out {{straight}}, that's as good as six months' teaching. After that it's all ring-craft. The straight left beats the world." ...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 20th century, HLS {{was often}} {{believed}} to be a competitive environment. For example, Dean Berring of University of California, Berkeley School of Law once stated that he [...] "view Harvard Law School as a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation." [...] When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard University President Charles Eliot told him to make it [...] "hard and long." [...] The school's competitive culture gave rise to the urban legend of a dean at the school telling incoming students, [...] "Look <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> look to your right, because one of you won't be here {{by the end of the}} year." [...] Scott Turow's memoir One L and John Jay Osborn's novel The Paper Chase describe such an environment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; that's {{not very}} {{difficult}} now. Go a-head; take the second turning to your right, {{and the third}} <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> and you're landed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{merchant}} laughed. [...] "If you go down-stairs {{into the}} office, {{and go through}} the door <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand, you will find yourself in a telegraph office." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is still}} a chance; {{it may be in}} time; yes, I am almost sure that I can save you."

[...] "Be so good as <b>to</b> bare <b>your</b> <b>left</b> arm," [...] he said; [...] "fortunately, I have the stuff with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|These are {{the most}} common steps to achieve a Single Spey cast (when {{standing}} on the left bank of the river i.e. when looking downstream the bank you are standing on or nearest <b>to</b> is on <b>your</b> <b>left)</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} hear that story about {{the man from the}} West?" [...] asked Billinger, in the little dark-oak room <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> as you {{penetrate}} the interior of the Powhatan Club.|$|E
50|$|If {{coming from}} the Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP), look out for Taman Tun Dr Ismail on <b>your</b> <b>left.</b> When you see the {{intersection}} leading <b>to</b> it on <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> turn right instead towards the 1 Utama shopping centre, and Bandar Utama Damansara. If {{coming from the}} opposite direction, look out for the pink facade of 1 Utama on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and turn left at the appropriate intersection.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{ought not}} <b>to</b> have <b>left</b> <b>your</b> work <b>to</b> come and ask that question,” said his father. “I am afraid {{you are not}} doing very well. I gave you all the {{necessary}} instructions. Go back <b>to</b> <b>your</b> work.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The 'ole thing,' {{continued}} the expert, 'is <b>to</b> feint with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and 'it with your right.' This was excellent in theory, no doubt, but Tony felt {{that when he}} came to put it into practice Allen might have other schemes on hand and bring them off first.|$|R
6000|$|... "You came up {{the trail}} from the Double-Elm Fork," [...] he said promisingly. [...] "As you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted /jacal/ <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> under a comma mott." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are most}} curious and interesting," [...] replied the dervish. [...] "If you apply {{a little of}} it <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> eye you will behold in an instant all the treasures hidden {{in the bowels of}} the earth.

6000|$|... "Put {{it down in}} my note-book," [...] Ney said {{to one of his}} staff. [...] "Good-night, comrades, {{you have}} done me good.

5000|$|For three players. Two {{things have}} to be {{concerned}} about: you must kill the one that is on your right (that player after your turn) and also try to save <b>to</b> one on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> (the player before your turn). If a player whose position is immediately before you dies, you also lose the game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there, you see, that's what it is. I know old George Jenkins. He {{used to be}} {{a pretty}} good boxer in his time, but there! boxing's a thing, like {{everything}} else, that moves with the times. We used to go about in iron trucks. Now we go in motor-cars. Just the same with boxing. What you're learning now is the sort of boxing that wins championship fights nowadays. Old George, well, he teaches you how <b>to</b> put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> out, but, my Golly, he doesn't know any tricks. He hasn't studied it same as I have. It's the ring-craft that wins battles. Now sir, if you're ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|D'Alcacer {{brought a}} stool {{close to the}} long chair {{and sat down on}} it. [...] "Oh, yes, the {{possible}} hour of fate," [...] he said. [...] "I have a request to make, Mrs. Travers. I don't ask you to betray anything. What would be the good? The issue when it comes will be plain enough. But I should like to get a warning, just something that would give me time to pull myself together, to compose myself as it were. I want you to promise me that if the balance tips against us you will give me a sign. You could, for instance, seize the opportunity when I am looking at you <b>to</b> put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>to</b> <b>your</b> forehead like this. It is a gesture that I have never seen you make, and so. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you row {{for about}} half an hour without exerting yourself--and I can trust you not to do that--and then look <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> you'll see a certain hostelry, if it hasn't moved since I was last there. It's called the 'Blue Boar'. We will have tea there, and then I'll pull gently back, and that will end the programme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, lady, I escaped, but I {{crossed the}} plain far <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> for it seemed better {{that we should}} not be seen {{travelling}} together from the mountain. Now let us eat who have eaten little for so many days, lacking water to wash down the food," [...] and from the large skin wallet which he bore Zinti drew out dried flesh and roasted corn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{might have}} thought {{that both of them}} were meant for you, both are still so like you. Indeed,' said Clennam, glancing from the fair {{original}} to the picture and back, 'I cannot even now say which is not your portrait.' 'D'ye hear that, Mother?' cried Mr Meagles to his wife, who had followed her daughter. 'It's always the same, Clennam; nobody can decide. The child <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> is Pet.' ...|$|E
60|$|Simla Club dining-room is built, as all {{the world}} knows, in two sections, with an arch-arrangement {{dividing}} them. Come in, turn <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own <b>left,</b> take the table under the window, and you cannot see any one who has come in, turning to the right, and taken a table {{on the right side}} of the arch. Curiously enough, every word that you say can be heard, not only by the other diner, but by the servants beyond the screen through which they bring dinner. This is worth knowing: an echoing-room is a trap to be forewarned against.|$|R
50|$|Keeping {{the point}} of the cane to the front, turn you upper body to the left {{slightly}} as you draw back your right hand (palm facing up i.e. towards you) and arm across your chest. Transfer <b>your</b> weight slightly <b>to</b> <b>your</b> back (<b>left)</b> foot and raise your front heel slightly as you do so. Your hand should pass the line of your spine (if viewed from the side). Now turn your hand over (anti-clockwise), in order to flip {{the point of}} your cane out behind you, with your hand and forearm over <b>your</b> <b>left</b> shoulder, and extend the cane out to the rear as far as possible. Next, bring your arm and the cane around from the rear to the front, along a horizontal line. If the target is the head, remain upright as you deliver your hit. Your arm should remain straight throughout the execution of the strike as the point travels through an 180 degrees arc from the rear to the front.|$|R
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch <b>to</b> see if <b>your</b> <b>left</b> heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier <b>to</b> watch <b>your</b> heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul {{does not}} look upon me as infallible," [...] she protested. [...] "Besides, there are other considerations. And now, please, we will talk of the tennis. I {{do not know whether}} it is my fancy, but that man there <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> in grey, {{seems to me to be}} taking an {{interest}} in our conversation. He cannot possibly overhear, and he has not glanced once in our direction, yet I have an instinct for these things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle is {{very good}} to me," [...] Joan said. [...] "I sent {{and asked him to}} come and persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife, who is not well. It is arranged, and we go at dawn to-morrow. From his house I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs, and wait and strive until my prayer is granted. Who were the two cavaliers who sat <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> at the governor's table that day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Worthy Master Timewell, the Mayor of this fair town of Taunton, who {{has been}} a tower of {{strength}} to the faithful during these long and spirit-trying times, is about to inspect us when the others shall have assembled. Captains, to your companies then! Close up there on the musqueteers, with three paces between each line. Scythesmen, take ground <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>left.</b> Let the under-officers stand on the flanks and rear. So!

40|$|In July 1891, Rev. Henry Cooke {{recorded}} that on {{two occasions}} "we all took dinner at Wigands" [a restaurant near the docks at Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island]. " The one great peculiarity of Wigands is that they insist upon putting the dessert on the table before, long before, you are through {{with the rest of}} your dinner and you have to hold on <b>to</b> it with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand while you eat with your right, for fear an excusionist [a visitor on a day's outing] empty [...] . and hungry might get hold of it. ...|$|R
40|$|I’m {{sitting here}} slowly {{breathing}} next <b>to</b> <b>your</b> shirt you <b>left</b> in my bed.

I held the door, she held my hand; it was all picturesque and typical. Maybe eventually I’ll stop mistaking your face for strangers in the streets...|$|R

"Let us incline <b>to</b> the <b>left,</b> <b>your</b> honour," [...] said Joyce, respectfully; [...] "there is a naked rock hereabouts, that {{completely}} overlooks the clearing, {{and where we}} can get even a peep at the Hut. I have often sat on it, when out with the gun, and wearied; for the next thing to being at home, is to see home." ...|$|R
