Stephen Cook, writing for Allmusic, stated: [...] "Taking in such ambient milestones as Brian Eno's Apollo recording, Stars of the Lid's Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie fashion eight floating gems with <b>touches</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> noise and movie soundtrack atmospherics. No drums or clanging guitars here, just darkish, elegiac slabs of ethereal sound taking up 12 to 18 {{minutes at a}} pop. The overall effect is both calming and provocative." ...|$|R
