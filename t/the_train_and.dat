5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996.

30|$|In {{the first}} experiment, Exp. 1, native Arabic {{speakers}} {{are involved in}} both <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> testing. The WestPoint corpus is divided {{in such a way}} that 61 % of the corpus is used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> 39 % for the test regardless of either gender or scripts. In the second experiment, Exp. 2, native speakers are used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> only nonnative speakers are involved in the test phase. Then, <b>the</b> <b>training</b> uses 85 % of the corpus (native speakers), while 15 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers is used for the test. In Exp. 3, all nonnative Arabic speakers were used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> all Arabic native speakers for the test. In the fourth experiment, Exp. 4, only nonnative Arabic speakers were used in both <b>training</b> <b>and</b> testing systems. <b>The</b> nonnative speakers' part of the corpus is divided to obtain 67 % for <b>the</b> <b>training,</b> <b>and</b> 33 % for the test. In the fifth experiment, Exp. 5, both native and nonnative Arabic utterances are pooled to constitute <b>the</b> <b>training</b> data (69 % of the corpus) and testing data (31 % of the corpus). Experiments Exp. 6 to Exp. 9 are set up by varying the gender of <b>the</b> speakers in <b>training</b> <b>and</b> testing data. In Exp. 6, native male speakers are used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> only nonnative male speakers are involved in the test. Thus <b>the</b> <b>training</b> uses 82 % of the corpus (male speakers only), while 18 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers is used for the test. In Exp. 7, native female speakers are used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> only nonnative female speakers are involved in the test. Hence <b>the</b> <b>training</b> uses 90 % of the corpus (female speakers only), while 10 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers is used for the test. In Exp. 8, nonnative male speakers are used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> only native male speakers are involved in the test. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>training</b> uses 18 % of the corpus (male speakers), while 82 % of the corpus composed of native male speakers is used for the test. Finally, in Exp. 9, nonnative female speakers are used for <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> only native female speakers are involved in the test. Thus <b>the</b> <b>training</b> uses 10 % of the corpus (female speakers), while 90 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers is used for the test. The bigram language model was always derived from the total of prompts provided by WestPoint. This means that we use the same language model for all experiments.|$|R

The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter.
