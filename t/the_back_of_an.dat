5|$|Alexis Helmer, a close friend, {{was killed}} during the battle on May 2. McCrae {{performed}} the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves {{of those who died}} at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside Ypres. This location is today known as the John McCrae Memorial Site.|$|E
5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings {{have been described as}} something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
5|$|The T30 HMC was {{originally}} conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the Armored Force's requirement for an assault gun to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units. The Ordnance Department design {{was based on}} the M3 Half-track in order that it could be brought into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> M3 Half-track.|$|E

5|$|The gastral {{segments}} {{have small}} constrictions {{between the first}} and second segments. The stinger is long but largely internalized, and it is also stout and slightly upcurved apically. The external parts are enclosed by the gonostyli, and the sting bulb is large. The integument (a protective outer layer) is rugose throughout except on the legs and gaster. The dorsofrontal area of the head (<b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insect), and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and petiole are covered by erect hairs, and slightly longer hairs are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose (bristles) with longer decumbent hairs (meaning that these hairs are lying down).|$|E
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E

5|$|When {{rebel forces}} entered the palace, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept {{in communication with}} the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing {{that they were still}} in the palace. The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.|$|E
5|$|A 2–1 away defeat to Barrow saw {{the team}} {{knocked out of}} the FA Trophy in the quarter-final, Pacquette scoring for York. York {{suffered}} a second straight league defeat after being beaten 2–1 away by Forest Green Rovers, in which Mackin scored after his shot hit <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opposition player. Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference resulted in York having the three points gained against them from a 3–2 victory expunged, meaning the team moved down to sixth in the table. York were defeated 2–1 at home by Salisbury, after Sangaré had put the team in the lead. Chesterfield midfielder Paul Harsley joined on loan {{until the end of}} the season, and made his debut in a 0–0 draw away to Altrincham, a result that ended a run of three consecutive defeats. York's first victory in six league matches was a 1–0 away win over Mansfield, Pitt scoring his first goal for the club. McWilliams was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for one month. A second successive victory came after Barrett scored the only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Kidderminster. Graham opened the scoring in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth, who equalised through former York player Chris Smith. A 4–0 victory away to Grays saw Brodie score for the first time since January 2010 with two goals; Harsley and Barrett also scored.|$|E

25|$|He did {{not play}} again after that year and instead turned his {{attention}} to cricket, appearing in his first and only first-class cricket match in the 1926/27 summer. The match, a Sheffield Shield encounter against New South Wales, took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground. New South Wales batted first and amassed 469, on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten 217 by Alan Kippax. Salvana did not bowl but contributed with a catch to dismiss Test player Johnny Taylor. A right-handed batsman, Salvana opened the batting in each of Victoria's innings and made scores of six and a duck. In the second innings he was dismissed by Charlie Macartney, an Australian representative.|$|E
25|$|In 1584 Verdonck {{returned}} to Spain, once again {{singing in the}} choir of Philip II, staying there until 1598 or 1599, after which he again {{returned to}} Antwerp. Also in 1599 he participated in the elaborate entry procession of the newly married Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella into Antwerp, writing a motet (Prome, novas) for the occasion: it was performed by a six-member boys' choir mounted on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elephant, which rode along with the Archduke and Archduchess (accounts differ {{as to whether it}} was a real or artificial animal). It is the only known motet composed for performance on an elephant.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine campaigned {{briefly as}} a {{volunteer}} in the October 1951 General Election before going up to Pembroke College, Oxford, where, in frustration at his inability to be elected to the committee of the Oxford University Conservative Association, he founded the breakaway Blue Ribbon Club. Julian Critchley recounted a story from his student days of how he plotted his future on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> envelope, a future that would culminate as Prime Minister in the 1990s. A more detailed apocryphal version has him writing down: 'millionaire 25, cabinet member 35, party leader 45, prime minister 55'. He became a millionaire {{and was a member}} of the shadow cabinet from the age of 41 but did not manage to become Party Leader or Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|Off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} {{season in}} 1934-35 in the Tasmanian competition, Morrisby was somewhat surprisingly called {{up for the}} Australian team's tour on India in 1935-36, led by Frank Tarrant. He had an excellent tour, scoring 2 centuries, and 3 half-centuries, and played in all four unofficial Test matches (only first-class status) against India. His highest ever first-class score of 145 came against Patiala in Punjab. Having been set a competitive 352 to chase, Morrisby top-scored, including sharing a second-wicket partnership of 274 with New South Welshman, Wendell Bill. Including his matches for Tasmania in that year, Morrisby had the best first-class season {{of his career in}} 1935-36, scoring 811 runs at 40.55, with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1963, Minh and his co-conspirators overthrew the {{government}} in a swift coup. With only the palace guard remaining to defend Diệm {{and his younger brother}} Nhu, the generals called the palace offering Diệm exile if he surrendered. That evening, however, Diệm and his entourage escaped via an underground passage to Cha Tam Catholic Church in Cholon, where they were captured the following morning, 2 November. The brothers were assassinated together in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> M113 armoured personnel carrier with a bayonet and revolver by Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, under orders from Minh given while en route to the Vietnamese Joint General Staff headquarters. Diệm was buried in an unmarked grave in a cemetery next to the house of the US Ambassador.|$|E
25|$|Osteen {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, {{and is one of}} six {{children}} of John Osteen and Dolores ("Dodie") Pilgrim. His father, a former Southern Baptist pastor, founded Lakewood Church, of which Osteen is the current senior pastor, in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old feed store. He was educated at Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, from which he graduated in 1981, followed by Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television communications, but did not graduate and did not receive a degree from a divinity school. In 1982, he returned to Houston and founded Lakewood's television program, where he produced his father's televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack.|$|E
