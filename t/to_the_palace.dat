5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force.

The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
