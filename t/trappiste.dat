40|$|A {{monolithic}} {{active pixel}} sensor for charged particle tracking {{has been developed}} within the frame of a research and development project called <b>TRAPPISTe</b> (Tracking Particles for Physics Instrumentation in SOI Technology). <b>TRAPPISTe</b> aims to study the feasibility of developing a monolithic pixel sensor with SOI technology. TRAPPISTe- 2 is the second prototype in this series and was fabricated with an OKI 0. 20 μm fully depleted (FD-SOI) CMOS process. This device contains test transistors and amplifiers, {{as well as two}} pixel matrices with integrated 3 -transistor and amplifier readout electronics. The results presented are based on the first electrical measurements performed on the test structures and laser measurements on the pixel matrices...|$|E
40|$|A {{monolithic}} {{active pixel}} sensor for charged particle tracking was developed. This research is performed {{within the framework}} of an R&D project called <b>TRAPPISTe</b> (Tracking Particles for Physics Instrumentation in SOI Technology) whose aim is to evaluate the feasibility of developing a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) with Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology. Two chips were fabricated: TRAPPISTe- 1 and TRAPPISTe- 2. TRAPPISTe- 1 was produced at the WINFAB facility at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium, in a 2 μm fully depleted (FD-SOI) CMOS process. TRAPPISTe- 2 was fabricated with the LAPIS 0. 2 μm FD-SOI CMOS process. The electrical characterization on single transistor test structures and of the electronic readout for the <b>TRAPPISTe</b> series of monolithic pixel detectors was carried out. The behavior of the prototypes' electronics {{as a function of the}} back voltage was studied. Results showed that both readout circuits exhibited sensitivity to the back voltage. Despite this unwanted secondary effect, the responses of TRAPPISTe- 2 amplifiers can be improved by a variation in the circuit parameters. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

It has a distinct flavour and aroma, and is still manufactured in Oka, although now by a commercial company. The rights were sold in 1996 by Les Pères <b>Trappistes</b> to the Agropur cooperative. It is also manufactured in Holland, Manitoba, by Trappist Monks at the Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery, which is located 8 miles southeast of Holland.|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{particle}} detectors {{are found}} {{at the forefront of}} scientific imaging applications. From medical imaging machines that scan the human body to space telescopes observing phenomena lightyears away, silicon detectors are used in the most demanding of situations. High Energy Physics experiments, such as the ones running at CERN, use silicon pixel detectors at their core to image subatomic particles in order to probe the fundamentals of physics. Current state of the art tracker detectors are hybrid detectors which satisfy challenging resolution, material budget and radiation hardness requirements. The term hybrid refers {{to the fact that the}} sensor and readout electronics are fabricated separately and subsequently bonded together. The <b>TRAPPISTe</b> detector developed at the Université catholique de Louvain is a monolithic pixel detector developed in Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology. As a monolithic detector, the sensor and readout electronics are fabricated on the same wafer providing potential benefits of increased resolution and lower material budget compared to hybrid detectors. The first proof of concept <b>TRAPPISTe</b> devices have been built and tested. A charge sensitive amplifier has been monolithically integrated into a matrix with 150 um x 150 um pixels. The amplifiers are able to detect 1 MIP of induced charge and the matrix is able to track the position of a laser source. These first devices show the potential of using monolithic SOI detectors in high energy physics and other applications while at the same time highlighting the technical challenges to be dealt with such as the backgate effect and radiation hardness.

50|$|Conversions to Christianity {{have been}} most common in Kabylie, {{especially}} in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou. In Tizi-Ouzou, the proportion of Christians has been estimated to be between 1% and 5%. Christians have at times been subjected to religiously motivated attacks. In 1996, Pierre Claverie, bishop of Oran, was assassinated by terrorists. This murder occurred soon after that of seven monks of the <b>Trappistes</b> of Tibérine, and of six nuns. This terrorist act {{was part of a}} general trend of violence during the Algerian Civil War in the 1990s, commonly known as the Black Decade. During this time, between 100,000 and 200,000 Algerians lost their lives.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} brewing style on {{physicochemical}} indices, iso-a-acids and antioxidant contents of commercial beers were investigated. A great variability was highlighted {{for all the}} considered parameters (sugar and alcohol contents, density, pH, titratable acidity, iso-a-acids, phenolic content, antioxidant activity). The beers having the highest iso-a-acids contents were Guinness Special Export Stout (which also showed the highest phenolic content), Chimay Pères <b>Trappistes</b> Triple, and Greene King IPA whereas the lowest values were detected in Cuveè De Ranke, Heineken Premium Quality Lager, and Riedenburger Brauhaus gluten free. The latter also had the lowest phenolic concentration. The antioxidant activity values strictly correlated with the total phenolic content {{but not with the}} iso-?-acid amount. The Principal Component Analysis failed in distinguishing beers based on their declared type/styles. This was a predictable result since the beer styles don’t represent a compositional classification but they are rather used to indicate commercial types. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 1826 in Rome he {{published}} Chants romains, which contained verses of an irreligious character. After his return home in 1828 {{he issued a}} number of volumes of poems and dramas, as Les <b>Trappistes</b> (Angoulême, 1828), Inspirations poétiques (Angoulême, 1833), and other poems. He accomplished much more as a polemical journalist {{in the struggle against}} the liberalism, which, after the revolution of July, directed the State during the reign of the Duke of Orléans as Louis-Philippe. Being a Vendean he was an enthusiastic adherent of the hereditary royal house, and zealously defended its rights in several Legitimist newspapers of which he was editor. In 1837 he went to reside in Paris in order to devote himself to historical research concerning the history of Vendée, but in 1839 he also took on the editing of L'Europe monarchique, a newspaper devoted to the interests of the Bourbons. Before this he had published two writings on Vendée: Épisodes des guerres de la Vendée (1834) and Histoire des généraux et chefs vendéens (1838). He now combined the two, making use {{of a large number of}} sources until then unknown, and issued his most important work: Histoire de la Vendée militaire (Paris, 1840-41), 4 vols; the fifth edition appeared in 1865. The work brought him repute on account of the animated descriptions, the clear arrangement of the great mass of material, and his painstaking care in the use of authorities. It is suggested, though, that he was less than scrupulous as to how he obtained his materials.|$|R
