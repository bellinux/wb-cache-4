25|$|McGregor {{read books}} about crack and heroin {{to prepare for}} the role. He also went to Glasgow and met people from the Calton Athletic Recovery Group, an {{organisation}} of recovering heroin addicts. He was taught how <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> heroin with a spoon using glucose powder. McGregor considered injecting heroin to better understand the character, but eventually decided against it.|$|E
25|$|The seafood safari episode {{saw many}} firsts for the Great BBQ Challenge. The first dessert to be cooked {{entirely on the}} BBQ, the first entree and the first tears of the series. Restaurateur Fenton shocked the judges with his {{signature}} dish, the great Aussie pavlova with boozy summer fruits. Darwin cook Lisette served up antipasto and Perth IT professional Laz had all the right flavours with his stir fry vegetables and lamb chops. During the screen test Fenton's explosive nature impressed Mark and Julia while Laz came out on top with his clear delivery and knowledge base. The final challenge was <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> a seafood feast. Laz's cook in the bag technique came under criticism from Ben as he didn't clean the flat plate between courses and mixed his meal with the charred remains of the previous dish. Fenton's Moreton Bay bugs prepared with Asian flavours, secured the win from the judges and moved him to tears and into the semi finals.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for La Bella Mafia {{began in the}} spring of 2002. In April 2002, Lil' Kim stated in an interview that she had begun working with Dr. Dre in the recording studio. She told MTV, [...] "I've been talking to Dre a lot. And Dre and I are talking about possibly doing some collaborations. He's a cool cat. I love Dre. Our chemistry in the studio was just like, cool. We've been working, you know, trying <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> some things". Kim also stated that she wanted to work with Eminem, Timbaland, and The Neptunes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} Mrs. Doubtfire Robin Williams, {{disguised}} as a woman, viewed Julia Child's videos {{in order to learn}} how <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>up</b> appearances of being an excellent nanny.|$|R

60|$|Besides this barley there were, as above, {{twenty or}} thirty stalks of rice, which I {{preserved}} with the same care, and whose use was {{of the same kind}} or to the same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> it <b>up</b> without baking, though I did that also after some time. But to return to my journal.|$|R
500|$|Many of Cibber's plays, listed below, were hastily cobbled {{together}} from borrowings. Alexander Pope said Cibber's drastic adaptations and patchwork plays {{were stolen from}} [...] "crucified Molière" [...] and [...] "hapless Shakespeare". The Double Gallant (1707) was constructed from Burnaby's The Reformed Wife and The Lady's Visiting Day, and Centlivre's Love at a Venture. In the words of Leonard R. N. Ashley, Cibber took [...] "what he could use from these old failures" [...] <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> [...] "a palatable hash out of unpromising leftovers". The Comical Lovers (1707) was based on Dryden's Marriage à la Mode. The Rival Fools (1709) was based on Fletcher's Wit at Several Weapons. He rewrote Corneille's Le Cid with a happy ending as Ximena in 1712. The Provoked Husband (1728) was an unfinished fragment by John Vanbrugh that Cibber reworked and completed to great commercial success.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{nobody else}} will either. It's dashed good of you, Freddie, <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> a yarn {{like that to}} try and make things look better for the blighter, but it won't work. Such a damn silly story, too!" [...] said Algy with some indignation.|$|E
5000|$|If {{you look}} at all of the {{complicated}} ideas that they have developed in an infinitesimal amount of time, if you compare to any other of the sciences how long it takes to get one idea after the other, if you consider all the structures and inventions and complicated things, the ids and the egos, the tensions and the forces, and the pushes and the pulls, I tell you they can't all be there. It's too much for one brain or a few brains <b>to</b> have <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> in such a short time.|$|R
50|$|The bird {{depicted}} on the squadron badge is a falcon, with the snake serving two purposes, one the then (First World War) obvious anti-Central Powers symbolism, {{the second to}} circumvent the rules about squadron badges featuring a squadron's number. The cunningly coiled snake (rumoured <b>to</b> have been <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> by No. 6 Squadron members Louis Strange and Lanoe Hawker) neatly sidestepped the regulations.|$|R
50|$|Gordo Sheckberry - a more roleplay focused {{player who}} is oddly obsessed with playing female characters, most notably female fairies who are {{dramatically}} underpowered {{compared to the}} other characters in the campaign. Gordo is wheelchair-bound and living on full lifetime disability, but considers this a bonus as it enables him to game almost daily with different groups. He is easily recognized by his Coke-bottle glasses and bad toupee. Gordo has a degree in Chemical Engineering, and is rumored <b>to</b> have <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> the batch of C-4 used in an attempt to breach the steam tunnels (the incident that gave Nitro his nickname).|$|R

He is a rascal----" ...|$|E
6000|$|He.--But {{it is not}} for {{speaking}} the truth--on the contrary, it is [...] for skilful lying that I covet your gift. If I knew how to write, [...] <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> a book, to turn a dedicatory epistle, to intoxicate a [...] fool as to his own merits, to insinuate myself into the good graces [...] of women! ...|$|E

5000|$|Some centrally-acting antidiarrheals, such as {{diphenoxylate}} (Lomotil) when {{mixed with}} atropine (to make it unpleasant for people <b>to</b> grind <b>up,</b> <b>cook,</b> and inject). Difenoxin with atropine (Motofen) {{has been moved}} to Schedule IV. Without atropine, these drugs are in Schedule II.|$|R

6000|$|Zuleika {{laughed again}} constrainedly, {{but in a}} way that might have {{suggested}} that this dreadful contingency was still one {{that it was possible to}} contemplate without entire consternation. As she moved slowly towards the door she stopped, with her hand on the lock, and said tentatively: [...] "I reckon you won't be wantin' any supper before you go? You're almost sure to be offered suthin' up at Horseley's, while if I have <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> you <b>up</b> suthin' now and still have the men's regular supper to get at seven, it makes all the expense of an extra meal." ...|$|R
6000|$|I determined, therefore, {{to change}} my lodgings, drop my correspondence, and {{disappear}} altogether from the view of my village admirers. Besides, I was anxious to make one more poetic attempt. I {{was by no means}} disheartened by the failure of my first. My poem was evidently too didactic. The public was wise enough. It no longer read for instruction. [...] "They want horrors, do they?" [...] said I, [...] "I'faith, then they shall have enough of them." [...] So I looked out for some quiet retired place, where I might be out of reach of my friends, and have leisure <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> some delectable dish of poetical [...] "hell-broth." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} to bandy words with the fellow, as I understood, {{even though my}} anger {{was so great that}} it would have soothed me {{somewhat}} to give him a plain statement of the position he occupied in Virginia; but I held my peace as I threw myself down by the side of little Frenchie, counting that the lad would chide me for having had speech with Abel Hunt. Instead of so doing he remained silent, his head pillowed on his arm as he looked across the river toward the twinkling lights on Gloucester Point where a portion of Lord Cornwallis's army was encamped, and straightway there came into my mind the thought that the dear lad was striving <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> some plan which might work to our advantage.|$|E
6000|$|No one can {{be alone}} {{at home or in}} a quite new place. Memory and you must go hand in hand with (at least) decent weather if you wish <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> a proper dish of solitude. It is in these little flights of mine that I get more {{pleasure}} than in anything else. [...] Now, at present, I am supremely uneasy and restless - almost to the extent of pain; but O! how I enjoy it, and how I SHALL enjoy it afterwards (please God), if I get years enough allotted to me for the thing to ripen in. When I am a very old and very respectable citizen with white hair and bland manners and a gold watch, I shall hear three crows cawing in my heart, as I heard them this morning: [...] I vote for old age and eighty years of retrospect. Yet, after all, I dare say, a short shrift and a nice green grave are about as desirable.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{low levels}} of {{domestic}} horticulture, fresh tropical fruits feature less highly in New Caledonian cuisine than in other Pacific nations, instead relying on rice, fish and root vegetables such as taro. One way this is frequently prepared is in a buried-oven-style feast, known as Bougna. Wrapped in banana leaves, the fish, taro, banana and other seafood are buried with hot rocks <b>to</b> <b>cook,</b> then dug <b>up</b> and eaten.|$|R
6000|$|... "' I'll go {{and have}} a look at the place tomorrow,' I said; 'there is no parade, and I can start early. You may as well tell the mess <b>cook</b> <b>to</b> put <b>up</b> a basket with some tiffin and a bottle of claret, and get a boy to carry it over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's better," [...] {{he said as}} he {{eyed her}} critically. [...] "Now you're talkin'! I'd do a little reading of the {{newspaper}} myself, if I was. you.

Stand up to 'em! Doggone me if I'd paddle round that hot cornfield with a mess o' Dutchmen-it ain't decent!" ...|$|R
60|$|With Circle City in {{prospect}} and {{the last}} ice crumbling under his runners, Montana Kid {{took advantage of the}} lengthening days and travelled his dogs late and early. Further, he had but little doubt that the owner of the dogs in question had taken his trail, and he wished to make American territory before the river broke. But by the afternoon of the third day it became evident that he had lost in his race with spring. The Yukon was growling and straining at its fetters. Long detours became necessary, for the trail had begun to fall through into the swift current beneath, while the ice, in constant unrest, was thundering apart in great gaping fissures. Through these and through countless airholes, the water began to sweep {{across the surface of the}} ice, and by the time he pulled into a woodchopper's cabin on the point of an island, the dogs were being rushed off their feet and were swimming more often than not. He was greeted sourly by the two residents, but he unharnessed and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In short, {{when the}} case did come to trial, it [...] "blew up," [...] {{as one of our}} ward leaders {{dynamically}} expressed it. Several important witnesses were mysteriously lacking, and two or three school-teachers had suddenly decided--to take a trip to Europe. The district attorney was ill, and assigned the prosecution to a mild assistant; while a sceptical jury--composed largely of gentlemen who had the business interests of the community, and of themselves, at heart returned a verdict of [...] "not guilty." [...] This was the signal for severely dignified editorials in Mr. Tallant's and other conservative newspapers, hinting that it might be well in the future for all well-meaning but misguided reformers to think twice before subjecting the city to the cost of such trials, and uselessly attempting to inflame public opinion and upset legitimate business. The Era expressed the opinion that no city in the United States was [...] "more efficiently and economically governed than our own." [...] "Irregularities" [...] might well occur in every large organization; and it would better have become Mr. Greenhalge if, instead of hiring an unknown lawyer thirsting for notoriety <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> charges, he had called the attention of the proper officials to the matter, etc., etc. The Pilot alone, which relied on sensation for its circulation, kept hammering away for a time with veiled accusations. But our citizens had become weary....|$|E

Briscoe was arrested on 6 October 2012. She was later convicted, sentenced to 16 months in prison and stripped of her barrister role. Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury that Briscoe and Pryce had [...] "started it together by approaching a man called Andrew Alderson (a journalist working for the Mail on Sunday)", falsely claiming that one of Huhne's aides, Jo White, took points for him in 2003. Edis stated that Briscoe was a neighbour and friend of Pryce and that the [...] "two of them appear <b>to</b> have <b>cooked</b> <b>up</b> a plan" [...] to bring about Huhne's downfall.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990 reunion TV movie Return to Green Acres, {{made and}} set {{two decades after}} the series, Oliver and Lisa have moved back to New York but are miserable there.

It will be a strange sort of book, tho', I fear; blubber is blubber you know; tho' you may get oil out of it, the poetry runs as hard as sap from a frozen maple tree; — & <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> the thing <b>up,</b> one must needs throw in a little fancy, which from {{the nature of the}} thing, must be ungainly as the gambols of the whales themselves. Yet I mean to give the truth of the thing, spite of this.|$|R
50|$|Ringed spaces {{appear in}} {{analysis}} {{as well as}} complex algebraic geometry and scheme theory of algebraic geometry.

5000|$|But in {{the early}} 21st century, wild {{squirrel}} has become a more popular meat <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> with, showing <b>up</b> in restaurants and shops more often in Britain as a fashionable alternative meat. [...] Specifically, UK citizens are cooking with the invasive gray squirrel, which is being praised for its low fat content {{and the fact that}} it comes from free range sources. Additionally, the novelty of a meat considered unusual or special has added to the spread of squirrel consumption. Due to the difficulty of a clean kill and other factors, the majority of squirrel eaten in the UK is acquired from professional hunters, trappers, and gamekeepers.|$|R
5000|$|Elimination Challenge #2: The {{remaining}} contestants and Joe Bastianich would blind {{taste test}} dishes {{to determine which}} home cook would rejoin them.
