These three components effectively form a sandwich with the ribbon in the middle.A thermally compliant print head, in combination with the electrical properties of the ribbon and the correct rheological properties of the ribbon ink are all essential in producing a high quality printed image.|$|R

40|$|Dot gain is {{different}} when dots are printed alone, printed in superposition with one ink or printed in superposition with two inks. In addition, the dot gain may also differ {{depending on which}} solid ink the considered halftone layer is superposed. In a previous research project, we developed a model for computing the effective surface coverage of a dot according to its superposition conditions. In the present contribution, we improve the Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer model by integrating into it our effective dot surface coverage computation model. Calibration of the reproduction curves mapping nominal to effective surface coverages in every superposition condition is carried out by fitting effective dot surfaces which minimize the sum of square differences between the measured reflection density spectra and reflection density spectra predicted according to the Yule-Nielsen modified Neugebauer model. In order to predict the reflection spectrum of a patch, its known nominal surface coverage values are converted into effective coverage values by weighting the contributions from different reproduction curves according to the weights of the contributing superposition conditions. We analyze the colorimetric prediction improvement brought by our extended dot surface coverage model for clustered-dot offset <b>prints,</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>prints</b> and ink-jet prints.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} printing accuracies {{and the possibility}} of printing several droplets at the same pixel location, there is a renewed interest in dot-on-dot printing models. In the present contribution, we improve a dot-on-dot spectral prediction model relying on the Yule-Nielsen modified Spectral Neugebauer model by taking into account ink spreading in all ink superposition conditions. Since ink spreading is different when ink dots are printed alone, printed in superposition with one ink or printed in superposition with two inks, we create for each superposition condition an ink spreading function mapping nominal to effective dot surface coverages. When predicting the reflection spectrum of a dot-on-dot halftone patch, its known nominal surface coverage values are converted into effective coverage values by weighting the contributions from different ink spreading functions according to the corresponding ratio of colorant surface coverages. We analyze the colorimetric prediction improvement brought by our ink spreading model for dot-on-dot <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>prints</b> and for ink-jet prints. Accounting for ink spreading according to different ink superposition conditions considerably improves the prediction accuracy. In the case of ink jet prints at 120 lpi, the mean ΔE 94 difference between predictions and measurements is reduced from 4. 54 to 1. 55 (accuracy improvement factor: 3). Due to the slight misregistration between the ink layers, spectral predictions accounting for ink spreading in the case of dot-on-dot screens are less accurate than corresponding predictions for classical mutually rotated screens...|$|R

40|$|The <b>thermal</b> {{deposition}} and <b>transfer</b> <b>Printing</b> method {{had been}} used to produce pentacene thin-films on SiO 2 /Si and plastic substrates (PMMA and PVP), respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns of pentacene thin films showed reflections associated with highly ordered polycrystalline films and a coexistence of two polymorph phases classified by their d-spacing, d(001) : 14. 4 and 15. 4 A. The dependence of the c-axis correlation length and the phase fraction on the film thickness and printing temperature were measured. A transition from the 15. 4 A phase towards 14. 4 A phase was also observed with increasing film thickness. An increase in the c-axis correlation length of approximately 12 % ~ 16 % was observed for Pn films <b>transfer</b> <b>printed</b> onto a PMMA coated PET substrate at 100 ~ 120 C as compared to as-grown Pn films on SiO 2 /Si substrates. The <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method is shown to be an attractive for the fabrication of pentacene thin-film transistors on flexible substrates partly because of the resulting improvement in the quality of the pentacene film.

40|$|The present paper {{explains}} {{the stages of}} clothing style improvement by using computer graphics programs. Ovidiu Stan, {{a student in the}} Department of Textiles and Leatherworking and Industrial Management, under our guidance, did research at the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania in Cluj Napoca, where he selected a folk pattern specific to Transylvania area, reinterpreted it and digitized it in the vector graphics program CorelDRAW. This program allows the shape and size of drawings to be modified, and offers a vast chromatic palette which allows us to style the drawings. The pattern was printed on the T-shirt with an Azon Tex Pro printer, which can replace screen-printing or <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer.</b> The <b>printing</b> system is high-speed and very high quality, and the printed patterns can be unique, highly resistent to wear and washing. After the digitization stage, the next stage was to embroider the pattern on the T-shirt with the Happy embroidery machine. The embroidered pattern was designed by using the BERNINA Embroidery Software Designer Plus software. This embroidery software offers the freedom to design and edit elegant monograms, and complete freedom of creative design.

Well-defined ferroelectric beta crystalline domains were developed with THDA up to approximately 50 wt %, with respect to polymer concentration; resulting in characteristic ferroelectric hysteresis polarization-voltage loops in metal/cross-linked ferroelectric layer/metal capacitors with remnant polarization of approximately 4 mu C/cm(2).

A low-voltage operating FeFET was realized with a networked PVDF-TrFE film, which had significantly reduced gate leakage current between the drain and gate electrodes. A solution-processed single crystalline tri-isopropylsilylethynyl pentacene FeFET with a chemically cross-linked PVDF-TrFE film showed reliable I-V hysteresis with source-drain ON/OFF current bistablility of 1 x 10 (3) at a sweeping gate voltage of +/- 20 V.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} low-cost antennas and communication systems to support the burgeoning demand for bandwidth {{in the next generation}} wireless communications and networks (5 G) and/or Internet of Things (IoT). The work was divided into three different fields all aimed at low-cost solutions of enabling next generation networks (5 G) and IoT. The first part of the study involves study of low-cost fabrication of antennas and radio frequency (RF) guided wave structures up to 10 GHz using the <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> (TTP) technique on renewable, light weight, flexible and low-cost substrates. The <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method for electronics was characterised from DC to 10 GHz and benchmarked for performance against inkjet printing technique which is an established technique for printed electronics. TTP achieved similar or better read range to inkjet printed radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas that were used in this study. Applications of the TTP method in IoT taking advantage of its speed and low cost were demonstrated by; producing on-demand antennas and/or rapid prototyping electronic designs, using off the shelf components to build a frequency agile antenna, and an ultra wideband antenna (UWB) for low power short range communications. The second part involves design and optimisation of a multi-port driven (MPD) slot-ring antenna for purposes of integration with resonant tunnelling diode (RTD) oscillators for millimetre-wave communications. The optimised structure managed airside radiation without the use of bulky lenses and achieved directivity of 10. 8 dBi. The concept of the slot-ring with a backing ground plane was experimentally verified by a fabricated antenna for 5 GHz operation showing the expected performance. The third part is an experimental study of modulating RTD oscillators to deter- mine and improve achievable modulation bandwidth to meet 5 G demands. Wireless transceiver systems at 28 - 40 GHz and 240 GHz were build using combinations of horn antennas, quasi-optical Schottky barrier diode detectors and some off-line signal processing. The modulation bandwidth of the oscillators were found to be limited to 300 Mbps and 16 Mbps for the 28 - 40 GHz oscillators and 220 - 300 GHz oscillators respectively due to oscillators being optimised for high power output instead of high modulation rates. Recommendations are made to improve the modulation datarate of these oscillators {{in order to meet the}} 5 G datarate targets...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{companies}} popularly {{used the}} powder coating, classing, and <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> (TTP) technique to avoid oxidation on the metallic surface and stiffened speaker diaphragm. This study developed a TTP technique to fabricate a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stiffened speaker diaphragm for thin panel speaker. The self-developed TTP stiffening technique {{did not require}} a high curing temperature that decreased the mechanical property of CNTs. In addition to increasing the stiffness of diaphragm substrate, this technique alleviated the middle and high frequency attenuation associated with the smoothing sound pressure curve of thin panel speaker. The advantage of TTP technique is less harmful to the ecology, but it causes thermal residual stresses and some unstable connections between printed plates. Thus, this study used the numerical analysis software (ANSYS) to analyze the stress and thermal of work piece which have not delaminated problems in transfer interface. The Taguchi quality engineering method was applied to identify the optimal manufacturing parameters. Finally, the optimal manufacturing parameters were employed to fabricate a CNT-based diaphragm, which was then assembled onto a speaker. The result indicated that the CNT-based diaphragm improved the sound pressure curve smoothness of the speaker, which produced a minimum high frequency dip difference (ΔdB) value...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{compare the}} maximum read range of passive ultra-high-frequency {{radio-frequency}} identification tags {{that have been}} produced using different metal printing techniques, specifically inkjet printing and <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> (TTP). They used the same substrate (THERMLfilm), antenna designs and electronic circuitry in their comparison so as to isolate {{the effect of the}} metal printing. Owing to the high metal conductivity, the thermal transfer printed tags printed with copper (Cu) film performed as well or better than the inkjet printed tags printed with silver ink, even when they changed the inkjet printed tags to a Kapton substrate that is better suited to inkjet printing. The aluminium (Al) thermal transfer printed tags had up to 33 % less read range than Cu thermal transfer printed tags. TTP needs no sintering, and provides an attractive alternative low-cost fabrication method. Characterisation of the printed traces by both methods reveals that the printing techniques achieve similar surface roughness. The achieved conductivities for TTP on THERMLfilm were better than for inkjet. The best measured read range for TTP was 10. 6 m. Across the different tag designs, the measured read ranges were 15 - 60 % (1 - 10 %) better for thermal printing, compared with inkjet printing on THERMLfilm (Kapton) ...|$|E
40|$|Adoption of Lab-on-Chip technology, which {{combines}} microfluidics with laboratory processes, is steadily increasing within the global health diagnostics field. An {{important element of}} this technology is the sensing and measurement capabilities of associated microelectronics. This thesis presents a critical analysis {{of the use of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> techniques for the manufacture of microscale electrical conductors used for biochemical assays- in this instance, cell lysate spectroscopy. This process affords advantages over traditional techniques such as chemical vapor deposition because of its compatibility with a variety of materials and ability to produce durable electrodes that can perform in the harsh environments that characterize many targeted areas where adequate access to laboratory diagnostic equipment is severely limited. Commercialization of the process to meet global demand is contingent upon the development of this process at its more rudimentary stages. This study attempts to validate the exponential scaling of this process, including qualification of manufacturing setup, optimization of operational parameters, and detailed analysis of full production runs. The maximization of sensitivity while simultaneously minimizing variation in electrode production presented the primary challenges of this work. It is concluded that a careful balance of process parameters can produce high quality, identical electrodes consistently at the thousands-level production throughput. A variation of only 2. 2 % in electrode sensitivity revealed that with the determined optimal process settings and in-line quality control, the success even further production scaling to better meet market demand is feasible. by Nikhil Jain.

It enables {{the combination of the}} current low-cost and well-established standard silicon process with high performance of III-V compound semiconductor to overcome the limitations of silicon devices, resulting in low-cost fabrication of high-performance devices. This process can be applied to not only III-V compound semiconductor technology but also low-dimensional materials (i. e. graphene and nanowires). In addition, it guarantees the freedom of choice of materials and substrates. Thus, combination and stacking process of various nanomaterials can be potentially employed by <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> for the fabrication of diverse hetero-structured optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> of inorganic semiconductor onto flexible substrate enables to achieve high-performance flexible electronic system. As a result, the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> has been actively studied in various research fields. In this thesis, we introduce the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Firstly, Chapter 1 introduces the historical background and the necessity of the <b>transfer</b> <b>printing,</b> the mechanism of the various <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> methods, and its applications. In Chapter 2, we introduce the dry <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method of InAs high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on silicon substrate for the silicon-based high-performance electronic device. In Chapter 3, we introduce the broadband and high-photoresponsivity photodiode through hetero-integration of III-V compound semiconductors on Si substrates with high-quality interface. In Chapter 4, we show the adhesive layer-assisted <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> method and the wrinkling process of the III-V compound semiconductor nanomembranes by using the vacuum-induced stress control of nanomembranes on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microwell arrays. In this method, the size, direction, and location of wrinkle arrays can be easily controlled by changing the shape and location of the microwell arrays and the modulus of soft substrates. Finally, we introduce nanosheet-on-one-dimensional heterojunction photodiode by using wet <b>transfer</b> <b>printing</b> process in Chapter 5. The device shows high rectification ratio, very low dark current, and the high On/Off current ratio at room temperature under the light illumination.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research involved determining the processes that occur during dye diffusion <b>thermal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>printing.</b> Dye diffusion printing is a novel method of printing photo quality graphics from a personal computer. The process involves two polymer films coming into contact, one containing a dye, and the diffusion of the dye from this donor sheet onto the receiving sheet using heating elements to drive the diffusion process. In this high temperature, high pressure, and short time scale regime undesirable adhesion between the two polymer sheets is observed. It is this adhesion and its mechanisms that were investigated. Several types of homopolymers were used in. an attempt to obtain information on the processes involved in the adhesion of the two films during the printing stage. Initially dyes were absent from the polymer films to examine the polymer adhesion alone. It was hoped that the principal factors involved in the unusual joint forming conditions could be explained. The unusual conditions are high heat (250 °C) and short time span (10 - 15 milliseconds). Polystyrene, poly (methyl methacrylate) and poly (vinyl acetate) were chosen {{to determine the effect}} of Glass Transition Temperature (T g), surface energies and molecular weight on the polymer adhesion. Initial results showed that the adhesion was a complex system. but {{it became clear that the}} t g of the polymers and the presence of small molecules and contaminants· were very important. Work with commercial polymers was undertaken to transfer the knowledge gained from the homopolymers to the more complicated commercial systems using poly (vinyl. chloride) and poly (vinyl butyral). To expand the understanding of the results small molecules and dyes were added to these commercial polymers to examine their effects. The surface of the samples were analysed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). This was used to determine if there was any migration of the small molecules to the surface of the polymer films. It was also useful in indicating the location of the dyes and how much penetration into the polymers is achieved by them. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was implemented to analyse the surface morphology and gave an insight into the mechanism of the small molecule migration. The conclusions drawn were that the presence of small molecules had significant affect on the adhesion of the polymers. Compatible small molecules would act as plasticisers and lower the T g of the polymers giving rise to higher adhesion. Small molecules that were incompatible were found to migrate to the surface in large quantities and would act as weak boundary layers, significantly reducing the adhesion. Work in this area has shown that an autolayering mechanism is occurring that may be useful in producing a release mechanism for the commercial products...|$|E
