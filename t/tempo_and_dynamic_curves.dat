40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis {{presents}} computational {{methods for}} the quantitative description {{and analysis of}} expressive strategies in violin performances, and applies these methods to eleven commercially available audio recordings of the Andante movement from Bach's Sonata No. 2 for solo violin. First, we develop a methodology for the extraction of beat-level <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> data from audio recordings: tempo is extracted manually, while dynamics are obtained using a psychoacoustic loudness model and a perceptually optimized smoothing algorithm.; Next, we analyze <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> means <b>and</b> ranges over musical segments of differing scales to identify trends in expressive strategies. We then propose the Local Maximum Phrase Detection method, which quantifies a performer's interpretation of phrase structure by associating each interpreted phrase with a local maximum in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>curve.</b> Throughout, we compare individual expressive and grouping strategies, and examine the similarities <b>and</b> differences between <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> variations...|$|R

To ensure the stable and reliable operation of hydropower stations, the effect of electric loads with different characteristic should be further analyzed. Based on the mathematical model of hydraulic system and mechanical system, the load models with different characteristic are introduced and the numerical analytical model with state equations is built. Then, the effect of load characteristic on operation stability is investigated in detail. For a built single-unit and single-pipe hydropower station running with static load or dynamic load, the obtained solution <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>curves</b> is identical with that of experimental research.

50|$|This {{movement}} is the apotheosis of Hindemith's mastery of classical forms. It functions {{both as an}} unusual set of variations, as its name suggests, and as a full-fledged Sonata-Allegro movement. As indicated by the continuation of variations numbers from the previous movement, the theme being varied is the one from that movement, which functions as the second theme in Sonata-Allegro terminology. The first theme, introduced immediately {{at the beginning of}} the movement, is the very distinctive figure of a turn followed by an ascending scale. This figure is played and elaborated on by the soloist, with the pianist providing tonicizing changes of harmony at each instance of the turn figure. The viola then transforms this figure into the beginning of a more lyrical theme, which brings the music down in <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> level. The main theme returns momentarily, only to falter and give way to a new quiet theme which is a continuance of the rhythmic developments made by the first softer section. This theme, quick downward steps followed by a gentle Mannheim rocket and another set of descending steps, may easily be mistaken for a second theme, when in fact it is an extension and transformation of the movement's opening gesture.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{engages with}} complex issues of musical {{expression}} and movement, and their relation, {{on the one}} hand, to musical structure and, on the other hand, to embodied musical experience. It aims {{to fill a gap}} in music theory and analysis: most methods overemphasise abstract conceptualisation of structural relations {{at the expense of the}} more dynamic, intuitive aspect of musical experience. As a solution, it offers a specific analytical method that can be used to explore dynamic aspects of music as experienced through the whole body. Drawing mainly on nineteenth-century piano music, I analyse aspects of structure in both composition and performance in terms of expressive and motional qualities, revealing the relationship between musical and physical movement. Expressivity in music derives its meaning, at least partly, from the embodied experience of music: performers shape expression through their whole body while listeners react to it in a comparable way, albeit less overtly. Two related systems of graphic notation are introduced, which provide a non-verbal means of representing expressive movement and at the same time encourage an immediate, visceral relationship to the music. The first notation captures the animated quality of expressive movement by analogy with the motion of a bouncing ball, while the second breaks down the expressive musical flow into discrete gestural patterns of specific motional character. While the ultimate value of this method lies in the analytical process it instigates, it also provides a novel theoretical framework that sheds light on the interaction, as well as integration, between structures such as metre, rhythm, harmony and voice-leading, which are traditionally studied mostly independently. In addition, it provides a useful tool for the study and communication of performance interpretation, based on data extracted from recordings in the form of <b>tempo</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> fluctuation graphs.

40|$|A common {{approach}} for determining musical competence is {{to rely on}} information about individuals’ extent of musical training, but relying on musicianship status fails to identify musically untrained individuals with musical skill, {{as well as those}} who, despite extensive musical training, may not be as skilled. To counteract this limitation, the working aim of this thesis was to develop a new test battery (The Profile of Music Perception Skills; PROMS) that measures perceptual musical skills across multiple domains: tonal (melody, pitch), qualitative (timbre, tuning), temporal (rhythm, rhythmto- melody, accent, <b>tempo),</b> <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> (loudness). The development and validation of the PROMS are presented in studies 1 to 4. Overall, the PROMS has satisfactory psychometric properties for the composite score and fair to good coefficients for the individual subtests. Convergent validity was established with the relevant dimensions of Gordon’s Advanced Measures of Music Audiation and Musical Aptitude Profile (melody, rhythm, tempo), the Musical Ear Test (rhythm), and sample instrumental sounds (timbre). Criterion validity is evidenced by a sizeable relationship between test performance and a composite of various indicators of musical proficiency as well as discriminant validity by a generic auditory discrimination task. The application of the PROMS in examining the structure of music perception mechanism is also presented. In particular, the relationship between music perception skills and non-musical abilities is explored in Study 4. The results suggest that the interrelationships among the various subtests could be accounted for by two higher order factors, sensory and structural music processing; the structural processing skill is related to short-term and working memory. Rhythm perception (rhythm and rhythm-to-melody subtests) also shows significant correlation with general mental ability. An Internet study with the PROMS was conducted to examine whether the findings of controlled studies can be replicated with a more diverse population and uncontrolled environment. Most of the findings of the controlled studies were replicated in the Internet study with several exceptions that are reported in Study 5.

40|$|Processing {{of metals}} using severe plastic {{deformation}} (SPD) {{is now a}} well-established procedure for refining the grain size of bulk samples to the submicrometer or nanometer level. Often, high pressure torsion (HPT) techniques are used in which a small, coin-shaped sample is subjected to a torsional deformation under high hydrostatic pressure. The thus obtained samples show exceptional mechanical properties including a significantly higher strength. For face centred cubic (fcc) metals often an increased strain rate sensitivity is reported which will contribute to a higher tensile ductility. Because of the intrinsic heterogeneity and small size of HPT samples, characterization of their mechanical behaviour is not straightforward. In present study, the static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> tensile behaviour of commercially pure aluminium (99. 6 wt%) processed by HPT is studied. From the 15 mm diameter HPT disks, miniature dogbone samples are extracted which are subjected to a tensile load with strain rates ranging from 2. 8 × 10 - 3 s- 1 to 5 × 103 s- 1. The high strain rate tensile behaviour is characterized using a purpose-developed miniature split Hopkinson tensile bar setup. During the tests, the deformation of a speckle pattern applied to the samples is recorded, by which local information on the strain is obtained using a digital image correlation technique. The fracture surfaces of the tensile samples are studied by scanning electron microscopy. The tensile test results reveal a considerable increase in the ultimate tensile strength of the HPT processed aluminium: after one HPT revolution -corresponding with an equivalent von Mises strain of 10 - the strength doubled. However, the increase in strength is {{at the expense of}} tensile ductility. The strain rate dependence of the flow stress is found to be low; differences between the static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>curves</b> are attributed to thermal softening. In the fracture surfaces anisotropic deformations are observed, especially at low levels of HPT deformation. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements show that the grain size decreases from 300 μm in the annealed state to ~ 1 μm at an applied shear strain of 20. EBSD texture data reveal a typical very weak fcc simple shear texture which is further randomised by the very severe grain fragmentation...|$|R
