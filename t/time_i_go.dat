25|$|I'm very sentimental and {{the place}} gets to me every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone {{watching}} me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E

2500|$|During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary Theresa May said: [...] "I {{think this}} is about sheer criminality. That {{is what we have}} seen on the streets. The {{violence}} we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it." [...] Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for One News said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots [...] "recreational violence". A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back in now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back to the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|Nick and Sharon's highly {{anticipated}} 2009 reunion was {{met with}} a notable public reaction. SoapNet wrote [...] "the stage was being set for a much-anticipated reunion between first loves Nick Newman and Sharon Collins. Nick's wife, Phyllis, had been scheming to keep them apart for months, {{and a lot of}} fans were looking forward to her comeuppance just as much as Nick and Sharon's hookup." [...] Additionally, the Soap Opera Network magazine noted a [...] "sudden boom" [...] in ratings in the episodes surrounding their reunion, which was also attributed to other subplots. The show gained 447,000 total viewers for the week of January 26–30, which was described as [...] "pretty incredible" [...] by SoapNet. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said, [...] "Many fans were overjoyed that Nick and Sharon finally reconnected and made love in the cabin." [...] Of working with Joshua Morrow, Case stated: [...] "I feel most comfortable when I am working with him. We have worked together for so many years, and even if I have not worked with him in a long <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> right back into a groove with him that’s familiar and easy".|$|E
60|$|So, as aforesaid, on {{the first}} kindly day of this year, being {{thoughtful}} more than usual of those old <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to look again at the place.|$|R
60|$|Seeing I {{could not}} effect my object that night, I {{thought it best}} to defer it for the present; and {{returning}} among the sailors, Jackson asked me how I had found the captain, and whether the next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> <b>I</b> would not take a friend along and introduce him.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout his {{childhood}} in Barcelona, Carreras's father, Josep Carreras i Soler, worked as a traffic policeman. He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, {{he was no longer}} allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly. In José Carreras: A Life Story, he said that [...] "even now, every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on stage, I always, always, have a quick thought for her." [...] In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes Pérez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta Jäger, but separated from her in 2011. Carreras's nephew, David Giménez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simfònica del Vallès. He has conducted [...] many of Carreras's concerts since the late 1990s as well as his opera performances in Sly at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in June 2000.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is a pool," [...] she said, [...] "a {{few hundred}} yards away there, on the right. I found it the second <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> away, and <b>I</b> did enjoy a wash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{answered}} Mr. Bridmain; 'they show us {{into such}} a bad pew at Milby--just {{where there is a}} draught from that door. I caught a stiff neck the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at {{that girl}} who's just going out," [...] said Mildred. [...] "She got them furs at the Bon Marche at Brixton. I saw {{them in the}} window last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} another medical opinion," [...] he answered, [...] "before we decide. The next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to see him, a {{physician}} from Brighton shall go with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} intrusion," [...] he said. [...] "In half an {{hour from}} this <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> with this copy to the printer's. Till then I am at rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} here, Bone; I was just {{thinking}} about it, that's all. You're always drumming it into me about not taking anything for granted. Anyway, by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to Plato I'll know----" ...|$|E
60|$|After this I {{remember}} no more, for <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to sleep, and so {{remained for}} about twenty-four hours. This was not wonderful, seeing that {{for two days}} and nights practically I had not rested, during which <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through much fatigue and many emotions.|$|R
6000|$|Maud Barrington {{laughed a}} little. [...] "Yes," [...] she said quietly. [...] "I {{think it would}} if the girl is wise. Even now such things do happen, but I fancy it is <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> back again." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Jacksonville Observer she stated, [...] "I really was heartbroken over him (Bret Michaels) for a long <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on there and I did {{fall in love with}} him, but we remain friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll see," [...] said Jim. [...] "Next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> myself. I'll take Mamie for the trip: Longhurst won't refuse me {{the expense}} of a schooner. You wait till I get the searching of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will bring}} in the ropes next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out. Mind {{and place them in}} your bed. You will know that that night at eleven o'clock your son will be on the terrace {{awaiting}} you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll fetch {{you some}} next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> over to Ballad's. Tell {{me what you}} want, and we'll have a posy bed somewhere round, see if we don't," [...] said her father, dimly {{understanding}} what she wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are cutting}} us off from Brother Redwood. Last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{to him the}} red notices had crept a mile in, either way. The road to him along the Downs {{is no more than}} a narrow lane." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jack Black himself {{attended}} a Sunday performance, and afterwards told the cast backstage, [...] "There {{were so many}} <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> ‘I {{could not have done}} it that well.’ You made me laugh. You made me cry. You made me rock.’" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was no hurry. I {{had passed}} for master, and I {{had all the}} rest of my life before me to make the best of it. That seemed a long <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> leisurely through a small mental calculation, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. You {{know very}} well that {{that has nothing to do}} with it. From this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> my own way in my own {{business}} and among my own friends. And you will go yours. [She rises]. Goodbye.|$|E
6000|$|... "The next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out {{it will be}} with {{somebody}} who can manage a boat, and who is brave enough to do it, even in a storm," [...] said Dora, and walked away with her lady friends.|$|E

6000|$|... "There I am {{not much}} of a judge. I never had any young ladyhood, but I own that the few <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out with Anna I have been {{surprised}}, and more surprised at what I heard from her sister Emily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{lost them}} {{somewhere in the}} air," [...] {{explained}} the child. [...] "But the second <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King's Magic Belt, {{which is much more}} powerful than were the Silver Shoes." ...|$|R
