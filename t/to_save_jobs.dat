25|$|In late 2008, the Russian {{government}} introduced protectionist measures, worth $5billion, {{to improve}} {{the situation in the}} industry. This included $2billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars. Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>jobs.</b> The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50% and go up to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy. To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.|$|E
