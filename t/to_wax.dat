5|$|After peaking in intensity, {{the storm}} began {{weakening}} due to increasing easterly wind shear from the ridge to the north, displacing {{the center of}} circulation from the deepest convection. Early on May14, the IMD downgraded the storm to a severe cyclonic storm. Around this time, steering currents slackened, and the cyclone meandered northward over the central Bay of Bengal. By late on May14, convection had largely dissipated, {{with the exception of}} a small area near the center, and the system weakened to minimal cyclonic storm status. Thunderstorm activity continued <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> and wane as the storm turned to the southeastward, though persistent hostile conditions caused the storm to weaken further to a deep depression on May16. As the nearby ridge translated eastward, the depression was able to move more steadily to the east and later to the northeast, passing northwest of the Andaman Islands on May18. On the next day, the deep depression re-intensified into a cyclonic storm, reaching a secondary peak with winds of 85km/h (50mph). At about 10:00UTC on May19, the storm made landfall close to Kyaukpyu, Ramree Island, in western Myanmar. The storm rapidly weakened into a depression and later degenerated into a low pressure area on May20, and was no longer discernible on satellite imagery by the next day.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease in shear allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to {{turn back to the}} west-southwest. Moving back beneath an anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, with the small structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E

Rasmussen felt this was a little strange, since Lazarus was dressed in flattering workout clothes, and after Lazarus left asked her fiancé if their relationship was truly over. Ruetten convinced her the two were just friends. A few days later Lazarus returned, in uniform and armed, after he had left for work, to pick the waxed skis up.|$|E

25|$|Candlepin bowling is a North American {{variation}} of bowling that is played {{primarily in the}} Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. A candlepin bowling lane somewhat resembles lanes used in tenpin bowling. However, unlike tenpin bowling lanes that are flat, candlepin lanes are slightly depressed ahead of the pindeck. The candlepins themselves take on a cylindrical shape which are tapered at the tops and bottoms, thus giving them a resemblance <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> candles. In 1880, candlepin bowling was invented by Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand, educated by the Jesuits, was {{a staunch}} Catholic {{who wanted to}} impose {{religious}} uniformity on his lands. This made him highly unpopular in Protestant (primarily Hussite) Bohemia. The Bohemian nobility rejected Ferdinand, who had been elected Bohemian Crown Prince in 1617. Ferdinand's representatives were thrown out of a window in Prague and seriously injured, triggering the Thirty Years' War in 1618. This so-called Defenestration of Prague provoked open revolt in Bohemia, which had powerful foreign allies. Ferdinand was upset by the calculated insult, but his intolerant policies in his own lands had left him in a weak position. The Habsburg cause {{in the next few}} years would seem to suffer unrecoverable reverses. The Protestant cause seemed <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> toward a quick overall victory.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Tiglath-Pileser I Assyria entered a period of decline during what is {{referred}} to as the Ancient Dark Ages (1075-912 BC)in the region that corresponded to the collapse of the Bronze Age. The last 300 years of the Assyrian Empire (Neo-Assyrian Empire) from 911-627 BC saw a renewed expansion including attacks on the Neo-Hittite states to its north and west. Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) extracted tribute from Phrygia while his successor Shalmaneser III (858–823 BC) also attacked Urartu forcing his Anatolian neighbours to pay tribute. After his death the land was torn by civil war. Assyrian power continued <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> and wane with periodic incursions into the Anatolian lands. Sennacherib (705-681 BC) encountered and drove back a new force in the region, the Greeks who attempted to settle Cilicia. His successor Esarhaddon (680-669 BC) was responsible for the final destruction of Urartu. Ashurbanipal (669-627 BC) then extended Assyrian influence still further placing Caria, Cilicia, Lydia and Cappadocia into vasselage.|$|E

Spent and Coleman also mixed {{the track}} at the Record Plant. Williams' {{production}} team, The Neptunes, produced the track, with Madonna. The song was written by Madonna and Williams, with rap vocals by West, and the title is a reference to The Whispers' disco track [...] "And the Beat Goes On" [...] (1980). [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] is a disco song, with funk and hip-hop influences, drum beat and bell chimes, as well as Williams' shimmering, thumping production, which according to Bradley Stern from Idolator, [...] "offers Madonna the perfect groove <b>to</b> <b>wax</b> bombastic about the cathartic pleasures of dancing."

500|$|To {{promote the}} album's release, Madonna {{talked about the}} album in an audio message {{available}} exclusively online prior to its release.

I'm {{going to be a good}} girl, I swear." [...] One of the first promotional appearances the singer did was in Paris, where she was interviewed by Ruby Wax and talked about the album. According <b>to</b> <b>Wax,</b> she was quite intimidated by Madonna and her entourage and, in her own words, [...] " [...] nerves got the best of me".

500|$|The Civil Rights Movement sparked extremist {{antisemitism}} in the South, and [...] "Communist Jews" [...] were {{blamed for}} destroying democracy following the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Southern Jews {{found themselves in}} a difficult position; they were a vulnerable minority whose status in Southern white society was marginal and conditional on their acceptance of the status quo. Because of these concerns, particularly after the 1958 bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple in Atlanta, the congregation did not want Wax taking a public stand on civil rights. In addition, though Wax supported racial integration, not all his congregants did; according <b>to</b> <b>Wax,</b> [...] "Almost all native-born Southerners whose families lived in the South for two or more generations have segregationist attitudes." [...] Rather than getting involved in public protests, Wax worked with groups supporting integration, such as the Memphis Ministers Association. He also encouraged Temple Israel's members to join groups like the Panel of American Women, an interfaith and inter-racial group that spoke in favor of religious and racial tolerance at community events and whose Memphis chapter was founded by congregation member Jocelyn Wurzburg. Temple Israel member Myra Dreifus co-founded Memphis's Fund for Needy Schoolchildren in the 1960s. It helped provide food for hungry schoolchildren, primarily in black schools, and later expanded its efforts to include the distribution of free or discounted clothing and footwear. The group had both white and black women as members, including members of Temple Israel, and because of Dreifus's role in the Fund, Temple Israel itself supported it. By 1968, members of the Sisterhood were donating money so that tutors could be bussed to the majority African-American Kansas Street School. According to professor of women's and gender studies Kimberly K. Little, this [...] "marked the first occasion where Temple Israel opened its doors to community–based programs; its prior charitable work focused on Jewish community outreach".|$|E

2500|$|Base: The {{bottom of}} the board that is {{in contact with the}} snow surface. It is {{generally}} made of a porous, plastic (polyethylene) material, that is saturated with a wax to create a very quick and smooth, hydrophobic surface. P-Tex is a brand name that has become synonymous with base material. It is important that the base be [...] "slippery", with respect to the snow surface and board interaction. Bases are made to have amorphous areas that are porous <b>to</b> <b>wax.</b> Wax is an important finishing product for all base materials. Not only does it allow the snowboard to have a smoother glide, but it also allows the rider to change the characteristics of the base and adjust the board to the snow conditions. Different base waxes are available for different temperatures. The base, when maintained, will have a designed base structure that not only channels snow, air and water, but leaves it open enough for wax to penetrate deep inside it. This pattern is created with a stonegrind machine at the factory or a local ski shop. If the base is damaged, it is common to have it repaired {{in order to protect the}} core from exposure as well as reducing friction.|$|E
