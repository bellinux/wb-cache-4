40|$|Phosphate {{reduction}} is of important industrial relevance {{in the manufacturing}} of emulsifi ed meat products because it may {{give rise to a}} healthier product. The eff ect of seven diff erent phosphate types was tested on the physicochemical and quality characteristics to select the most promising phosphate type for further cooked sausage manufacturing. Next, phosphate mass fraction was gradually reduced. <b>Tetrasodium</b> di- or <b>pyrophosphate</b> (TSPP) and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) increased pH, reduced structural properties, resulted in the highest emulsion stability, lowest cooking loss and had litt le eff ect on hardness. Based on the viscoelastic properties, a minimum mass fraction of 0. 06 % TSPP was suffi cient to obtain an acceptable quality product. Rheology proved to be a very useful tool to evaluate the quality of meat products, as it gives insight {{in the structure of the}} meat product and especially the functional properties of meat proteins. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the current amount of phosphate added to emulsifi ed meat products can be signifi cantly reduced with minimal loss of product quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{addition}} of selected inorganic phosphates to emulsion meat products were studied. All studies were designed to test basic theories regarding inorganic phosphates and meat under practical conditions. For the most part, evaluations were made on raw emulsions made in a small laboratory food chopper. In an attempt to stress the emulsions, low sodium chloride levels were frequently used. Evaluations included emulsion stability, soluble protein level, pH, emulsion viscosity and reflected surface color. At reduced sodium chloride levels, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and tetrapotassium pyrophosphate improved emulsion stability more than sodium tripolyphosphate or potassium tripolyphosphate. Preblending with <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> was {{not found to be}} detrimental to the stability of reduced sodium chloride meat emulsions. The addition of sodium hydroxide was similar to the effect of <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> on emulsion stability, but when combined with phosphates reduced soluble protein level and cooked product yields. The high emulsion pH due to sodium hydroxide and alkaline phosphates reduced cured color development; however, treatments were investigated which improved the cured color of phosphate-treated emulsions.

Ten healthy individuals (aged between 18 and 30 years) were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. Participants received instructions on daily dental flossing and the interventions were randomly performed in 2 different groups (NT or PP) of five individuals each according to the dental flosses. Individuals were instructed to use each dental floss with a total of six slides on the two interproximal aspects of target teeth (3 slides on each interproximal aspect). A washout period of one week was used before start flossing interventions and after each type of dental floss to prevent any bias related to the exposure to any product that contained the active ingredient. Samples were collected by # 35 sterilized absorbent paper points from interdental fluid after flossing and assessed by ion chromatography. The levels of residual <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> were evaluated by means of binomial generalized linear model proportions and canonical link function. Both dental flosses were effective in <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> release at therapeutic levels in the interdental gingival crevicular fluid for a period of up to 2 h after use. No significant differences were found between both groups (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Four {{batches of}} pasteurized process cheese were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate, disodium phosphate, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and emulsifying salt concentration (2. 5 %). The process cheese was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each emulsifying salt affected the physical properties of the process cheese differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. <b>Tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on process cheese should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|E

A. summary of the findings are as follows: 1. Sodium tetraphosphate appeared to be the most effective antimycotic compound used in this investigation. A 10 per cent concentration of sodium tetraphosphate appeared to be the most effective antimycotic compound used in this investigation. A 10 per cent concentration of sodium tetraphosphate inhibited fungal growth on fresh cherries up to 30 days of storage at 34 degrees Farenheight and 94 per cent relative humidity, while the untreated controls showed fungal growth after 14 days at refrigeration storage. 2.

40|$|In this study, 1, 5 -glucono-Î´-lactone, {{was used}} to achieve acid-induced {{gelation}} of meat, myofibrillar protein and myosin at 4 Â°C. The mechanisms of gelation of myofibrillar protein and myosin were investigated. The effects of addition of sodium chloride and <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> to myosin and myofibrillar protein, with and without 1, 5 -glucono-Î´-lactone, were also studied. In addition, {{the presence of other}} phosphates, orthophosphatc, tripolyphosphate and hexametaphosphate, in a myosin system were studied to aid in an understanding of the the observed effects of <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> on myosin. At about pH 4. 5, it was observed that extraction of the A-band of myofibrillar protein occurred. It was suggested that an impregnated composite system of myosin reinforcing the myofibrillar structure had formed. At about pH 4. 0, complete extraction of the A-band occurred. Dissolution of the myofibrillar structure was suggested to result in myosin network formation of weaker Young's Modulus than the impregnated composite system. Addition of 1, 5 -glucono-Î´-lactone to myosin resulted in the exposure of hydrophobic sites as the pH decreased and it was suggested that acid-induced denaturation had occurred. Gel formation occurred parallel to denaturation. At pH 4. 0, the gel became liquid-like and was suggested to be a result of excess repulsive electrostatic interactions. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were shown to be involved in gel formation, whereas sulfhydryl bonding appeared not to be involved in gelation. Sodium chloride was postulated to enhance gel rigidity through its effects on the isoelectric point of myosin. The inclusion of <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> resulted in network formation prior to acid-induced denaturation and was suggested to enhance hydrogen bonding. The acid-induced gels appeared to revert to myosin or myofibrillar protein when immersed in quiescent water, a condition where unimpeded diffusion of ions was obtained. However, a slow rate of ion diffusion resulted in the formation of a 'strong', translucent gel which was dense {{to the point of being}} effectively impermeable to ion migration. These gels were hypothesized to have formed through the displacement of sodium and potassium ions with protons, enhancing hydrogen bonding.

Acid casein cheese models were subjected to sodium hydroxide conditioning at 65 C in the cooker. Model process cheeses were acidified with lactic acid and treated by addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein, four different emulsifying salts and sodium oxalate. Meltability and toughness of the model cheese increased to a maximum with increased sodium hydroxide conditioning of acid casein to pH 7. 20. These same properties decreased with addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein to both casein cheese models. Loss of emulsion occurred during the meltability test of rennet casein cheese models with 3. 0 and 4. 5 % added whey protein. Emulsifying salts affected the models differently. Disodium phosphate and <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> in rennet casein models eliminated the melting property. These same salts in acid casein models produced excellent meltability. Trisodium citrate produced cheeses with good meltability in both acid and rennet casein cheese models. Acid casein cheese models prepared with sodium aluminum phosphate had fair meltability and were very tender (no rupture upon compression). Chelation of calcium by sodium oxalate in rennet casein cheese emulsified with disodium phosphate or <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> improved meltability with a corresponding increase in toughness. Scanning electron micrographs of model process cheeses indicated a direct relationship between extent of emulsification and poor meltability of rennet and pH conditioned acid casein model cheeses.

The cheeses manufactured with TSC, TSPP, and STPP behaved like concentrated solutions, while the cheese manufactured with SHMP exhibited weak gel behavior and the lowest values for the phase angle (G"/G'). This means that SHMP cheese had the protein network with the largest amount of molecular interactions, which can be explained by its highest degree of fat emulsification. Rotational viscometry indicated that all the spreadable cheeses behaved like pseudoplastic fluids. The cheeses made with SHMP and TSPP presented low values for the flow behavior index, meaning that viscosity was more dependent on shear rate. Regarding the consistency index, TSPP cheese showed the highest value, which could be attributed to the combined effect of its high pH and homogeneous fat particle size distribution. 201...|$|E

After injection, breasts were tumbled in a cold room in a laboratory-sized tumbler for 2 hr at 20 rpm with alternate intervals of tumbling for 10 min and 10 min of rest {{for a total of}} 1 hr of tumbling. The presence of salt, during tumbling, significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses but did not significantly affect shear values. All of the phosphates used significantly reduced expressible moisture and cooking losses without influencing shear values. Sensory properties (binding ability, juiciness, and flavor) of rolls made from tumbled meat were significantly improved when the breast muscle was tumbled in the presence of salt and phosphates. A combination of sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate significantly improved extractability of myofibrillar proteins during the tumbling process as compared to other phosphate sources. These results generally indicated that the presence of both salt and polyphosphates during tumbling improve sensory properties of turkey rolls. (Key words: tumbling, turkey muscle, salt, phosphates...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{surface area of}} three layered silicates was determined by three independent methods; it was estimated from the average dimensions of individual silicate layers, determined by nitrogen adsorption using the BET model and calculated from the adsorption of methylene blue on their surface in aqueous sol. The BET model gave smaller surface areas than expected, because nitrogen molecules cannot penetrate freely into the interlayer space of the silicates. Geometric calculations and the methylene blue approach yielded very similar values for {{two different types of}} Laponite when the pH of the dispersion was adjusted to 6. 5 or the edges of the silicate were modified with <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> dispersing agent. The measurement of surface area in water without the control of pH yielded smaller surface area, because methylene blue decreased the pH of the solution resulting in the competitive adsorption of methylene blue cations and protons at the basal surface. The methylene blue approach resulted in larger surface area than expected for the silicate with large ion exchange capacity, because of the tilted orientation of the adsorbed methylene blue molecules. All these factors must be considered during the use of the methylene blue method for the determination of the {{specific surface}} area of smectites...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the viability of use of sodium phosphate (Na 3 PO 4 : SP), <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (Na 4 P 2 O 7 : TSPP) and hydroxyethylidene-diphosphonic acid (C 2 H 8 O 7 P 2 : HEDP) as a non-toxic corrosion inhibitors of steel bars in alkaline media which simulate the electrolyte in the concrete pores. The effectiveness of these phosphate compounds as corrosion inhibitors was investigated by measuring the corrosion potentials, the polarization curves, the corrosion current densities, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of steel bars immersed for 30 days in saturated Ca(OH) 2 solutions with and without chlorides. At the completion of the tests, the mass losses were determined in order to verify the reliability of the electrochemical results. The results showed that phosphate compounds form a protective layer on the steel surface when immersed in alkaline solution without chlorides. In the presence of chloride ions, the SP acts as an anodic inhibitor and reduces the corrosion activity on steel. The HEDP shows lower efficiency, probably due to the decrease of the pH and to the high [Clâ]/[inh] ratio used. Results obtained by electrochemical and gravimetric methods are in quite reasonable agreement. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to show how {{microbial}} transglutaminase (mTG) can be used as an effective texture-modifier for two popular Hungarian products: Trappist cheese and frankfurter. In both cases we investigated how components of these products, milkfat in cheese and phosphate in frankfurter, can be substituted by mTG. Therefore, Trappist cheese samples were produced from cow milk of 2. 8 %, 3. 5 %, and 5 % milk fat. The effect of ripening was evaluated with Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and sensory evaluation (scoring test, 10 trained panellists). Springiness and cohesiveness values were significantly higher by enzyme-treated semi-hard cheese samples at lower milk fat levels. Sensory evaluation showed that the enzyme-treatment led to higher scores by cheese samples made from cow milk of 3. 5 % and 5 % milk fat. Frankfurter was made with 0. 1 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 5 %, and 0. 7 % <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and partly enzyme-treated with 0. 2 % commercial mTG enzyme preparation. Our results showed that mTG is able to significantly improve hardness and crunchiness by frankfurters made with 0. 1 % phosphate addition. Our sensory evaluation suggests that mTG and phosphate should be applied in combination in order to have a final product with recognisably more homogeneous texture...|$|E
