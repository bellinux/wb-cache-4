40|$|The time {{course of}} <b>twitch</b> {{depression}} following neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) administration {{is influenced by}} the duration of control neuromuscular monitoring (<b>twitch</b> stabilization). The physiological mechanism for this interaction is not known. During <b>twitch</b> stabilization <b>twitch</b> response often increases to a plateau, this is known as <b>twitch</b> potentiation or the staircase phenomenon. Since <b>twitch</b> potentiation contributes to the observed <b>twitch</b> response it may also influence the time course of <b>twitch</b> depression following NMBA administration. Our objective was to estimate the degree that <b>twitch</b> potentiation influences the time course of <b>twitch</b> depression following NMBA administration under conditions typical for muscle relaxation studies. We used previously described pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) and <b>twitch</b> potentiation models to simulate <b>twitch</b> data. Simulations consisted of <b>twitch</b> stabilization followed by a NMBA bolus close and subsequent onset and recovery front muscle relaxation. <b>Twitch</b> data were analyzed for onset and recovery characteristics and the results compared to clinical muscle relaxation studies in existing literature. We found that <b>twitch</b> potentiation likely plays a minor role in shortened onset time and increased duration of <b>twitch</b> depression observed with long periods of <b>twitch</b> stabilization...|$|R
50|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{composed}} of long cylindrical cells called muscle fibers. There {{are two types of}} muscle fibers, slow <b>twitch</b> or muscle contraction (type I) and fast <b>twitch</b> (type II). Slow <b>twitch</b> fibers are more efficient in using oxygen to generate energy, while fast <b>twitch</b> fibers are less efficient. However, fast <b>twitch</b> fibers fire more rapidly and generate more force. Fast <b>twitch</b> fibers and slow <b>twitch</b> fibers are also called white muscle fibers and red muscles fibers, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Finally, no {{significant}} difference between injuries from muscles that are primarily slow <b>twitch</b> compared to muscles that are primarily fast <b>twitch</b> was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Skeletal muscle <b>twitch</b> {{responses}} may be transiently {{increased by}} previous contractions, a phenomenon termed <b>twitch</b> potentiation. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the extent and time course of diaphragmatic <b>twitch</b> potentiation and its relationship to both the magnitude and duration of the preceding voluntary diaphragmatic contraction. METHODS [...] <b>Twitch</b> transdiaphragmatic pressure (PDI) was measured in six normal subjects, before and after voluntary diaphragm contractions of 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, and 25 % of maximum PDI (PDImax) sustained for five and 10 seconds. RESULTS [...] <b>Twitch</b> PDI was significantly increased after 100 %, 75 %, and 50 % contractions. Following maximal contractions sustained for 10 seconds the mean increase in <b>twitch</b> PDI was 52 %. Following 50 % contractions sustained for five seconds the mean increase in <b>twitch</b> height was 28 %. In all runs <b>twitch</b> PDI returned to rested levels within 20 minutes. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Twitch</b> potentiation can be substantial, even following submaximal contractions, and must be taken into account when <b>twitch</b> pressure is used to assess diaphragm contractility...|$|R
50|$|Compression of {{a trigger}} point may elicit local tenderness, {{referred}} pain, or local <b>twitch</b> response. The local <b>twitch</b> response {{is not the}} same as a muscle spasm. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle contracting whereas the local <b>twitch</b> response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small <b>twitch,</b> no contraction.|$|R
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, <b>twitching,</b> and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The <b>twitching</b> effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and <b>twitching,</b> suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.|$|E

50|$|A single {{motor neuron}} may {{innervate}} many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials {{in the time}} taken for a single muscle <b>twitch.</b> As a result, if an action potential arrives before a <b>twitch</b> has completed, the <b>twitches</b> can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction. In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive {{before the end of}} the <b>twitch.</b> The <b>twitches</b> thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single <b>twitch.</b> A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual <b>twitches</b> are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.|$|R
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, <b>twitching</b> (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and <b>twitching</b> on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils <b>twitching,</b> when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

40|$|The {{involvement}} of presynaptic serotonergic {{activity in the}} fenfluramine-induced head <b>twitches</b> was investigated using various drugs in 2 -month-and 10 -month-old mice. Mice administerd fenfluramine produced head <b>twitches</b> which were inhibited by methysergide and cyproheptadine, serotonergic antagonist. The freqency of head <b>twitches</b> induced by fenfluramine and 5 -methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT) was higher in 10 -month-old mice than in 2 -month-old mice. Pretreatments with p-chlorophnylalanine (PCPA), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, and reserpine an amine depletor, significantly potentiated 5 -MeODMT-induced head <b>twitches</b> in 2 -month-old mice, but did not affect those in 10 -month-old mice. Pretreatment with PCPA inhibited fenfluramine : induced head <b>twitches</b> in either 2 -month-or 10 -monthe-old mice, whereas pretreatment with reserpine inhibited the head <b>twitches</b> in 10 -month-old mice but did not change the head <b>twitches</b> in 2 -month-old mice.
