5|$|As screenwriter, Fellowes {{sought to}} make the film as {{historically}} accurate as possible. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell and historical consultant Alastair Bruce were hired, and filming for The Young Victoria took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, {{various aspects of the}} film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Keeping <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> it is {{not hard}} to see why {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers. The communication based train control (CBTC) is being used which enables trains to run at a short headway of 90 seconds. Keeping <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> and other constraints, DMRC changed its decision to build 9-car-long stations for new lines and instead opting for shorter stations which can accommodate 6-car trains.|$|E

5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new Hunter enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The Hunter serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter is a powerful and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, war between Britain and Germany {{began to seem}} likely. Ramsgate's {{location}} on both the English Channel and North Sea and its proximity to the Thames Estuary, its large port facilities, and its close proximity to RAF Manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any German invasion of Britain. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the town's borough engineer and surveyor, R. D. Brimmell, devised a scheme in 1938 for a network of tunnels beneath the town, {{to serve as a}} vast deep-level air-raid shelter for the town's inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> the head of Aravan is consigned to the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E

5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the parish council in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} an {{exciting}} period, but Honoré I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E

5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E
5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created {{if it were not}} for playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga was {{targeted}} to Treasure's core fanbase, as pleasing {{them was the}} team's first priority. Although the game was primarily being developed for the Sega NAOMI arcade platform, it was standard for NAOMI games to be ported to the Dreamcast, and so the development team had <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> The NAOMI version was bug checked on a Dreamcast, so porting was very easy. Ikaruga was first released in arcades in Japan on 20 December 2001. A Dreamcast port was released exclusively in Japan on 5 September 2002. Although not yet published in the West, Ikaruga began to garner a cult following in North America among import gamers. On 16 January 2003, Infogrames published Ikaruga for the GameCube in Japan under their Atari label. Later that month Infogrames confirmed the GameCube version of Ikaruga would come to North America and Europe, with Infogrames representatives citing the popularity of Ikaruga in Japan and growing fan base around the world. The game was finally released on 15 April 2003 In North America and 9 May 2003 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twelfth century, the Earldom of Orkney, {{although}} weakened {{since the time}} of Earl Thorfinn, remained in control of Caithness and was dominant in Sutherland and parts of the Outer Hebrides. Thus the succession of the earldom was of great interest to the Scots king David I. The marriage of Matad and Margaret is believed to have taken place not long before 1134, shortly following David's suppression of a major revolt involving Mormaer Óengus of Moray, grandson of king Lulach, and Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, the illegitimate son of David's brother Alexander, and the subsequent extension of royal power into the provinces of Moray and Ross. David's nephew William fitz Duncan was appointed to rule Moray, and it has been proposed that Matad, whose power lay in the Scottish kingdom's heartland of Atholl, may also have been granted authority in the new lands north of the Mounth, and that his marriage to Margarat Haakonsdaughter was arranged with <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E
