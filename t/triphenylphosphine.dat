40|$|Direct {{labeling}} of salmon calcitonin (sCT) {{is possible in}} one step using water-soluble phosphines (sulfonated <b>triphenylphosphines)</b> as the reducing agent both for disulfide and for pertechnetate. Phosphines were the most efficient reducing agent for disulfide bonds among those examined.

In contrast, the phosphines did not reduce rhenium below oxidation state V, nor did they participate in the rhenium coordination sphere in the labeled peptide. Instead, the expected oxorhenium(V) moiety was incorporated. Both Tc and Re labeling processes gave rise to dimers with two peptides linked by the metal center, as well as simple monomeric species. Positive mode electrospray mass spectrometry not only revealed the presence of phosphine bound to technetium and oxygen bound to rhenium in the metallopeptides but also revealed the oxidation states of the metals.

Interestingly, the PAR and the PAN ligands are not planar in the synthesized complexes. The ligands coordinate to the central copper(I) ions by only two nitrogen atoms: one from pyridine and one from an azo group. The oxygen atoms from the hydroxyl groups do not form bonds with copper, but take part in strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which stabilize the conformations of the ligands.

25|$|Substitutions to {{pyridine}} at the 2- or 4-position {{result in}} an energetically unfavorable σ complex. They can be promoted, however, using experimental techniques, such as conducting electrophilic substitution on the pyridine N-oxide followed by deoxygenation of the nitrogen atom. Addition of oxygen reduces electron density on the nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed via several routes, most commonly with compounds of trivalent phosphorus or divalent sulfur, which are easily oxidized. <b>Triphenylphosphine</b> is a frequently used reagent, which is oxidized in this reaction to <b>triphenylphosphine</b> oxide.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{interaction}} of CO 2 and amines as molecular control factor to influence different kinds of selectivities in various catalytic processes. The reversibility of the Lewis acid-base reaction between CO 2 and amines has been applied in numerous reaction and separation processes and chapter I gives a short overview of the different areas. Up to date this interaction has not been used to steer the selectivity of a reaction and in this context, switchable solvents are applied in the selective homogeneous hydrogenation to steer the chemoselectivity in chapter II. The interaction between CO 2 and amine was ensured by using the switchable solvent system of DBU and 1 -hexanol. This switchable solvent system was characterised in detail {{in order to obtain}} a deeper insight on its effects in the reaction. Different homogeneous rhodium-complexes were evaluated as catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene and 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene and the presence of various bases on the selectivity towards cyclohexene was investigated. As a result, the rhodium-complex [Rh(cod) (dppp) ]BF 4 was selected for further studies including concentration profiles, mechanistic considerations and catalyst recycling in the switchable solvent system. In chapter III, switchable ligands for the control of coordination geometries in catalysis are discussed. These ligands are guanidine substituted <b>triphenylphosphines,</b> which can interact with CO 2 in presence of an alcohol. The synthesis of these ligands is described and the interaction between the ligands, 1 -hexanol and CO 2 is investigated using high-pressure NMR spectroscopy. The largest interaction was found between the meta-substituted ligand. The influence of the switchable ligands on the regioselectivity in the rhodium-catalysed hydroformylation of 1 -octene was tested, where the influence of the substituted position (ortho, meta or para) and different alcohols on the selectivity were evaluated. In chapter IV, switchable catalysts were used for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates derived from styrene oxide and epoxy derivatives from oleo origin. The reaction of styrene oxide with CO 2 in presence of switchable catalysts based on DBU and 1 -hexanol was tested and an optimisation of the reaction conditions was performed. To investigate the influence of the catalysts on the stereoselectivity, the conversion of different epoxy oleo chemicals into cyclic carbonates with simple halide catalysts and switchable catalysts was tested. A clear switch in the product distribution of cis- and trans-cyclic carbonates could be observed with the different catalysts. A detailed evaluation - including mechanistic and stereochemical considerations - was done...|$|R

Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone (scheme 20).|$|E
