5000|$|Semi-trailers {{with two}} trailer units are called B-doubles (Australian English) or <b>tandem</b> <b>tractor</b> trailers, tandem rigs, or doubles (American English). Other terms used are [...] "B-train" [...] or (when {{there are three}} or more trailers) [...] "road train". A B-double {{consists}} of a prime mover towing two semitrailers, where the first semitrailer {{is connected to the}} prime mover by a fifth wheel coupling (a.k.a. 'converter dolly') and the second semitrailer is connected to the first semitrailer by a fifth wheel coupling. In Australian English, the tractor unit is usually referred to as a [...] "prime-mover", and the combination of a prime-mover and trailer is known as a [...] "semitrailer" [...] or [...] "semi".|$|E
5000|$|NEMF {{was awarded}} the National Shippers Strategic Transportation Council Carrier of the Year award in 2005 and 2007, under the Regional-Northeast category. [...] Currently, most New England Motor Freight {{tractors}} are governed to a speed of 68 mi/h km/h. Tractors consist of Ford, International, Mack, and Volvo, both single axle and twin screw, sleeper cabs and day cabs. The tractors consist of both automatic and manual transmissions. Most newer tractors are either Mack or Volvo, Recently NEMF purchased new equipment which included {{in the most recent}} acquisitions are 57 Mack CX613 <b>Tandem</b> Axle <b>Tractors</b> (2012), 10 Volvo 670 Sleepers (2012), 6 International 9200 <b>Tandem</b> Axle <b>Tractors</b> (2012), and 6 Freightliner Cascadia <b>Tandem</b> Axle <b>tractors</b> (2012). The company has also purchased 50 Nissan 5000 lb capacity forklifts and 100 Great Dane 53’ trailers with an option for an additional 100 before year end.|$|R
50|$|As the company's {{cooperation}} with Volvo BM deepened, it started experimenting with {{getting rid of}} the front axle by permanently attaching the trailer and instead provide steering through hydraulic cylinders forcing the trailer and wagon to turn in relation to each other. This was made in analogue with systems already developed for use in <b>tandem</b> <b>tractors</b> (see for example Doe Triple-D). The first purpose built articulated hauler was DR 631, a 4x4, released in 1966 with a larger 6x6 model DR 860 being released in 1968. In 1974 Livab was absorbed into Volvo BM.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tandem</b> scrapers: {{separate}} <b>tractor</b> and scraper engines {{provide better}} traction in steep or slippery areas; a push cat is required except when loading loose materials.|$|R
2500|$|The Boulton & Paul P.12 Bodmin was an {{experimental}} British twin-engined biplane bomber with its engines mounted in a fuselage engine room and with <b>tandem</b> pairs of <b>tractor</b> and pusher airscrews mounted between the wings. [...] The two Bodmins built flew successfully in 1924, proving the concept, but the layout was not developed to production.|$|R
500|$|There is one {{exception}} to the formula: two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry [...] each if the overall distance {{between the first and}} last axles of these tandems is [...] or more. For example, a five-axle truck may carry 34,000pounds both on the <b>tractor</b> <b>tandem</b> axles (2 and 3) and the trailer tandem axles (4 and 5), provided axles 2 and 5 are spaced at least [...] apart.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of closed}} wings in {{aircraft}} has been explored {{many times in}} the past. The oldest known implementation of the surface was the Blériot III aircraft, built in 1906 by Louis Blériot and Gabriel Voisin. The aircraft's lifting structure consisted of two annular wings mounted in <b>tandem,</b> with two <b>tractor</b> propellers powered by an engine mounted inside the diameter of the forward wing. The Blériot IV was a variation on this design, which replaced the forward annular wing with a canard biplane setup similar to the 1903 Wright Flyer. This aircraft was able to leave the ground in a series of small hops before being damaged beyond repair.|$|R
