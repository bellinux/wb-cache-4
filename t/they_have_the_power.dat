5|$|Within {{their limited}} jurisdictions, {{municipalities}} are autonomous, responsible and accountable to their citizens, to the province and their future {{residents in the}} case for the unpopulated Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort Municipality. Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws.

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E

50|$|La Forest {{began by}} {{considering}} {{the question of whether}} the Canadian Charter applied to municipalities. He found that it did as they were government entities. He noted that municipalities were run by elected officials and were accountable to <b>the</b> public, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to collect taxes, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to make laws which they derived from the provincial government. In addressing the municipality's argument that the residency requirement was merely a private employment contract and not a governmental function, La Forest J. found that once a body is labeled governmental, that body cannot use colourable devices or organize activities to avoid Charter responsibility.|$|R

500|$|In {{the second}} part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under {{the more radical}} {{influence}} of Zawahiri and his rich Saudi acolyte Osama bin Laden, join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [...] "Evil Empire's" [...] defeat. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union {{was on the verge}} of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manner in}} which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators {{interact}} is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers {{can be seen as}} being in a privileged position, whereby <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to alter the patients' quality of life. And yet, there are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise. Effects stemming from a [...] "gender gap" [...] between nurses and doctors are detrimental to the professional environment of a hospital workspace.|$|E

2500|$|The Fourteen Infallibles ( [...] Ma‘sūmūn) ( [...] Chahar'dah Ma‘sūm) in Twelver Shia Islam are the Islamic prophet Muhammad, his {{daughter}} Fatima Zahra; and the Twelve Imams. All {{are considered to}} be infallible under the theological concept of Ismah. Accordingly, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to commit sin but by their nature are able to avoid doing so, which is regarded as a miraculous gift from God. The Infallibles are believed to follow only God's desire in their actions because of their supreme righteousness, consciousness, and love for God. They are also regarded as being immune to error in practical matters, in calling people to religion, and in the perception of divine knowledge. Shias believe the Fourteen Infallibles are superior to the rest of creation and to the other major prophets.|$|E

2500|$|According to [...] Shaktisamgama Tantra, {{the spouse}} of Kali is {{extremely}} frightening.

He is adorned with eight skulls, seated on five corpses, holds a trident, a drum, a sword and a scythe in his hands. He is adorned with ashes from the cremation ground and surrounded by numbers of loudly shrieking vultures and jackals. Among his side is his consort Kali and they both represent the flow of time. Both Mahakala and Kali/Mahakali represent the ultimate destructive power of Brahman and they are not bounded by any rules or regulations. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to dissolve even time and space into themselves and exist as Void at the dissolution of the universe. They are responsible for the dissolution of the universe at the end of Kalpa. They are also responsible for annihilating great evils and great daemons when other gods, Devas and even Trimurtis fail to do so. Mahakala and Kali annihilates men, women, children, animals, the [...] world and the entire universe without mercy because they are Kala or Time in the personified form and Time is not bound by anything and Time does not show mercy, nor does it wait for anything or anyone.|$|E

Then comes the question whether or no the bill will be fairly paid--whether they who have spent the money will set about that disagreeable task of settling the account with a true purpose and an honest energy.
