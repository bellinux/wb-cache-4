5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of pieces. A move is completed only when <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> pressed. Touch move is practiced {{to a lesser}} extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> in Thailand <b>was</b> not in colour until 1974. Originally <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tower in Bangkok {{in black and}} white. In 1974 <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> yellow on blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculations}} for <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> made {{up until}} 1928, {{after which they}} were supervised by the astronomer Professor Elis Strömgren. The drawings for <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> made between 1934 and 1936, and the actual production of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> took place from 1943 until 1955. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> started on 15 December 1955 by King Frederick IX and Jens Olsen's youngest grandchild Birgit.|$|R
50|$|The {{city hall}} {{building}} that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> built for {{came to an}} end in 1961. In the 1980s parts of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>were</b> moved to <b>the</b> Edmonton Court of Portage Place mall. The faces and hands of <b>the</b> current <b>clock</b> <b>are</b> replicas of <b>the</b> originals. The bells are not from <b>the</b> 1903 <b>clock,</b> and <b>the</b> chimes <b>are</b> now electronic. At the Portage Place location <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> inoperable {{for a number of years}} due to damage from a contractor and later due to damage from a member of the public.|$|R
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

50|$|Sometime after 1670, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} from verge escapement and foliot to a pendulum. For <b>the</b> conversion, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> turned upside-down {{and the release}} mechanism for the hour strike was adapted to the new positioning of <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|R
50|$|In May 2014, the {{historic}} Water Tower <b>Clock</b> <b>was</b> installed in <b>the</b> concourse of <b>the</b> station. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> had originally <b>been</b> erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite {{the end of}} Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about 60 ft high. In 1902 <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> moved to Princes Bridge station, and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed {{as part of the}} station's redevelopment in <b>the</b> mid-1960s. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> mechanism <b>was</b> given to Museum Victoria, but the characteristic turret that housed <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> sold to a scrap metal merchant. It was later rescued by private collectors, and <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the Scienceworks Museum, Spotswood. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} and calculated by Jens Olsen {{who was a}} skilled locksmith, but later learned the trade of clockmaking. He also {{took part in the}} beginning of <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> construction, but died in 1945, 10 years before <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> one of Weymouth's best-loved {{landmarks}} and {{has been}} a meeting place for generations of both locals and visitors. It is the focal point of Weymouth's New Year's Eve celebrations as midnight approaches and revelers gather beneath its four faces to welcome in the New Year.|$|E
25|$|Constructed {{over one}} hundred years ago, the clock {{on top of the}} main head house is the largest {{operating}} hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> styled after London's Big Ben, and has a 12-foot wide face. The mechanism weighs over 400 pounds. In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark of a bygone era—something that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> eight feet wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings.|$|E
25|$|In Martin Scorsese's 2011 film Hugo, {{a portion}} of the scene with Lloyd hanging from <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> shown when the main {{characters}} sneak into a movie theater. Later, the title character Hugo similarly hangs from the hands of a large clock on a clock tower to escape a pursuer.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> name <b>is</b> unknown. One myth <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> meant to commemorate Ohio's {{admission}} to the Union as the 17th state because the shield {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> case has seventeen stars in it. However, there is no record that shows <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> celebrates Ohio's statehood and <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> ordered twelve years after Ohio became a state, {{at a time when there}} were already eighteen states.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> {{mechanism}} <b>was</b> {{built by}} E. Howard & Co. and was originally weight-driven, requiring staff to [...] "wind" [...] <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> frequently. As electricity became prevalent, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> converted {{to use an}} electric motor, {{making it easier to}} maintain and more accurate. Most of <b>the</b> original <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> preserved during this upgrade.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} timing racing pigeons involves rubber rings with unique identification numbers and {{a specially designed}} pigeon racing clock. The ring is attached around the bird's leg before being sent to race. The serial number is recorded, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> set and sealed, and the bird carries the ring home.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} bird returns, its trainer removes {{the ring and}} places it in a slot in the clock. The time that the ring was placed in <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> {{recorded}} as the official time that the competing bird arrived home. From this timestamp an average speed is measured and a winner of the race can be found.|$|E
25|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> a gilt copper sphere, a {{time ball}} that rises up a mast every hour and {{falls on the}} hour. The {{mechanism}} {{was taken out of}} use for many years because of noise complaints from local residents: it was renewed as part of a renovation of the clock tower and surrounding area in 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> made by Joseph Knibb in 1670 and {{installed}} in the college in 1671. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> face <b>is</b> still in its original location over the west door of the college chapel. <b>The</b> 1670 <b>clock</b> mechanism <b>is</b> now kept in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> in <b>the</b> {{center of}} the concourse, sold by earlier owners, was located in Chicago in 2003. In late 2004, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} for $25,000 through fundraising organized by WBEN and a donation from M&T Bank. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{on display in the}} Terminal during the 2005 event season. In the fall of 2005, it was relocated to the lobby of M&T Center in downtown Buffalo, where it remained until spring of 2009. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> then moved back to its original location in the Terminal concourse where it will sit permanently on public display.|$|R
50|$|In 1790, the old {{bell tower}} 'on the ditch {{of the close}} of the canons of the said church' {{mentioned}} in the deed of 1386 which had housed <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> demolished, so <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> moved to <b>the</b> Cathedral's central tower. In 1884, a new <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> installed and <b>the</b> old one was left to the side.|$|R
25|$|A {{standard}} adult bandy match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break. The end of the match is known as full-time.|$|E
25|$|If {{the scores}} are {{identical}} {{at the end}} of the match, the contest is resolved by the Golden Score rule. Golden Score is a sudden death situation where <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> reset to match-time, and the first contestant to achieve any score wins. If there is no score during this period, then the winner is decided by , the majority opinion of the referee and the two corner judges.|$|E
25|$|This {{shows that}} the time (Δt′) between the two ticks {{as seen in the}} frame in which <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> moving (S′), is longer than the time (Δt) between these ticks as {{measured}} in the rest frame of the clock (S). Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of muons produced by cosmic rays impinging on the Earth's atmosphere is measured to be greater than the lifetimes of muons measured in the laboratory.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> station <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} {{installed in}} the early 1900s and is clearly seen on a 1912 photograph, with an identical clock noted on a 1905 photograph of once nearby Turton Station. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> has a London Midland Scottish Railway (LMSR) identity number, an oval brass disc nailed onto <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> long case (LMS 9994), this number indicating that <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> installed by <b>the</b> L&YR before {{the creation of the}} LMS in 1923. In 1996 <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> restored to working order by the Railway Heritage Trust.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> quartz <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} in {{a stylish}} grey Cycolac resin case, {{because of the}} size and complexities of <b>the</b> movement <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> quite large and weighed in at over 1 kilo.|$|R

25|$|The Clock Block is {{connected}} to the Perrins Hall and was built in 1927, and had extension work carried out in 1967 to link it to the Science Block. It has a bell tower and clock above the entrance. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> made of Cotswold Limestone, and is surmounted by the carved head of Old Father Time. To commemorate the millennium a stained glass window was commissioned and installed over the main entrance to the Clock Block.|$|E
25|$|The Mausoleum of James Thomas Law (1790–1876) {{chancellor}} of the Lichfield diocese is built at {{the northern edge of}} the churchyard. Initially built for his wife who died in 1864, it resembles a canopied medieval tomb. The structure was surmounted by a clock with two dials which were illuminated at night by gas. Built {{on the side of the}} Trent Valley Road it served as a reminder of the time to travellers on their way to the station. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> now missing and the mausoleum is overgrown with vegetation. The Mausoleum is a Grade II Listed Building.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} a leap second event, ntpd {{receives}} notification {{from either}} a configuration file, an attached reference clock, or a remote server. Because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing, a leap second is inserted with the sequence 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00. Although <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> actually halted during the event, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should ever become necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to working condition in 1907.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{built and}} {{operational}} by 1855. It was constructed by Brother Bernardin (1812−1876) of the Community of Brothers of The Mother House of the Brothers of Ploërmel. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> originally inside <b>the</b> monastic building {{it is now}} displayed in a kiosk in the interior court of the cloisters.|$|R
50|$|In March 2016, {{the visitor}} center {{unveiled}} the new location of <b>the</b> iconic countdown <b>clock</b> at <b>the</b> complex's entrance; previously, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> located with a flagpole at the press site. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the National Register of Historic Places in January 2000.|$|R
