5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Grove {{played two}} {{games for the}} White Sox, {{pitching}} seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings. He spent {{the start of the}} 1941 season at Oklahoma City, though on May 19 he was sent to the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League, where he {{spent the rest of the}} season. Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} screened for the producers in October 1926, {{but they did}} not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of the film and decided to shelve it. However, due to the runaway success of , which was released in February 1927, the producers decided to release The Mountain Eagle three months later on 23 May 1927. The film was reportedly released in the United States as Fear o' God, but the title on the surviving US lobby card seems to contradict this. Film historian J. Larry Kuhns claims that the film was never released under that title.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, {{largely as a result of}} Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E

25|$|Adding in Usagi's {{child to}} the Sailor Moon storyline, {{as well as her}} name, Chibiusa for a chibi (little) Usagi, was the idea of Naoko Takeuchi's editor, Fumio Osano.

25|$|Marianne Dashwood – the romantically {{inclined}} and eagerly expressive second {{daughter of}} Mr and Mrs Henry Dashwood. She is 16 {{years old at}} the beginning of the book.

She is attracted to young, handsome, romantically spirited Willoughby and does not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of the older, more reserved Colonel Brandon. Marianne undergoes the most development within the book, learning her sensibilities have been selfish. She decides her conduct should be more like that of her elder sister, Elinor.|$|E

The EP was recorded and produced in Dublin and contains seven tracks spanning approximately 26 minutes. i think you <b>think</b> too <b>much</b> of me {{is the first of}} Ng's works to be released on physical media, as it was produced in two 12-inch vinyl formats, clear red and clear, in addition to Compact Cassette.|$|R

25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} <b>think</b> <b>much</b> about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. But then when the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t <b>think</b> <b>much</b> of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How I Learned to Live with the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E

This {{was a crucial}} decision for he led the First Company of the Gabonese Army, {{the company of the}} other officers.

[...] Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans, therefore, {{except to say that}} she was impressed by their public education system.|$|E

500|$|... "The Battle" [...] {{aired in}} {{broadcast}} syndication {{during the week}} commencing November 15, 1987. It received Nielsen ratings of 10.5, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot.

Staff writer Maurice Hurley later said that the episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] because {{of the performance of}} Patrick Stewart.

500|$|Desha {{was elected}} without {{opposition}} to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1807. Though {{he was known as}} a capable orator, he did not speak often, claiming it was best [...] "to <b>think</b> <b>much</b> and speak but little." [...] He opposed renewing the charter of the First Bank of the United States because most of the bank's investors were foreigners. Specifically, he was concerned about the fact King George III of Great Britain was a major shareholder. (It was thought by many that the British monarch {{was on the verge of}} madness at this time.) The bank's charter ultimately was not renewed in 1811.|$|E
