5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. <b>The</b> <b>injuries</b> were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} caveat of the astrocytic {{response to}} CNS injuries is its heterogeneity. Particularly, {{the response of}} the astrocytes to <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> varies depending on factors such as the nature of <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> and <b>the</b> microenvironment at <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> location. Further, <b>the</b> reactive astrocytes in the immediate vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> increase gene expression, thus compounding the response of other astrocytes and contributing to the heterogeneity. Particularly, astrocytes closest to the lesion generally secrete more inhibitory molecules into the extracellular matrix.|$|R

Paulet effected repairs to both ships and gave temporary command of Gloire to Lieutenant John Talbot, who was subsequently promoted.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of small {{intestine}} injury resulting from suprapubic catheter insertion. This case {{is of particular interest}} for three reasons.

5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop.

Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again. The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season.|$|E

50|$|Because {{there are}} so many factors that {{contribute}} to {{the success or failure of}} neural tissue engineering, there are many difficulties that arise in using neural tissue engineering to treat CNS and PNS <b>injuries.</b> First, <b>the</b> therapy needs to be delivered to the site of <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> This means that <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site needs to be accessed by surgery or drug delivery. Both of these methods have inherent risks and difficulties in themselves, compounding the problems associated with the treatments. A second concern is keeping the therapy at the site of <b>the</b> <b>injury.</b> Stem cells have a tendency to migrate out of <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site to other sections of the brain, thus the therapy is not as effective as it could be as when the cells stay at <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> site. Additionally, <b>the</b> delivery of stem cells and other morphogens to <b>the</b> site of <b>injury</b> can cause more harm than good if they induce tumorigenesis, inflammation, or other unforeseen effects. Finally, the findings in laboratories may not translate to practical clinical treatments. Treatments are successful in a lab, or even an animal model of <b>the</b> <b>injury,</b> may not be effective in a human patient.|$|R
