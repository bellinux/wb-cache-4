25|$|The ETF <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is the {{difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which is {{the difference}} between the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX futures market.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe digital {{television}} signal is a promising signal {{of opportunity for}} ubiquitous wireless positioning. This letter analyzes the time of arrival (TOA) <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> of the European standard digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) signals {{in the context of}} positioning. The Cramér-Rao lower bound on the unsmoothed TOA estimation is derived and an information-theoretic lower bound (ITLB) is further computed on the smoothed TOA <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> in delay locked loop (DLL). Theoretical analysis shows that, the increase of the bandwidth of the equivalent loop filter will lead to larger DLL <b>tracking</b> <b>errors.</b> Despite different bandwidth of the loop filters, the <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> derived in theory are asymptotic to ITLB with the increase of signal-noise ratio. Comparatively, the theoretical results of the DLL <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> are slightly larger than the ITLB, which is due to the inequality and nonlinear approximation used in the analysis. Theoretical analysis has also verified the effectiveness of the DVB-T signals to be able to achieve high accuracy in positioning...|$|R

We find that <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> are {{significantly different from}} zero and display persistence. Based on Jensen's alpha, risk adjusted returns are significantly inferior to benchmark returns for all ETFs with two exceptions at conventional significance levels revealing that passive investment strategy does not outperform market returns. We then examine {{the degree to which}} frequently used factors such as expense ratio, dividends, exchange rate and spreads of trading prices may be underlying sources of <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> causing this underperformance. We find that the change in the exchange rate is a significant source of <b>tracking</b> <b>errors.</b> Our serial correlation test, runs test and panel regression analysis reveal that Asian markets display relatively greater persistence and therefore are less efficient in disseminating information and noisier in filtering the information contained in returns.

2500|$|An {{example that}} has both hedge and {{speculative}} notions involves {{a mutual fund}} or separately managed account whose investment objective is to track {{the performance of a}} stock index such as the S 500 stock index. The Portfolio manager often [...] "equitizes" [...] cash inflows in an easy and cost effective manner by investing in (opening long) S 500 stock index futures. This gains the portfolio exposure to the index which is consistent with the fund or account investment objective without having to buy an appropriate proportion of each of the individual 500 stocks just yet. This also preserves balanced diversification, maintains a higher degree of the percent of assets invested in the market and helps reduce <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> in the performance of the fund/account. When it is economically feasible (an efficient amount of shares of every individual position within the fund or account can be purchased), the portfolio manager can close the contract and make purchases of each individual stock.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate methods to improve the ability to maintain the inventory of orbital elements of Earth satellites during periods of atmospheric disturbance brought on by severe solar activity. Existing techniques do not account for such atmospheric dynamics, resulting in <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> of several seconds in predicted crossing time. Two techniques are examined to reduce of these <b>tracking</b> <b>errors.</b> First, density predicted from various atmospheric models is fit to the orbital decay rate {{for a number of}} satellites. An orbital decay model is then developed {{that could be used to}} reduce <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> by accounting for atmospheric changes. The second approach utilizes a Kalman filter to estimate the orbital decay rate of a satellite after every observation. The new information is used to predict the next observation. Results from the first approach demonstrated the feasibility of building an orbital decay model based on predicted atmospheric density. Correlation of atmospheric density to orbital decay was as high as 0. 88. However, it is clear that contemporary: atmospheric models need further improvement in modeling density perturbations polar region brought on by solar activity. The second approach resulted in a dramatic reduction in <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> for certain satellites during severe solar Storms. For example, in the limited cases studied, the reduction in <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> ranged from 79 to 25 percent...|$|R
40|$|A {{tracking}} control methodology via time-varying state feedback {{based on the}} backstepping technique is proposed for both a kinematic and simplified dynamic model of a two-degrees-of-freedom mobile robot. We first address the local tracking problem where initial <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> are sufficiently small. Then, under additional conditions on the desired velocities, we treat the global tracking problem where initial <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> are arbitrary.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust backstepping control (BC) methodbased on nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) {{for trajectory tracking}} of the nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) {{in the presence of}} external disturbances and parameters uncertainties. At first, a bounded Fuzzy logic based backstepping controller (BFLBC) is designed to control the WMR without considering the effects of the external disturbances and the parameters uncertainties. Typically, the conventional BC controller depends upon the state <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> analysis, where unbounded velocity signal is produced for the applications that have huge <b>tracking</b> <b>errors.</b> Therefore, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is introduced in this research in order to normalize the state <b>tracking</b> <b>errors,</b> so that the input errors to the BC are bounded to a finite interval. Finally, the designed BFLBC is integrated with the nonlinear disturbance observer in order to attenuate the external disturbances and model uncertainties. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller to generate a bounded velocity signal as well as to stabilize the <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> to zero. In addition, the results prove that the proposed controller provide an excellent disturbance attenuation as well as robustness against the parameters uncertainties...|$|R
5000|$|If <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is {{measured}} historically, {{it is called}} 'realized' or 'ex post' <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> If a model is used to predict <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> it is called 'ex ante' <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> Ex-post <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is more useful for reporting performance, whereas ex-ante <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is generally used by portfolio managers to control risk. Various types of ex-ante <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> models exist, from simple equity models which use beta as a primary determinant to more complicated multi-factor fixed income models. In a factor model of a portfolio, the non-systematic risk (i.e., the standard deviation of the residuals) is called [...] "tracking error" [...] in the investment field. The latter way to compute the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> complements the formulas below but results can vary (sometimes {{by a factor of}} 2).|$|E
50|$|Within passive {{portfolio}} management, {{the absolute}} value of the relative return is often called the <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> which is confusing since the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> is more generally defined as the standard deviation of the relative return.

5000|$|Many {{portfolios}} {{are managed}} to a benchmark, typically an index. Some portfolios {{are expected to}} replicate, before trading and other costs, the returns of an index exactly (e.g., an index fund), while others are expected to 'actively manage' the portfolio by deviating slightly from the index in order to generate active returns. <b>Tracking</b> <b>error</b> {{is a measure of}} the deviation from the benchmark; the aforementioned index fund would have a <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> close to zero, while an actively managed portfolio would normally have a higher <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> Thus the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> does not include any risk (return) that is merely a function of the market's movement. In addition to risk (return) from specific stock selection or industry and factor [...] "bets," [...] it can also include risk (return) from market timing decisions.|$|E

40|$|A new Tropical Cyclone (TC) {{surface wind}} speed {{probability}} product from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{takes into account}} uncertainty in track, maximum wind speed, and wind radii. A Monte Carlo (MC) model is used that draws from probability distributions based on historic <b>track</b> <b>errors.</b> In this thesis, distributions of forecast <b>track</b> <b>errors</b> conditioned on forecast confidence are examined to determine if significant differences exist in distribution characteristics. Two predictors are used to define forecast confidence: the Goerss Predicted Consensus Error (GPCE) and the Global Forecast System (GFS) ensemble spread. The distributions of total-, along-, and crosstrack errors from NHC official forecasts are defined for low, average, and high forecast confidence. Also, distributions of the GFS ensemble mean total-track errors are defined based on similar confidence levels. Standard hypothesis testing methods are used to examine distribution characteristics. Using the GPCE values, significant differences in nearly all <b>track</b> <b>error</b> distributions existed for each level of forecast confidence. The GFS ensemble spread did not {{provide a basis for}} statistically different distributions.

A trajectory preprocessor, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, feedforward controller, and their combination were designed, built, analyzed, and tested. The antenna exhibits nonlinear behavior when the input to the antenna and/or the derivative of this input exceeds the imposed limits; for slewing and acquisition commands, these limits are typically violated. A trajectory preprocessor was designed {{to ensure that the}} antenna behaves linearly, just to prevent nonlinear limit cycling. The estimator model for the LQG controller was identified from the data obtained from the field test. Based on an LQG balanced representation, a reduced-order LQG controller was obtained. The feedforward controller and the combination of the LQG and feedforward controller were also investigated. The performance of the controllers was evaluated with the <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> (due to following a trajectory) and the disturbance errors (due to the disturbances acting on the antenna).
