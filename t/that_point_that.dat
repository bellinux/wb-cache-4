With no takers, he renewed the offer in 1924, when aviation technology had advanced enough at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> many people tried for the prize. Most were attempting to fly from New York to Paris, {{but a number of}} French aviators planned an attempt to fly in the opposite direction, from Paris to New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{became known}} to Western scholars {{as a result}} of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The Codex's relationship to the Latin Vulgate was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of the Codex's value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It was at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Textus Receptus.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be a}} monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.|$|E
5|$|With Attu Island secure, the Americans {{diverted}} {{their attention}} towards forcing the Japanese off Kiska. U.S. intelligence estimated at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{the number of}} Japanese troops on Kiska {{was likely to be}} 10,000, so Kinkaid deployed 34,426 men, composed of both Americans and Canadians, to the Aleutians to work on recapturing Kiska. With the recapturing operation scheduled to begin on August 15, the Eleventh Air Force dropped 424 tons of bombs on Kiska during the month of July. In addition, the Navy fired 330 tons of shells onto the island during the same period. In late July, the pilots charged with scouting for enemy forces on Kiska reported a sharp decline in the amount of fire received by their planes from Japanese forces on the ground. The Americans believed that one of two events had occurred – either Kiska had been evacuated, or the Japanese had retreated into the hills of Kiska.|$|E

25|$|A raid {{was planned}} on Lausanne, the canton's capital, for 1 May, but faltered {{due to a}} misunderstanding: part of the insurgents {{believed}} they were to assemble on 30 April for a raid on the 1st, while others thought they were to assemble on the 1st. Finding their numbers too low {{on the morning of}} the 1st, the crowd dispersed peacefully. They started regrouping in the countryside near Lausanne over the following days, though. According to the historian Eugène Monod, it is only at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the captain Louis Reymond, who had been active in the 1798 uprisings, was made the visible leader of the movement.|$|E
25|$|Drums in the Night (Trommeln in der Nacht) is a {{play by the}} German playwright Bertolt Brecht. Brecht {{wrote it}} between 1919 and 1920, and it {{received}} its first theatrical production in 1922. It is in the expressionist style of Ernst Toller and Georg Kaiser. The play—along with Baal and In the Jungle—won the Kleist Prize for 1922 (although it was widely assumed, perhaps because Drums was the only play of the three to have been produced at <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> the prize had been awarded to Drums alone); the play was performed all over Germany as a result. Brecht later claimed that he had only written it {{as a source of}} income.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} the WTUL also began to work for {{legislative}} reforms, in particular the eight-hour day, the minimum wage and protective legislation. Because of the hostility of the United States Supreme Court toward economic legislation at the time, only legislation that singled out women and children for special protections survived challenges to its constitutionality. Ironically, Samuel Gompers and the conservative leadership of the AFL also viewed such legislation with hostility, but for a different reason: they believed by <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> legislation of this sort interfered with collective bargaining, both by usurping the role of unions in obtaining better wages and working conditions and in setting a precedent for governmental intrusion into the area.|$|E
25|$|A central {{feature of}} honing theory {{is the notion}} of a {{potentiality}} state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.|$|E
