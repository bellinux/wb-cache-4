5|$|The {{number of}} subplots {{on the show}} grew as more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a {{variation}} of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s), the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life, Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers, Smiler {{trying to find a}} woman, Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda), and Tom <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{one step ahead of the}} repo man.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E
25|$|The first mass {{exodus of}} German civilians {{from the eastern}} territories was {{composed}} of both spontaneous flight and organised evacuation, starting in mid-1944 and continuing until early 1945. Conditions turned chaotic during the winter, when kilometres-long queues of refugees pushed their carts through the snow <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> ahead of the advancing Red Army.|$|E

25|$|While not {{the fastest}} car all week, the #11 Castrol Holden VR Commodore {{was close to}} the front in most sessions, and the race looked like being a battle between Wayne Gardner, Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton and the Perkins car. At the start, a minor {{collision}} between Perkins and Lowndes saw the tyre valve from Perkins front right wheel torn off, resulting in the deflation of the tyre, and a slow lap back around to the pits. After replacing the tyre, and checking for other damage, Perkins roared down pit lane, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the lead lap, a feat he accomplished.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{the team}} {{revealed}} {{the first piece}} of concept art for the protagonists, created by artist Ryan Jones and based on actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who allowed their likenesses to be used for the in-game characters. Season designer and writer Michael Stemmle emphasized that the game's graphics would take a less realistic and more stylized approach while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> true to the feel of the trilogy. The puzzles were designed to rely on applying items in the inventory to characters and objects as the developers did not think of Marty as a protagonist that would build a gadget from various parts.|$|E
25|$|Although Alexander was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right, he worked to avoid this and ultimately did not face a high-profile challenger. He declared his intention to run early, quickly won the endorsement of Governor Bill Haslam, every living former Tennessee Republican Party Chairman and the state's entire Republican congressional delegation (except scandal-hit Scott DesJarlais). He also raised {{a large amount of}} money and worked to avoid the mistakes of ousted Senators Bob Bennett and Richard Lugar by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in touch with his constituents, especially in East Tennessee. Moreover, out-of-state conservative organizations such as the Senate Conservatives Fund made little effort to defeat Alexander.|$|E

25|$|King {{penguins}} and emperor penguins also do {{not build}} nests; instead, they tuck their eggs and chicks between their feet and folds of skin on their lower bellies. They are thus able to move about while incubating, though in practice only the emperor penguin regularly does so. Emperor penguins breed during the harshest months of the Antarctic winter, and their mobility allows them to form huge huddled masses which help them to withstand the extremely high winds and low temperatures of the season. Without the ability to share body heat (temperatures in the centre of tight groups can {{be as much as}} 10C above the ambient air temperature), the penguins would expend far more energy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> warm, and breeding attempts would probably fail.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the naval}} combat mini-game goes into {{attempting}} to outmaneuver the enemy, bringing the enemy vessel into cannon range while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out of the enemy's line of fire. The player may also attempt to board the enemy {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid harm to his ship or the target. Wind direction and specific ship capabilities feature heavily into this. Some ships are adept at sailing at sharp angles to the wind direction, while others can only gain reasonable speed while sailing across or with the wind. Turning speed is also different between ship types, and so some ships can actually weave between cannonballs, while others turn very slowly and cannot make fancy maneuvers. There is great emphasis on knowing the particular strengths and weaknesses of one's ship, and the ability to gauge wind direction continuously and act accordingly.|$|E
25|$|At Watkins Glen, Gordon was {{dominating}} the second road course {{race of the}} season when the telemetry box in his car used by NBC Sports burst into flames, injuring a crew member and ending the 31's day. In spite of struggles, it was announced in November 2001 that Gordon would drive the car full-time the next year. In the rescheduled season finale at New Hampshire, Robby Gordon was engaged in a closing-laps battle with eventual champion Jeff Gordon (no relation). With 16 laps to go, leader Jeff Gordon (who ended up leading 257 of the 300 laps) was stuck behind the 12th place No. 77 car of Robert Pressley <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the lead lap, with Robby right on his tail. In the middle of turns 3 and four, Robby gave a bump to Jeff while he had slowed down to try and pass the lapped car of Mike Wallace, sending him into Wallace's No. 12 car and inflicting damage on the 24 car. Jeff was black flagged while attempting to retaliate under caution, and Robby went on to earn a controversial first career victory. It was also the 31 car's first victory.|$|E

Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup.

500|$|The {{development}} team decided that, as with And Then There Were None, {{they would}} change Christie's original ending for Murder on the Orient Express. The {{aim of the}} developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read Murder on the Orient Express, and know the solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions [...] one being {{what appears to be}} happening and the other being what is actually occurring [...] and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of And Then There Were None received some criticism, and said that in Murder on the Orient Express changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame of the book and its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said that he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode".

Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual).

It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums.
