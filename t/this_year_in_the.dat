5|$|During this season, {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone formed on March 16, {{and the last}} one dissipated on December 12. A total of 29 tropical depressions formed <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Pacific, of which 25 became tropical storms. 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. Two-thirds of the tropical cyclones formed between July and October. Typhoon Pamela was the longest-lived tropical cyclone of the season. Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles, with eight moving through the Philippines. Tropical cyclones accounted for 35percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong, their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time. Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy moving through the Philippines and Vietnam in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} Thursday, 22 April, United hosted their longtime rivals, Red Bull New York. Broadcast on ESPN2, it was United's first televised {{match on}} the network <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 12th minute of play, a Luke Rodgers cross to Red Bulls striker, Thierry Henry led to the first goal for New York. Henry scored his third goal of the season, and {{the second of the}} match in the 38th minute of play, doubling New York's lead. Heading into halftime, Olsen replaced club captain, McCarty in for DP, Branko Bošković at halftime. Bošković, praised for his play in the match, had two shots on goal that were deflected off of the crossbar. In the 64th minute, Bošković sent a free kick hurdling towards the upper right post, only to be denied by the crossbar. Throughout a majority of the second half United dominated the Red Bulls in possession, but failed time and time again to score. A counterattack in the 72nd minute, led by Estonian international, Joel Lindpere gave New York a 3–0 advantage over United. Subsequently, Bošković had his third shot on goal deflect off the bar. American prospect, Juan Agudelo netted in injury time for the Red Bulls, giving the club a 4–0 win over United. The loss for United was their worst ever home loss against New York, and their worst loss at home since 2005, when the team lost 4–0 to Chicago Fire in an MLS Cup quarterfinal leg.|$|E

25|$|During {{this year}} on the Asian continent, the several {{divisions}} of the old Mongol Empire were {{in a state of}} gradual decline. The Ilkhanate had already fragmented into several kingdoms struggling to place their puppet emperors over the shell of an old state. The Chagatai Khanate {{was in the midst of}} a civil war and one year from falling to rebellion. The Golden Horde to the north was besieging Genoese colonies along the coast of the Black Sea, and the Yuan dynasty in China was seeing the first seeds of a resistance which would lead to its downfall. Southeast Asia remained free from Mongol power, with several small kingdoms struggling for survival. The Siamese dynasty in that area vanquished the Sukhothai in <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian Archipelago, the Majapahit Empire was in the midst of a golden age under the leadership of Gajah Mada, who remains a famous figure in Indonesia.|$|E

The Holy Roman Empire under Louis IV took control of Holland and the {{surrounding}} area, granting these lands to his wife Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut in a move which angered many of his princes. Holland was also in the midst of the Friso-Hollandic Wars, engaging with the Frisians on 26 September in the Battle of Warns. Italy, which at the time was divided into several kingdoms, saw several power struggles including the Battle of Gamenario in the north, and the assassination of Andrew, Duke of Calabria in the Kingdom of Naples. In Northern Europe, Swedes continued early stages of their emigration to Estonia, which would continue in the coming decades. Estonian rulers also managed to crush the St. George's Night Uprising in 1345 after a two-year struggle. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania changed hands from Jaunutis to his brother Algirdas in a relatively bloodless shift of power, and Lithuania continued its skirmishes with its northern, Estonian neighbor.|$|E
