There is no study assessing workload of functional medical doctors (general practioners) at primary health centers in Bali. The objective {{of this study were}} to describe functional medical doctors workload, the number and distribution which is needed in primary health centers in Denpasar. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among functional medical doctors at 11 primary health centers across Denpasar. Data were collected by interview and participatory observation to the study participans. Data was analyzed using WISN English Version 1. 1. 132. 0 software. Results: Among 34 study participans, majority were female (73. 5 %), aged 35 - 44 years (61. 8 %), working as a government employe (97. 1 %), with tenure of 6 - 10 years (55. 9 %) and almost all of them (95. 6 %) had additional duties besides providing medical care to patients. Results indicated that workload of functional medical doctors at primary health centers was high with WISN ratio 0. 5 - 0. 9 compared to the ideal ratio= 1.

In many situations to solve this problem it is necessary to use the operations research methods. Objectives: This paper proposes a new methodology for vendor {{selection and}} determination of supplied quotas. The work investigates the problem of flour purchase by a company that manufactures bakery products. Methods/Approach: The problem is solved by using the model that combines a revised weighting method, and a multiple objective programming method based on game theory. The revised weighting method is used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the objective function coefficients, and a multiple objective programming method is used to select vendors and <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> supply <b>quotas</b> from the selected vendors. For selection of vendors and determination of quantities supplied by individual vendors three complex criteria are used: (1) purchasing costs, (2) product quality, and (3) vendor reliability. Results: The proposed methodology has numerous strengths, such as an efficient reduction of complex criteria functions to simple ones and efficient using of a new multiple objective programming methods based on cooperative game theory.

30|$|Adopting {{national}} incentive {{programs will}} stimulate {{the demand for}} urban EVs. Incentives schemes may have many forms such as government tax credits, emission regulations, policy legislation and fuel economy standards. US, Japan, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Singapore have adopted policies to support {{the development of the}} new energy vehicles industry for years. Financial policies usually include government rebates of $ 3000 to $ 10000 to each EV car owner (10 % of vehicle price). In Netherlands, the rebates reach 30 % of the vehicle price [2, 28]. These government refunds will make EVs less expensive to buy than comparable ICEVs. Implementing regulations that limit vehicle exhaust emissions is another form of governments’ support to EVs. A European Union regulation requires reduction of average fleet emissions. Likewise, California’s zero emissions vehicle regulation requires explicitly introduction of alternative fuel vehicles. On the other hand, fuel-economy standards are a major driving force behind using high energy efficiency EVs. Countries without regulations, like Middle East, India and Russia, suffer from very low fuel economy improvements. In contrast, there are significant fuel-efficiency improvements in the US, Europe, China and Japan [29]. Other incentives might include obliging public fleet operators <b>to</b> adopt a <b>determined</b> <b>quota</b> of urban EVs. The governments could also adopt appropriate city transport planning that takes into consideration the requirements of urban EVs regarding infrastructure and space.|$|R

In the relatively open habitats of the rangelands, conspicuous animals such as kangaroos are amenable to aerial survey. Other survey methods such as direct counts from vehicles or indirect monitoring such as harvest statistics, including catch per unit effort or harvest sex ratio, are restricted in their potential survey frequency and extent due to cost and also vary in their reliability. Kangaroo monitoring programs have several characteristics that make them attractive for monitoring biological diversity in the rangelands. These include systematic design, standardised methods, annual surveys and strong political and bureaucratic support. Other species such as emus and bustards, and feral herbivores such as goats are also counted during aerial surveys, allowing patterns of distribution and trends in their abundance <b>to</b> be <b>determined.</b> Through correlation with rainfall, long-term data for all these species have provided an understanding of their population dynamics. This is valuable, as trend monitoring will be complicated by process error in fluctuating environments. Comparisons of large herbivore population dynamics between areas allows an assessment of varying environmental impacts such as drought, effects of different management regimes such as harvesting and National Park management, and longer-term environmental change.

40|$|Over the years, traffic {{congestion}} {{has become an}} ever more serious issue in many mega-regions worldwide, and has caused huge economic and environmental loss. Having witnessed big increase in the sales of passenger cars, some authorities have turned to vehicle ownership quota policy, which is a direct tool to control the number of vehicles on the road. Two of the most typical ownership quota policies, are the vehicle plate lottery system and vehicle plate auction system. This thesis developed an analytical framework that utilized the joint vehicle ownership and usage decision model to quantitatively measure the impacts of the two quota policies, in terms of compensating variation. It is shown that implementation of vehicle plate lottery system will invite more households who have lower preference of owning a vehicle, and {{will result in a}} decrease in net social impact. The thesis then proposed an alternative policy that restricts the lottery to only previous car owners, and shows that it will give a higher net social impact.

The researcher believes that Amendment 2 does not promote efficiency in the commercial summer flounder fishery, because higher costs have been accrued, with no additional benefit to the resource. it is believed that an alternative to state-by-state quotas, specifically regional quotas, could meet the overfishing definition specified in the Plan, while imposing less costs to the industry...|$|R

There is a very significant increase in exported numbers, reaching 28 individuals per annum in 2002. It is unclear how many T. truncatus {{have been used in}} domestic dolphinaria. A review of available information did not identify evidence to corroborate hypotheses that: (i) T. truncatus off Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago (where removals occur) does not show population structure; and (ii) virtually no bycatches occur in Cuban waters. Here it is argued that, considering Cuba's fully developed marine fisheries, some level of mortality from bycatch is inevitable. Other potential threats are also identified. Global phylogenetics research of T. truncatus is revealing unexpected and more complex, stock structures, in inshore (coastal) forms within relatively small areas. In Cuba, low mean group sizes (less than 10) suggest that one or more coastal stock(s) are exploited. Sex distribution of measured specimens suggest a significant bias towards extraction of females. It is concluded that sustainability of harvest levels of Cuban T. truncatus cannot be evaluated until abundance estimates become available and population structure is verified by molecular genetic methods. Pérez-Cao (2004) indicated that available density estimates should not be used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> [safe] catch <b>quotas.</b> The authors strongly recommend that international trade of T. truncatus from Cuba ceases until no-detriment can be authenticated and that more research be developed.

40|$|In {{the period}} of investigation, 1995 â€“ 2000, the Danish fishery for species meant for human {{consumption}} was managed by individual non-transferable vessel quotas, while the fishery for species meant for fishmeal and fish oil was subject to a total quota. The revenues of the fishermen targeting species for human consumption are therefore fixed {{on the assumption that}} they are price takers, and that they will maximize profits by minimizing their costs. To model the economic behaviour of the fishermen in terms of the optimal quota size per vessel and optimal fleet size, a dual cost-function approach is an appropriate choice. This method is applied using a generalized Leontief cost function to model the behaviour of the Danish fleet of trawlers below 50 GRT, targeting species for human consumption solely. The estimated cost function is used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the optimal <b>quotas</b> yielding: (i) minimum average cost and (ii) maximum profit. The results of the estimations show that the optimal quotas per vessel should be increased by more than 2. 5 times and consequently that the fleet should be reduced by more than 60 %.

Currently, 628 fish stocks are managed in New Zealand using the Quote Management System, {{which includes the}} 8 com- mercial flatfish species caught within the Exclusive Economic Zone. These eight species of flatfish, which includes four species of flounder, two species of sole, brill and turbot, are currently managed using a combined catch quota. Since these eight species are managed using a common catch quota, there is concern {{that some of the}} individual species may be under or over-fished. This thesis describes work involving the flatfish species caught in the FLA 3 man- agement area, around the south island of New Zealand. The FLA 3 management area contains three key species: New Zealand sole, lemon sole, and sand flounder. Due to the nature and limitations of the data available, simple biomass dynamic models were applied to these species.

40|$|Abstract only. Every {{fish species}} {{is part of}} a complex {{ecosystem}} which competes with other species for resources. Likewise, the harvesting of fish species often involves technological interactions which results in catching multiple species as well as temporal interactions between species as fishermen allocate their effort across multiple fisheries {{over the course of a}} year. Ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management should address both the interactions that occur in the biological ecosystem as well as the larger economic system in which the harvesters operate. Single species management of multispecies fisheries ignores these interactions often to the detriment of the health of the ecosystem, the stocks of fish species, and fishery profits. This paper solves a dynamic optimization problem of maximizing the value from a three species fishery and determines the optimal harvest quota of each species given the biological, technological, and temporal interactions. Using this framework, a multispecies Euler equation, a modified multispecies golden rule, and a multispecies version of the fundamental equation of renewable resources are derived. The model is then applied to the pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder fisheries in Alaska <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the optimal harvesting quota for each species over time. The population of each species is then simulated into the future with and without each set of interactions to isolate the impact of each type of species interactions on the sustainability and profitability of the fishery.
