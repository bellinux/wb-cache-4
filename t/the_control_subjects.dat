25|$|Schneider et al. {{also studied}} {{the effects of}} {{combining}} music therapy with standard motor rehabilitation methods. In this experiment, researchers recruited stroke patients without prior musical experience and trained half of them in an intensive step by step training program that occurred fifteen times over three weeks, in addition to traditional treatment. These participants were trained to use both fine and gross motor movements by learning {{how to use the}} piano and drums. The other half of the patients received only traditional treatment {{over the course of the}} three weeks. Three-dimensional movement analysis and clinical motor tests showed participants who received the additional music therapy had significantly better speed, precision, and smoothness of movement as compared to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects.</b> Participants who received music therapy also showed a significant improvement in every-day motor activities as compared to the control group. Wilson, Parsons, & Reutens looked at the effect of melodic intonation therapy (MIT) on speech production in a male singer with severe Broca's aphasia. In this study, thirty novel phrases were taught in three conditions: unrehearsed, rehearsed verbal production (repetition), or rehearsed verbal production with melody (MIT). Results showed that phrases taught in the MIT condition had superior production, and that compared to rehearsal, effects of MIT lasted longer.|$|E

40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injury {{continues to be}} a constant adversary to field sports athletes. Females are widely acknowledged as being at an increased risk of ACL injury, in comparison to males. Athletes who are successful in rehabilitation after surgery and return to their sport are reported to have an increased risk of repeated ACL injury and the development of osteoarthritis. The current thesis utilised a novel, maximal drop-jump land and unanticipated cutting task to assess the lower limb biomechanics of uninjured male and females, and previously ACL injured subjects (ACLr). Discrete measures of lower limb kinematics and kinetics were firstly compared between uninjured males and females, and secondly between the previously injured (PI) leg of ACLr subjects and both the contralateral non-injured (NI) leg and an uninjured <b>subject’s</b> <b>control</b> leg. <b>The</b> results show that females had increased hip internal rotation, the PI leg was not significantly different to the NI leg but was different to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg with increased hip flexion, internal knee abduction moment and transverse plane knee ROM. Lower limb coordination was assessed in the ACLr subjects and both legs of the ACLr subjects had similar coordination patterns. The PI leg however showed different coordination patterns than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg for a number of couplings. Movement and coordination variability were also utilised for a gender and ACLr – <b>control</b> comparison. <b>The</b> female <b>subjects</b> and the PI leg had lower levels of movement and coordination variability than males and the contralateral non-injured leg respectively. The PI leg however, had higher levels of movement and coordination variability than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject’s</b> leg. In conclusion, females and previously ACL injured subjects may be at an increased risk of initial ACL injury and the development of osteoarthritis on the PI leg respectively, due to lower levels of movement and coordination variability. Altered biomechanics at the hip were also highlighted as a potential mechanism increasing injury risk in females and ACLr subjects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{the present}} study was {{described}} the kinematic characteristics of gait in stroke patients with two different arteries involved. [Subjects and Methods] Two patients who had suffered a basilar (A) or middle (B) cerebral artery ischemic stroke were compared with a control (C). Seventeen inertial sensors were used with acquisition rate of 120 Hz. The participants walked 3 times on a 10 meter walkway. From the raw data, the three gait cycles from the middle of each trial were chosen and analyzed. [Results] During the stance phase, patients A and B had a lower hip angle at initial contact and maximum flexion angle during load response than <b>the</b> <b>control.</b> Patient A and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subject</b> had similar knee angle values at initial contact, and patient B presented a flexed position in the initial phase of the gait cycle. The maximum flexion angles during loading response were also higher for patient B. The sagittal plane excursion for the ankle joint was lower for patient B in comparison with the other subjects.

50|$|A {{clinical}} study on patients with age related macula degeneration identified four significant proteins, including 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 1 (Rpn2), that were increased, according to semi-quantitative proteomic profiling. The {{study reported that}} an LC-MRM assay revealed a significant increase of Rpn2 in 15 macula degeneration patients compared to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>subjects,</b> suggesting that this protein could be a biomarker for this condition. Age-related macular degeneration {{is the leading cause}} of blindness in the world. Evidence is accumulating that the suppression of the UPS contributes to the increase of toxic proteins and inflammation in retina pigment epithelium, the functional abnormalities and/or the degeneration of which are believed to be the initiators and major pathologies of macula degeneration. There are only limited options for the treatment of macular degeneration, thus early identification of susceptibility and preventive measures are important therapeutic strategies. New potential biomarkers for neovascular macular degeneratuon and UPS-related proteins that are altered in patients such as Rpn2 may serve as the basis for future clinical studies to determine target proteins involved in the protection of the eye against macula degeneration.|$|E

It is currently unclear, however, whether this abnormality {{is related to}} a particular symptom of psychosis or to psychosis in general.

Thirty-five patients with a psychotic disorder, 35 non-psychotic subjects with relatively isolated auditory verbal hallucinations and 35 healthy <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> participated in this study. All subjects were scanned on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, while covertly performing a paced verbal fluency task. In order to measure performance on the task, one additional task block was presented during which subjects had to generate words overtly. In addition to calculating language lateralization indices, group-wise brain activation during verbal fluency was compared between the three groups. Task performance was nearly maximal for all groups and did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with <b>the</b> healthy <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> and non-psychotic subjects with auditory verbal hallucinations, language lateralization was significantly reduced for the patient group. In addition, the patients displayed significantly greater activity in the right precentral gyrus and left insula when compared with <b>the</b> healthy <b>control</b> <b>subjects</b> and <b>the</b> non-psychotic subjects with auditory verbal hallucinations.
