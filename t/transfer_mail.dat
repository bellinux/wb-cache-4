50|$|A {{third-party}} {{mail transfer}} program, called Mailrun, was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to <b>transfer</b> <b>mail</b> using the bi-directional HS/Link protocol. In theory, {{the use of}} the bi-directional protocol (which sent and received files at the same time) will shorten the length of dial-up netmail calls, saving the sysop some long-distance phone charges. This program {{can be used as a}} replacement for the proprietary MDRIVer program, but requires {{the use of the}} proprietary MBAGger & MDIST programs. With proper setup, Mailrun can co-exist with MDRIVer, allowing systems to use both programs to <b>transfer</b> <b>mail.</b> Mailrun is freeware, but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems. Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.|$|E

50|$|His {{expertise}} {{was called}} upon {{not only in}} the UK but also in various locations in Europe. In 1866, he was sent to inspect the railway systems of France and Italy, in order to determine how best to <b>transfer</b> <b>mail</b> destined for India from northern France to the Italian port of Brindisi. On his recommendation the route was accepted. In 1867, he investigated London's water supply following an outbreak of cholera, an investigation which involved emptying a reservoir of the East London Waterworks Company next to the river Lea, and tasting the contaminated water. His report helped confirm that cholera was water-borne rather than by the air.|$|E
5000|$|A {{small village}} sprang {{up in the}} 1890s when Martin W. Hubbard, who had lived with his family on the hill east of the area since the 1870s, {{constructed}} a dock on the lake shore. The village was named Hubbard, after him. A post office was established, with Hubbard as postmaster, which required him to <b>transfer</b> <b>mail</b> between Seattle and Juanita by rowboat. Dorr Forbes, a civil war veteran, settled in Kirkland in 1877. After living on his original claim at Forbes Lake (then known as Kirkland Lake) on Rose Hill, he relocated to the Juanita area in the mid-1880s where he established a small shingle mill {{in what is now}} Forbes Park, roughly three blocks north of the waterfront. Prior to the mill, there was little demand for lumber and trees were simply burned to clear land. A dam was built across Juanita Creek in order to form a log pond for the mill. After a Dry kiln was installed at the mill in 1894, it burned to the ground and was not rebuilt. Harry Langdon, son of 1877 pioneer Roland Langdon, established the community's first store. Dairy and agriculture farms began to gradually take the place of the cleared forests and several gravel pits that served the City of Seattle were operated in the area in the 1910s and 1920s. The lowering of Lake Washington in 1915 shrunk the size of Juanita Bay considerably.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mail systems {{comprise}} different {{components to}} accomplish all mail activities. On {{the top of}} these mail system functions is the message submission, delivery, and retrieval on a target host. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMPT) is the mail transport protocol used to <b>transfer</b> <b>mail</b> between hosts. In SMTP session, like any protocol, two participants are involved. The first is the client that initiates the session and manages connection by sending requests. The other, which is the server, waits for such requests that trigger responses. This paper presents an enhanced messages delivery approach through a proposed SMTP client. A proposed architecture implementation is presented {{as well as the}} algorithm workflow for processing mails by the SMTP client. The paper provides a per-host grouping strategy that minimizes the delivery time of messages queue to multiple hosts by processing all messages belonging to the same host mail server as a one bulk. A comparative study for messages delivery with and without the grouping mechanism proved a significant reduction the the time for delivering a queue of messages. In addition to grouping, the features contributed in threading and session handling, prioritized delivery, and pipelining enhanced the way and performance of mails delivery to destination hosts...|$|E
