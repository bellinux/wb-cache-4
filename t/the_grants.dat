5|$|As part of Oregon's {{initial state}} highway system, {{the road from}} Grants Pass {{southwest}} to Wilderville and then along the Crescent City Plank Road to the state line was named <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> Pass-Crescent City Highway No. 25 in November 1917. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> Pass-Crescent City route, via the Gasquet Toll Road, was a narrow, winding unpaved mountain road with long grades and some remaining plank road in California. California added its portion to the state highway system in 1919, for the state's third highway bond issue, {{as an extension of}} Legislative Route 1. By 1924, the road was part of the Redwood Highway, which continued south to Sausalito, but was still completely unimproved between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. (Oregon changed <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> Pass-Crescent City Highway name to Redwood Highway in May 1924.) A new highway between Gasquet and Kerby was completed by the two states in September 1926, and in June 1929 the new Hiouchi Bridge over the Smith River was dedicated, bypassing the remainder of the old road over Howland Hill. In 1948, US 199 became part of the Winnemucca to the Sea Highway, organized to promote the route that has largely become Nevada State Route 140 and Oregon Route 140 from I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada to Crescent City. One major improvement to the highway's alignment was made after 1929: the Collier Tunnel replaced the winding route over Hazel View Summit in California on July 20, 1963.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, Grant {{and his family}} stayed with Fish in Washington for two months before setting out on a world tour that lasted {{approximately}} {{two and a half}} years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana. During the tour <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> made stops in Europe, the Mediterranean the Holy Land and points in the Middle East, meeting with notable dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Emperor Meiji and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. During the tour, supported by the Hayes administration transported on naval ships, Grant assumed an unprecedented diplomatic capacity, unofficially representing the United States to strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> left Japan sailing on the City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} to Normandy {{for the last}} time in 1148, Matilda ceased to use the title Lady of the English, simply styling herself as empress again; she never adopted the title of Countess of Anjou. Matilda's household became smaller, and often merged with Henry's own court when the two were co-located in Rouen. She continued to play a special role in the government of the area around Argentan, where she held feudal rights from <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> made {{at the time of her}} second marriage.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{acquired}} by the British Museum in April 1994. As the Museum's entire purchase fund amounted to only £1.4 million at the time, the hoard had to be purchased {{with the assistance of}} donors that included the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (now the Art Fund), and the J. Paul Getty Trust. <b>The</b> <b>grants</b> from these and other benefactors enabled the museum to raise the £1.75 million needed for the acquisition.|$|E
5|$|After Edward Balliol's coup {{against the}} Bruce regime in 1333, he {{attempted}} to court John of Islay, Lord of the Isles. In 1336, Edward confirmed the territories which the Islay lords had acquired {{in the days of}} Robert I and awarded John the lands of Kintyre, Knapdale, Gigha, Colonsay, Mull, Skye, Lewis, and Morvern, previously held by magnates still loyal to the Bruces. John, however, never provided Edward with real assistance. Although Balliol's deposition and the restoration of the House of Bruce meant that <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> made to John were void, his pre-1336 possessions were confirmed by King David II in 1343. Moreover, in 1346, John inherited the great Lordship of Garmoran through his brother-in-law Raghnall MacRuaridh. This meant that John's dominions now included all of the Hebrides except Skye, and all of the western seaboard from Morvern to Loch Hourn.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he {{became interested in}} the New Hampshire Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from <b>the</b> <b>Grants.</b> When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{takes advantage}} of a new intergovernmental grant in order to investigate the expenditure behavior of the municipalities in Sweden in two ways. First, <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> is used to study the effect on municipal spending related to <b>the</b> <b>grant.</b> Second, <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> is used to test a hypothesis of spatial interaction among municipalities due to mimicking behavior. <b>The</b> <b>grant</b> and expenditures studied here pertain to one specific service area of the Swedish municipalities; services to functionally impaired individuals. <b>The</b> <b>grant</b> was introduced in 2004. The data used pertains to the period before (2001 - 2003) and after (2004 - 2007) the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>grant.</b> A fixed-effects spatial lag model is used to study the (possible) spatial interactions among municipalities. Interestingly, {{the results show that}} during the first time period, the municipalities interact with their neighbors when setting the expenditure level, possibly due to mimicking. In the second time period, after the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>grant,</b> {{there is no evidence of}} interaction.

5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from <b>the</b> <b>Grants</b> Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument.

5|$|King Arthur was {{assigned}} many different arms, {{but from the}} 13th century, he was most commonly given three gold crowns on an azure field (Loomis 1938, 38). In a 1394 manuscript depicting the Nine Worthies, Arthur is shown holding a flag with three gold crowns (Neubecker, 172). The reason for the triple-crown symbol is unknown, but it was associated with other pre-Norman kings, with the seal of Magnus II of Sweden, with the relics of the Three Wise Men in Cologne (which led to the three crowns in the seal of the University of Cologne), and with <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> of Edward I of England to towns which were symbolized by three crowns in the towns' arms.

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{number of}} <b>Grant</b> Schools peaked {{at the end}} of the 19th century, with more than 100 schools {{receiving}} <b>grants</b> under <b>the</b> <b>Grant</b> Code. <b>The</b> majority of <b>the</b> <b>Grant</b> Schools by that time were the vernacular schools which provided Chinese education. Nevertheless, these vernacular schools were criticised by the school inspectors for their appalling academic performance. Students were near-illiterate and could not handle subject knowledge.

Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority.
