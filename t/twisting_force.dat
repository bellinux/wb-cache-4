25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a <b>twisting</b> <b>force</b> against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E

40|$|Purpose.

Methodology. To determine the energy reserves the <b>twisting</b> <b>forces</b> diagrams were used. A method is based on the comparative analysis of areas of braking and power operation modes of ropeway drive. Their area depends on the road profile (length and overfall of clearance heights, carrying rope deflection) and location of the drive station (on the lower or the upper supporting points). Findings. The application of the method of energy accumulation in the braking mode with its subsequent consumption in the power mode enables to use the energy reserves of drives. Taking into account the relief, it is possible on the stage of planning to set the parameters the road profile, as well as to locate the drive station so that on the <b>twisting</b> <b>forces</b> diagram the areas of braking mode alternated with the areas of the power mode and were approximately equal in size. This, in turn, will save the electric power in the process of operation. Originality. The approach to determination of energy reserves of the aerial ropeway drives is offered. Practical value. The use of the offered method will help (before the construction) to calculate such a road profile, which will increase the areas of braking mode. The latter in turn will positively affect the size of the accumulated energy...|$|R

50|$|A {{centrifugal}} <b>twisting</b> <b>force</b> {{is experienced}} by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch.

50|$|While rope may be {{made from}} three or more strands, modern braided rope {{consists}} of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional <b>twisting</b> <b>force</b> when they are stressed.

50|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring.

Then the magnitude of the force is proportional to the angle of the bar. The sensitivity of the instrument comes from the weak spring constant of the fiber, so a very weak force causes a large rotation of the bar.|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} factual {{allegations of}} the amended complaint are as follows. Plaintiff {{was born on}} May 14, 1970. On repeated occasions {{during the first year}} of her life she was severely beaten by her mother and the latter’s common law husband, one Reyes. On April 26, 1971, when the plaintiff was eleven months old, her mother took her to the San Jose Hospital for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. The attending physician was defendant Dr. Flood, acting on his own behalf and as agent of the defendant San Jose Hospital. At the time, the plaintiff was suffering from a comminuted spiral fracture of the right tibia and fibula, which gave the appearance of having been caused by a <b>twisting</b> <b>force.</b> Plaintiff’s mother had no explanation for this injury. Plaintiff had bruises over her entire body. In addition, she had a non-depressed linear skull fracture which was then in the process of healing. Plaintiff demonstrated fear and apprehension when approached.

50|$|TCC helps {{patients}} {{to maintain their}} quality of life. By encasing the patient’s complete foot — including the toes and lower leg — in a specialist cast to redistribute weight and pressure from the foot to the lower leg during everyday movements, patients can remain mobile.

40|$|In the {{locomotion}} of man, usually, three step-force components (comression, anterior-posterior and transcurrent force) {{have been}} concerned.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the stresses generated at bracket-cement and the tooth continuum by different bracket debonding techniques commonly used in orthodontic clinic. Materials and methods: Peeling, <b>twisting</b> and masticatory <b>force</b> of one Newton was applied on the finite element model of bracket-cement and the tooth assembly and the principle stresses were obtained through the ANSYS software. The validated three-dimensional finite element model of the bracket-cement-tooth system constructed for the study consisted of 40, 536 nodes and 49, 201 finite elements.
