5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|When Phantoms {{were first}} {{delivered}} to interceptor squadrons, they {{remained in the}} grey-green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in the new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, low visibility roundels and markings. However, although the roundel remained in low visibility colours, individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|Lutyens' {{designs were}} {{complete}} by 1920 and approved in November of that year, {{but as the}} chosen site {{was part of the}} churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a faculty from the Diocese of Peterborough (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation. The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners. Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the Northampton Independent reported that the obelisks had been carved and were waiting for the flags <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> before they could be erected.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E
5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E

25|$|In February the Pacific Fleet, {{deciding}} {{that the primary}} threat to its ships was now kamikaze, directed that all ships be repainted in Measure 12, 21 or 22, and dazzle schemes began to disappear again.

25|$|By 1966 {{they began}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in {{corporate}} Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air brake equipment, the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> blue was D9014). In the early 1970s they were fitted with Electric Train Heating (ETH) equipment {{to power the}} new generation of air-conditioned coaches, while a couple of years later, with the introduction of BR's TOPS computer system, they were renumbered 55 001 to 55 022.
