25|$|The {{antibiotics}} erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin {{are typically}} the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to {{lower rates of}} side effects. <b>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> (TMP/SMX) {{may be used in}} those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.|$|E
25|$|In {{many areas}} of the world, {{antibiotic}} resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and erythromycin. Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi-drug resistant cases. New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in in vitro studies.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{vulvovaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia, or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.</b> Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
25|$|In {{those cases}} of abscess which do require {{antibiotic}} treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria {{is a common}} cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess {{is not enough to}} address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.</b> The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels.|$|E

2500|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} usually treated with {{antibiotic}}s. However, the antibiotic sensitivities of different strains of E. coli vary widely. As gram-negative organisms, E. coli {{are resistant to}} many antibiotics that are effective against gram-positive organisms. Antibiotics which {{may be used to}} treat E. coli infection include amoxicillin, as well as other semisynthetic penicillins, many cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, [...] <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and the aminoglycosides.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} course of antibiotics although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment {{is a matter of}} debate. Some experts recommend probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO. Prokinetic drugs are other options but research in humans is limited. A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, neomycin, cephalexin, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and nitazoxanide have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin.|$|E
2500|$|In general, an isolate is {{suspected}} {{to be an}} ESBL producer when it shows in vitro susceptibility to the second-generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to aztreonam. Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported in vitro susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as [...] "resistant" [...] to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, {{even if it is}} tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> as well as high frequency of co-existence of fluoroquinolone resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. Cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. In vivo studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. (Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated in vitro stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, carbapenems are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.|$|E

50|$|Stomatococcus {{mucilaginous}} is {{resistant to}} the quinolone class of antibiotics, with extreme resistance to fluoroquinolones. Sensitivity, as of 2003, is still found in <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> vancomycin and bacitracin.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotic {{therapy with}} a sulfonamide, most {{commonly}} <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> is {{the treatment of}} choice. People who take <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> for other reasons, such as prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, appear to have fewer Nocardia infections, although this protective effect has been considered unreliable, and some studies have disputed it altogether. Minocycline is usually substituted when a sulfa cannot be given; high-dose imipenem and amikacin have also been used in severe or refractory cases. Linezolid appears to be highly effective against Nocardia, {{but it is very}} expensive and may cause severe adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{resistant}} {{to a variety}} of antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, and aminoglycosides. Ampicillin and carbenicillin, which are penicillins, are an exception. It is variably susceptible to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and colistin.|$|E
50|$|In {{infected}} donkeys, B. bennetti formed cysts in the eyes, mouth, and testes. The mode {{of transmission}} among donkeys has not been determined. Treatments with ponazuril, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and nitroxinide {{have been unable to}} clear infection.|$|E
50|$|As {{resistance}} to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and streptomycin is now common, these agents {{have not been}} used as first-line treatment of typhoid fever for almost 20 years.

50|$|It has {{not been}} shown to cause birth defects in animal studies when given intravenously. There are no {{controlled}} studies to show if pentamidine can harm the fetus in pregnant women. It is only recommended if the drug of choice <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> is contraindicated.|$|E
50|$|Typhoid fever, when {{properly}} treated, is not fatal in most cases. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, {{have been}} {{commonly used to}} treat typhoid fever in microbiology. Treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to about 1%.|$|E
50|$|The {{antibiotics}} erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin {{are typically}} the recommended treatment.

50|$|Bacteriostatic agents, such as sulfonamides, target dihydropteroate {{synthetase}}. The {{effect of}} dihydropteroate synthetase inhibition {{is comparable to}} that of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition by trimethoprim, another bacteriostatic agent.

5000|$|Treatment {{options include}} {{antibiotic}} therapy or a so-called [...] "watchful waiting" [...] approach. The {{great majority of}} clinical isolates of this organism produce beta-lactamases, so are resistant to penicillin. Resistance to trimethoprim, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, and tetracycline have been reported. It is susceptible to fluoroquinolones, most second- and third-generation cephalosporins, erythromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate.|$|E
50|$|The {{hallmarks}} of anaerobic infection include suppuration, {{establishment of an}} abscess, thrombophlebitis and gangrenous destruction of tissue with gas generation. Anaerobic bacteria are very commonly recovered in chronic infections, and are often found following the failure of therapy with antimicrobials that are ineffective against them, such as <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> (co-trimoxazole), aminoglycosides, and the earlier quinolones.|$|E
50|$|Folate {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} by unhealthy diets that do not include enough fruits and vegetables, diseases in which folates are not well absorbed in the digestive system (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease), some genetic disorders that affect levels of folate, and certain medicines (such as phenytoin, sulfasalazine, or <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).</b> Folate deficiency is accelerated by alcohol consumption.|$|E

5000|$|Physicians often {{prescribe}} {{the antibiotic}} <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> to prevent bacterial infections. [...] This drug {{also has the}} benefit of sparing the normal bacteria of the digestive tract. Fungal infection is commonly prevented with itraconazole, although a newer drug of the same type called voriconazole may be more effective. [...] The use of this drug for this purpose is still under scientific investigation.|$|E
50|$|E. faecalis is {{resistant}} to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, the semisynthetic penicillins nafcillin and oxacillin, and <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).</b> Resistance to vancomycin in E. faecalis {{is becoming more}} common. Treatment options for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis include nitrofurantoin (in the case of uncomplicated UTIs), linezolid, and daptomycin, although ampicillin is preferred if the bacteria are susceptible. Quinupristin/dalfopristin {{can be used to}} treat Enterococcus faecium but not E. faecalis.|$|E
50|$|Dapsone is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} and prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients who are allergic to or intolerant of <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.</b> Acedapsone is a derivative of dapsone that has little activity against M. leprae but is converted to an active dapsone metabolite. It is a long-acting intramuscular repository form of dapsone with a half-life of 46 days. It may prove useful in leprosy patients who cannot tolerate long-term oral dapsone therapy.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{the disease}} {{resolves}} within {{four to eight}} days without antibiotics. Severe infections may last three to six weeks. Antibiotics, such as <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> ciprofloxacin may be given when the person is very young or very old, when the disease is severe, or when {{the risk of the}} infection spreading to other people is high. Additionally, ampicillin (but not amoxicillin) was effective in treating this disease previously, but now the first choice of drug is pivmecillinam.|$|E
5000|$|Clostridium tertium {{bacteremia}} {{can cause}} fever, and directed antibiotic therapy is indicated. [...] C. tertium is commonly (but not universally) resistant to many β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin; clindamycin; and metronidazole; {{but it is}} susceptible to vancomycin, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> and ciprofloxacin. Mortality related to C. tertium bacteremia treated appropriately appears to be quite low. The selection effect of antibiotics on C. tertium may occur in cases where patients have had prior exposure to β-lactam antibiotics.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} on which species or strain of Bartonella is found in a given patient. While Bartonella species are susceptible {{to a number of}} standard antibiotics in vitro [...] - [...] macrolides and tetracycline, for example [...] - [...] the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in immunocompetent individuals is uncertain. Immunocompromised patients should be treated with antibiotics because they are particularly susceptible to systemic disease and bacteremia. Drugs of particular effectiveness include <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin; B. henselae is generally resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and nafcillin.|$|E
50|$|Recommended regimen is {{doxycycline}} 100 mg orally {{twice a day}}, alternatively azithromycin 1 g orally {{once per}} week or ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally twice a day or erythromycin base 500 mg orally {{four times a day}} or <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</b> one double-strength (160 mg/800 mg) tablet orally twice a day. All antibiotic regimens should last for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed. Normally, the infection will begin to subside within a week of treatment, but the full treatment period must be followed to minimize the possibility of relapse.|$|E
50|$|This {{bacterium}} {{is usually}} multiresistant to antibiotics typically prescribed for treating gram-negative bacterial infections, including extended-spectrum beta-lactam agents (due to production by most strains of two betalactamases: one ESBL and one Class B Carbapenem-Hydrolyzing metallolactamase), aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Though vancomycin {{has been used}} in the past, its high MIC (16 µg/ml) has led to a search for alternatives, especially for meningitis. Presently ciprofloxacin, minocycline, <b>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,</b> rifampin and novobiocin are considered good alternatives. Most of these are classic drugs for gram positive bacteria and not routinely tested on gram negative bacteria.|$|E
