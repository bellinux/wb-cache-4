40|$|Mrlgnetized Target Fusion (MTF) has {{attracted}} {{renewed interest in}} recent years because of its potential to resolve {{one of the major}} problems with conventional fusion energy research- the high cost of facilities to do experiments and in general develop practical fusion energy. The requirement for costly facilities can be traced to fundamental constraints. The Lawson condition implies large system size in the case of conventional magnetic confinement, or large heating power in the case of conventional inertial confinement. The MTF approach is to use much higher fuel density than with conventional magnetic confinement (corresponding to mega bar pressures), which results in a much-reduced system size to achieve Lawson conditions. Intrinsically the system must be pulsed because the pressures exceed the strength of any known material. To facilitate heating the fuel (or "target") to <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>conditions</b> with a high-power source of energy, magnetic fields are used to insulate the high-pressure fuel from material surroundings (thus "magnetized target"). Because of magnetic insulation, the required heating power is reduced by many orders of magnitude compared to conventional inertial fusion, even with relatively poor energy confinement in the magnetic field, such as that characterizedby Bohm diffusion. This paper shows semi-quantitatively why MTF should allow fusion energy production without costly facilitios within the same generally accepted physical constraints used for conventional magnetic and inertial fusion.

30|$|To {{achieve the}} <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>condition</b> (n̅τ _ET̅ > 5 × 10 ^ 21 m^ - 3 s keV) in magnetically {{confined}} configurations such as tokamak, {{it is necessary}} to maintain plasma for sufficient time. Therefore, input power time (energy confinement time) {{is one of the most}} important parameters of the plasma ignition in tokamaks [1, 2, 3]. In general, input power time should be analyzed by microscopic and transport behavior of the plasma. The maximum energy confinement time can be determined by the microscopic behavior of the plasma such as collisions and microinstabilities. This behavior ultimately leads to macroscopic energy transport, which can be either classical or anomalous depending on the processes involved. In the absence of instabilities, the confinement of toroidally symmetric tokamak plasma is determined by Coulomb collisions. Since these phenomena require a knowledge of individual particles motion on short length scales and time scales, they are usually treated by kinetic models, but including only limited geometry because of the complexity of the physics.|$|R

40|$|Fusion {{parameters}} in a Staged pinch are studied numerically. The imploding Z-pinch plasma traps an axial {{magnetic field}} Bz, compressing it to large values (of {{the order of}} several megagauss) in an extremely short time (in nanosecond). Fastly changing magnetic flux then induces an azimuthal (Î¸) current {{on the surface of}} the co axially placed fiber, with a rise time an order of magnitude shorter than the applied current. We have investigated the dynamics of staged pinch with different stability criterion defined to mitigate the R-T instability. First of all, spinning effect in the thick and thin shells is introduced to reduce the initial perturbations. To study the dynamics of the D-T fiber MHD model was used. To study the dynamics of gas puff, snowplow model along with thin shell model were used. We have also introduced Kr impurity in the fiber to incorporate radiation losses so as to enhance the compression. Thick puffs are considered stable as compared with the thin shells but from the numerical results we conclude that fusion parameters cannot be achieved in the presence of large values of spin velocity. It was also observed that bremsstrahlung reduction caused by opacity has very minor effects on the temperature profiles. In order to minimize the effect of the R-T instability on the implosion dynamics and to achieve the plasma parameters of interest, it was proposed to have finite thickness and multicascade liner system for the imploding shells.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply Z-Pinch fusion principles to the design of a propulsion system for an interplanetary spacecraft. This study took four steps in service of that objective; these steps are identified below. 1. Z-Pinch Modeling and Analysis: There is a wealth of literature characterizing Z-Pinch physics and existing Z-Pinch physics models. In order to be useful in engineering analysis, simplified Z-Pinch fusion thermodynamic models are required to give propulsion engineers the quantity of plasma, plasma temperature, rate of expansion, etc. The study team developed these models in this study. 2. Propulsion Modeling and Analysis: While the Z-Pinch models characterize the fusion process itself, propulsion models calculate the parameters that characterize the propulsion system (thrust, specific impulse, etc.) The study team developed a Z-Pinch propulsion model and used it to determine the best values for pulse rate, amount of propellant per pulse, and mixture ratio of the D-T and liner materials as well as the resulting thrust and specific impulse of the system. 3. Mission Analysis: Several potential missions were studied. Trajectory analysis using data from the propulsion model was used to determine the duration of the propulsion burns, the amount of propellant expended to complete each mission considered. 4.

40|$|Fusion-based nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has the potential}} to enable fast interplanetary transportation. Due to the great distances between the planets of our solar system and the harmful radiation environment of interplanetary space, high specific impulse (Isp) propulsion in vehicles with high payload mass fractions must be developed to provide practical and safe vehicles for human spaceflight missions. Magneto-Inertial Fusion (MIF) is an approach which has been shown to potentially lead to a low cost, small fusion reactor/engine assembly (1). The Z-Pinch dense plasma focus method is an MIF concept in which a column of gas is compressed to <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>conditions</b> by an estimated axial current of approximately 100 MA. Recent advancements in experiments and the theoretical understanding of this concept suggest favorable scaling of fusion power output yield as I(sup 4) (2). The magnetic field resulting from the large current compresses the plasma to fusion conditions, and this is repeated over short timescales (10 (exp - 6) sec). This plasma formation is widely used in the field of Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) testing in the defense industry, as well as in fusion energy research. There is a wealth of literature characterizing Z-Pinch physics and existing models (3 - 5). In order to be useful in engineering analysis, a simplified Z-Pinch fusion thermodynamic model was developed to determine the quantity of plasma, plasma temperature, rate of expansion, energy production, etc. to calculate the parameters that characterize a propulsion system. The amount of nuclear fuel per pulse, mixture ratio of the D-T and nozzle liner propellant, and assumptions about the efficiency of the engine, enabled the sizing of the propulsion system and resulted in an estimate of the thrust and Isp of a Z-Pinch fusion propulsion system for the concept vehicle. MIF requires a magnetic nozzle to contain and direct the nuclear pulses, as well as a robust structure and radiation shielding. The structure, configuration, and materials of the nozzle must meet many severe requirements. The configuration would focus, in a conical manner, the Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) fuel and Lithium- 6 / 7 liner fluid to meet at a specific point that acts as a cathode so the Li- 6 can serve as a current return path to complete the circuit. In addition to serving as a current return path, the Li liner also serves as a radiation shield. The advantage to this configuration is the reaction between neutrons and Li- 6 results in the production of additional Tritium, thus adding further fuel to the fusion reaction and boosting the energy output. To understand the applicability of Z-Pinch propulsion to interplanetary travel, it is necessary to design a concept vehicle that uses it. The propulsion system significantly impacts the design of the electrical, thermal control, avionics, radiation shielding, and structural subsystems of a vehicle. The design reference mission is the transport of crew and cargo to Mars and back, with the intention that the vehicle be reused for other missions. Several aspects of this vehicle are based on a previous crewed fusion vehicle study called Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE), which employed a Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) propulsion concept. Analysis of this propulsion system concludes that a 40 -fold increase of Isp over chemical propulsion is predicted. This along with a greater than 30 % predicted payload mass fraction certainly warrants further development of enabling technologies. The vehicle is designed for multiple interplanetary missions and conceivably may be suited for an automated one-way interstellar voyage...|$|E
40|$|The most {{challenging}} conceptual problem of thermonuclear energy research based on deuterium plasmas magnetically trapped in toroidal machines, named tokamaks, consists {{in how to}} control and actively shape during operations the current density radial profile of plasma column. To achieve this control is of paramount importance, indeed, for the following reasons: i) to prevent the onset of unstable modes that detriment the figures of stability and fusion power gain from thermonuclear reactions, which are necessary for a reactor; ii) to remove the obstacle of tokamaks of being intrinsically inductive machines, i. e., capable of producing only transient plasma regimes, {{in front of the}} reactor’s need of operating in steady- state. In regard to the former problem, data of modelling and experiments available in the last 25 years showed that the growth rate of pernicious unstable plasma modes, of magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) nature, is strongly depressed when a relative maximum of the plasma current density is suitably located at radii close to the region that interests the unstable modes. They make challenging the possibility of achieving the desired thermal insulation that is necessary for allowing <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>conditions</b> of high temperatures (∼ 100 million of degrees) and high density (∼ 1020 m- 3) of plasma. The limitation of pulsed operation was, instead, well known since the assessment (half century ago) of the tokamak concept, and this was soon perceived as the major conceptual obstacle against the development of a thermonuclear fusion reactor. Indeed, at that time, the further problem of the onset of unstable modes (which produces anomalous transport effects, on heat and matter, via micro-turbulence and MHD modes) did not appear yet. The discovery in 1981 at Princeton (USA) of the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) effect was considered very attractive for facing both the mentioned major problems of a reactor. The LHCD effect consists in the capability of multimegawatt microwave power at several gigahertz, coupled to quasi-electrostatic natural modes of plasma, named lower hybrid (LH) waves, of non- inductively producing current in tokamak plasma. Consequently, the plasma current can flow with continuity in a tokamak under RF power injection. The antenna consists in phased arrays of rectangular waveguides that suitably fit the gaps of the tokamak’s magnet. Via electronic setting of the waveguide phasing, the refractive index (n//, in the direction parallel to the confinement magnetic field) of the RF power spectrum can be usefully determined in order to Landau-resonate with a tail of the electron distribution of plasma electrons, for the temperature that corresponds to the radial layer where the current drive effect would be desirably produced. As further support of attractiveness of the LHCD effect, it should be considered that other methods utilising radiofrequency power in the ion-cyclotron and electron-cyclotron resonant frequencies, as well those that exploit strong power injection of energetic ion beams, present much lower efficiency in driving plasma current than that possible by the LHCD effect. Unfortunately, for long time the LHCD effect was observed to occur successfully only when operating at too low plasma densities – of about a factor three lower than that required by reactor – despite of the many attempts carried out for decades in many laboratories in the world. In these experiments, the RF power was however successfully coupled by the antenna, but remained unexpectedly deposited at the plasma periphery, as a consequence of parasitic effects of plasma edge. Only recently, an original research performed in the ENEA-Frascati Lab. – whose results have been published on Nature Communications: 5, 55, 2010 – has assessed a new method for enabling the occurrence of the LHCD effect at reactor graded high plasma densities. This method is based on previous theoretical predictions of reduced parasitic effect under higher temperature of plasma edge (ENEA Laboratory work published on Physical Review Letters in 2004). These works demonstrated that the parasitic damping of the coupled RF power is produced by non-linear wave-plasma interaction, named parametric instability (PI), which is capable of strongly altering (namely, broadening) the n// spectrum launched by the antenna. Consequently, the temperature required for Landau-resonance of the RF power spectrum with plasma electrons is strongly diminished, which causes absorption in the cold region of plasma periphery. This Thesis is focused on helping solution of an important conceptual problem, which is part of this challenge, by means of a noticeable application of strong radiofrequency power coupled to quasi- electrostatic plasma waves (LH waves). From the engineering point of view, results produced by an originally developed numerical code (LHPI) have backed solving the problem (existing for decades) of how to enable the antenna parameters determining the deposition of the coupled RF power (of several gigahertz) at a desired radial layer of the plasma column. This task would be ideally required indeed by an antenna. With respect to other current drive tool, based on electron cyclotron resonance (at about 150 GHz), this cannot guarantee the coverage of the outer half radius of plasma necessary for a reactor. Thanks to results reported here, new understanding is provided {{that for the first time}} enables a waveguide antenna for current drive in tokamaks to tailor the deposition in the plasma, in different operating conditions, by electronically acting on the launched spectrum (via feeding/phasing of waveguides). In particular, a) in case of too high plasma densities at the plasma edge, as occurs in running experiments, operation with higher temperature of plasma is recommended to avoid parasitic effects of spectral broadening. b) in case of too high plasma temperature at the plasma periphery, as envisaged in a future reactor, the assessment of a new antenna parameter, Δn//, allows however guaranteeing useful penetration of the coupled RF power into the plasma bulk. More specifically, the following issues have been considered in the Thesis. 1) Available data of RF power spectral broadening, kept during experiments carried out on the EAST tokamak (China), have been interpreted on the basis of the parametric instability modelling. This work has been performed thanks to a new version of a numerical code (developed on the basis of a previously version available since 1989 at ENEA-Frascati) having much improved qualities of velocity and precision. 2) The work has also focused on the key problem of how to enable the occurrence of the LHCD effect also in conditions of high electron temperature of reactor plasmas. Indeed, precisely the high temperature that in a reactor is expected to occur even at large radii of the plasma column which usefully prevents the occurrence of the parasitic effects observed in the experiments – would also produce an undesired RF power deposition too far out in the plasma, owing too strong electron Landau damping, as shown by numerical results. This circumstance is in contrast with the primary goal of a reactor of being equipped by current profile control, so that the too high plasma temperature of reactor represents the remaining major conceptual problem preventing the exploitation of the LHCD tool. This problem has been solved by the new outcome described in the Thesis. This result consists in having identified in a sufficiently narrow n// antenna power spectrum the way for reducing the wave-plasma interaction at high temperatures, thus enabling the penetration of the coupled RF power in the hot and dense regions of reactor plasmas. This diminished wave-plasma interaction is consequence of the content of standard quasi-linear theory of plasma waves: this aspect remained singularly undisclosed so far. 3) Finally, the thesis has analysed the problem of how to design an antenna capable of producing the required power spectra necessary for envisaging a current profile control system in a thermonuclear reactor. For carrying out this work, a numerical code has been utilised capable of treating waveguide antenna geometries however complex. Consequently, the desired sufficiently narrow n// power spectrum can be produced, indeed, by suitable array of active and passive phased array of rectangular waveguides. Moreover, the scan of the main antenna parameters (power reflection coefficient, directivity, etc,) performed assuming realistic conditions of plasma edge, has shown that all requirements should be satisfied for envisaging a current profile control system for a tokamak reactor based on the exploitation of the LHCD effect. The lower hybrid current drive tool in now fully supported by know how necessary for enabling the current profile control in the warm and dense plasma of thermonuclear reactor. The current drive method assessed here is of paramount importance for conceiving antennas to be implemented in the system of current profile control, which a reactor mandatorily requires...|$|E

This has led to the identification of four candidate processes, which could account for the differences between the results from our calculations and the lengths of the Li{sup + 1 } clouds observed during pellet penetration experiments on TFTR: 1) line-radiation from the cloud holding down its temperature, 2) the charging up of the cloud reducing the incident hot electron flux from the plasma, 3) the cooling of the plasma in contact with the cloud, and 4) the reduction of the heat flux of the incident electrons to the cloud due to the backscatter of these electrons from the cloud (i. e., albedo). However, while each of these was explored individually, all could not be incorporated into a single computer code during active funding. Previously, self-consistent equilibrium and non-equilibrium charge-state models were formulated for the spherical expansion of low-Z pellet vapor as an inviscid perfect gas of constant ratio of specific heats being heated volumetrically by the incident electrons of a thermonuclear plasma.
