There is no consensus on how much alcohol may be consumed safely.

Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.|$|E

This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{how much}} {{statehood}} {{it takes to}} make governance with/out the state work. The first part discusses the relationship between governance, state, and statehood. The distinction between governance as structure and governance as process allows us to disentangle state and statehood. The second part of the paper explores the different functions statehood has for governance. While there may be functional equivalents to the shadow of hierarchy, there is more to statehood than the threat of hierarchically imposed regulation. Effective and legitimate governance may require at least some (external) form of consolidated statehood. The final part of the paper discusses varieties of statehood, arguing that the challenge for areas of limited statehood is not the lack of exclusivity of statehood but the need for an order of shared and divided statehood. The paper concludes by considering <b>the</b> dark <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> statehood, <b>cautioning</b> against building states without strengthening {{the rule of law and}} democracy...|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because {{she thought it was}} obligatory, or because she had been taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes to err on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its legal}} troubles, SST {{continued}} to release records by artists including Minutemen, Saccharine Trust, and Meat Puppets. In 1982 Minneapolis hardcore group Hüsker Dü became the label's first non-West Coast signing. Following {{the resolution of}} the debacle with Unicorn Records, SST released four Black Flag albums in 1984. The multiple Black Flag albums, along with the double album releases Zen Arcade and Double Nickels on the Dime by Hüsker Dü and the Minutemen, respectively, stretched the label's resources. While SST believed Zen Arcade would be a sizable underground hit, pressings of over 5,000 copies were unknown territory for the label, so it erred on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> and did not print over that number in its initial pressing. Awarded critical acclaim by several mainstream media outlets, Zen Arcade sold out quickly and remained out of print for months. Ginn decided to cut the promotional costs of the Black Flag albums by issuing them in quick succession and having the band tour solidly behind the releases.|$|E

John Charles Thomas, representing the National District Attorneys Association, concluded [...] "The pressure is basically to err on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> to give the Miranda warning almost every time." [...] Professor Stephen Saltzburg of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of [...] "When in doubt, give Miranda warnings", but also opined {{that it would make}} little practical difference to young people facing police questioning. [...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E

[...] On February 10, 2004, MTV announced {{that due to}} the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in which Janet Jackson's breast was exposed on live television, [...] "Toxic" [...] along with other five music videos would be moved from daytime to late-night programming from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. A spokeswoman for MTV announced that [...] "given the particular sensitivity in the culture right now, we're erring on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> for the immediate future." [...] The video was nominated at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards {{in the category of}} Best International Artist Video, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love". It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2004 awards in the categories of Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year, but lost all of them (Rumors spread on internet forums claiming the other winners were rigged due to her none presence that year).

500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

2500|$|The Court of Appeal applied its {{judgment}} in Vellama {{in the later}} case of Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General (2013). Expanding {{on the meaning of}} special damage, the Court noted [...] "that 'special damage' might also possibly encompass those rare and exceptional situations where a public body has breached its public duties in such an egregious manner that the courts are satisfied that {{it would be in the}} public interest to hear it". In the National Federation case, the House of Lords also suggested the theoretical possibility that an ordinary taxpayer might have standing to bring a claim if a public authority had failed to perform its statutory duty, but it would have to be [...] "a most extreme case". Similarly, erring on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> the Court specified that this is [...] "a very narrow avenue which concerns only extremely exceptional instances of very grave and serious breaches of legality... should not in any way be taken as a spurring move towards the surge of public interest litigation".|$|E
2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, we have to work that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E

6000|$|Storms, however, were brewing without. Lady Shrewsbury made open {{complaints}} {{of her husband}} having become one of Mary's many victims, representing herself as an injured wife driven out of her house. She actually in her rage carried the complaint to Queen Elizabeth, who sent down two commissioners to inquire into the matter. They sat in the castle hall, and examined all the attendants, including Richard and his wife. The investigation was extremely painful and distressing, but it was proved that nothing {{could have been more}} correct and guarded than the whole intercourse between the Earl and his prisoner. If he had erred, it had been on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> and severity, though he had always preserved the courteous demeanour of a gentleman, and had been rejoiced to permit whatever indulgences could be granted. If there had been any transgressions of the strict rules, they had been made by the Countess herself and her daughters in the days of their intimacy with the Queen; and the aspersions on the unfortunate Earl were, it was soon evident, merely due to the violent and unscrupulous tongues of the Countess and her daughter Mary. No wonder that Lord Shrewsbury wrote letters in which he termed the lady [...] "his wicked and malicious wife," [...] and expressed his conviction that his son Gilbert's mind had been perverted by her daughter.|$|E
