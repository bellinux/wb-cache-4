5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical prisms and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented contour lines, in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|E

Fortress D found U-710 on the surface {{less than an hour}} later and sank it with depth charges as the U-boat attempted to fight back rather than submerge. U-710 was just 10 miles ahead of the convoy, though probably unaware of its proximity.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Krishnamurti had {{developed}} a strong bond with Annie Besant and came to view her as a surrogate mother. His father, who had initially assented to Besant's legal guardianship of Krishnamurti, was pushed into the background by <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> attention around his son. In 1912 he sued Besant to annul the guardianship agreement. After a protracted legal battle Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and Nitya. As {{a result of this}} separation from family and home Krishnamurti and his brother (whose relationship had always been very close) became more dependent on each other, and in the following years often travelled together.|$|E

500|$|Shea's role {{in resolving}} {{differences}} within NASA, and between NASA and its contractors, {{placed him in}} a position where criticism was inevitable. However, even Shea's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer,Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that [...] "these were Joe Shea's glory days, and whatever <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward." [...] Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft. Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967, the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur.|$|E

50|$|Pressure-swirl {{spray nozzles}} are {{high-performance}} (small drop size) devices with one configuration shown. The stationary core induces a rotary fluid motion which causes <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid in <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> chamber. A film is {{discharged from the}} perimeter of the outlet orifice producing a characteristic hollow cone spray pattern. Air or other surrounding gas is drawn inside <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> chamber to form an air core within <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> liquid. Many configurations of fluid inlets are used to produce this hollow cone pattern depending on the nozzle capacity and materials of construction. The uses of this nozzle include evaporative cooling and spray drying.|$|R

50|$|In fluid dynamics, an eddy is <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> <b>of</b> a {{fluid and}} the reverse current created when the fluid is in a {{turbulent}} flow regime. The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing fluid on the downstream {{side of the}} object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, {{toward the back of}} the obstacle. This phenomenon is naturally observed behind large emergent rocks in swift-flowing rivers.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a three year study on vortex {{enhancement}} of supersonic mixing are discussed. Recent interests in compressible mixing has spurred {{research in the field}} of high speed shear layers. It was established that shear layer growth diminishes with increasing convective Mach number; this Mach number is the relative Mach number of the large scale structures in the shear layer with respect to the Mach numbers {{on either side of the}} shear layer. The purpose was to evaluate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>swirl</b> on compressible mixing rates. Previously analytical and experimental results seem to indicate that swirling flow may significantly modify the shear layer, in some cases resulting in enhanced mixing. Previous studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>swirl</b> on compressible mixing were incomplete since <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>swirl</b> in <b>the</b> flowfield was not quantified. This study was undertaken to conclusively determine <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>swirl</b> on supersonic mixing, including <b>the</b> quantification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swirl.</b> Preliminary results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> modestly enhances <b>the</b> mixing rates...|$|R
