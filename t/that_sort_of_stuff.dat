25|$|There {{are quite}} a few players like me who did really well early in their careers, but didn't {{consolidate}} later on. I guess it is like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

5000|$|Brasil said {{part of the}} band's {{attitude}} and reasoning behind their debut EP title {{is a response to}} the cynicism that runs through the music industry:"There's so much damned cynicism. Yeah, lots of things suck, and there's lots of problems, and I don't suggest you turn your back on those things. But there are plenty of bands that have contempt for their audiences, and they're dark and scary — all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> depressing <b>stuff.</b> Not <b>that</b> there's anything wrong with that. It's just another angle for the whole thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Moore {{has noted}} that she was {{inspired}} by film and television as a child. She has also stated, [...] "I'm stuck in the '70s. I think I'll always {{have that kind of}} influence. Joni Mitchell, Todd Rundgren, Harry Nilsson, McCartney - <b>that's</b> the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I'm really inspired and influenced by". Moore also revealed how her then-husband Ryan Adams had a huge influence on her music, and that he introduced her to heavy metal. [...] "Not that I can necessarily differentiate between speed metal and black metal…" [...] she said. [...] "I'll tolerate it, but I turn it down".|$|R
2500|$|Hunter {{attended}} Taumarunui High School {{and started}} performing as a cabaret singer, Todd later reminisced, [...] "Oh, he was fabulous! He {{was playing in}} cabaret lounges and entertaining all sorts of people, driving a pink Mercedes, all <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> straight out of school!" [...] Hunter also provided drums and vocals {{as a member of}} a band, Quintessence, which performed at a restaurant in Auckland.|$|E
2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what we liked. The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, all <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we tried {{to be a lot more}} imaginative about what we did ... We had no idea what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band. We had our way with girls, bought more clothes and equipment and just enjoyed being stars.|$|E
2500|$|Paine captained Tasmania at Under–15 and Under–17 level, {{along with}} {{being a member of}} its Under–19 team at the age of just fifteen. He was vice-captain of the Australian Under–17, before scoring a first grade century for the University club in Hobart. [...] "He was always the {{smallest}} one playing cricket," [...] Paine's father John said. [...] "We lived in a fairly quiet street and we lived right next to the beach [...] so they used to play a fair bit of beach cricket. We used to have a cricket pitch in our backyard which was the driveway and the next-door neighbours had a turf wicket which the boys used to roll and mow and do all <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> So he had to learn from an early age I suppose to be a bit stronger and a bit more competitive." [...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club. Paine's uncle, Robert Shaw, was an AFL player and coach.|$|E

2500|$|Following England's 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final {{victory over}} Scotland in a tryless Test, Campese led a media {{campaign}} designating England as a boring rugby team. Campese {{said that if}} he played for England, he would insist on playing the flyhalf position because it would be {{the only way he could}} touch the ball. Campese is quoted as saying, 'I wouldn't play for England even if you paid me' and 'Playing <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> boring <b>stuff</b> is a good way to destroy the image of the game. They're all so scared of losing over here they won't try anything.' He further added that 'England would never beat us in the World Cup because they are a bunch of Toffs, and we are convicts.' ...|$|R
500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us <b>that</b> loves this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} not! I didn't mean you were. But I just {{happened}} {{to tell him what}} I wanted to go into when I could see my way to it, and he caught on of his own accord. The fact is," [...] said Fulkerson, [...] "I guess I'd better make a clean breast of it, now I'm at it, Dryfoos wanted to get something for that boy of his to do. He's in railroads himself, and he's in mines and other things, and he keeps busy, and he can't bear to have his boy hanging round the house doing nothing, like as if he was a girl. I told him that the great object of a rich man was to get his son into just that fix, but he couldn't seem to see it, and the boy hated it himself. He's got a good head, and he wanted to study for the ministry when they were all living together out on the farm; but his father had the old-fashioned ideas about that. You know they used to think <b>that</b> any <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> was good enough to make a preacher out of; but they wanted the good timber for business; and so the old man wouldn't let him. You'll see the fellow; you'll like him; he's no fool, I can tell you; and he's going to be our publisher, nominally at first and actually when I've taught him the ropes a little." ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins]:STEWART FIELDNEWBURGH, NEW YORK Monday 19 : 30 Dearest Dottie, I’m sorry I couldn’t {{write you}} a longer letter last night, honey. We were busy with that air raid drill until after taps. And before I forget to tell you, angel, don’t {{tell anyone about}} it will you. <b>That’s</b> just the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> starts these crazy rumors about the V- 3 ’s, or air raids on New York, you know what I mean. And don’t you worry about it, honey, {{it was just a}} routine drill, we’ve had them before. Today was a {{beautiful}} day. I flew Instruments for two hours this morning, knocking off some of the extra time I’ve got to get in the next three weeks. The latest rumor going around now is that we’ll get off the 23 rd regardless of whether we’ve gotten the required extra thirty hours in or not, but it’s strictly a rumor. In the army they fly thick and fast. Another on[e] has it that we’re going to Kansas for advanced, but that’s strickly [sic] stuff. No one knows where we’re going, but I imagine we’ll stay in the East. Gosh I hope it’s not too far away from you, darling, it’s bad enough being only fifty miles away. I’m glad Woody can make it this weekend. I don’t know what time I’m getting off Saturday, but the ground display is open at nine in the morning, so I imagine I’ll have all Saturday off. If I do you can come up early. When I find out I’ll call Mom, and she can get in touch with you. I sure hope this week goes fast and doesn’t drag like the last one. That was the worst yet. The more I see of you, hon, the longer the time seems that we’re apart; the shorter it seems when we’re together. Did you go to work today? I hope your ankle is better, hon. You should have stayed off of it this weekend, you’ve got to take it easy with something like that. I can just see me trying to keep you in bed on a weekend. Hmm—come to think of it, sounds like a pretty good job to me, er—how’s your cold? Well darling, I’ve got some homework to do. I’d like to write all night, sweetheart, but Uncle Sam doesn’t think I ought to. I love you darling, more than any amount of the words in my limited vocabulary could ever tell you. You’re just too sweet 2 ̆ 6 wonderful to be true, and I still say I’m the luckiest guy in the world. Give my best to everyone. I love you and miss you terribly, angel. Goodnight— Judd[Transcription ends...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was Mrs. Packletide's {{suggestion}} that I should write this thing," [...] said Clovis, ignoring the bypaths to fame that Bertie van Tahn was pointing out to him. [...] "You see, Loona Bimberton had a Coronation Ode {{accepted by the}} NEW INFANCY, a paper that has been started {{with the idea of}} making the NEW AGE seem elderly and hidebound. 'So clever of you, dear Loona,' the Packletide remarked when she had read it; 'of course, anyone could write a Coronation Ode, but no one else would have thought of doing it.' Loona protested that these things were extremely difficult to do, and gave us to understand that they were more or less the province of a gifted few. Now the Packletide has been rather decent to me in many ways, a sort of financial ambulance, you know, that carries you off the field when you're hard hit, which is a frequent occurrence with me, and I've no use whatever for Loona Bimberton, so I chipped in and said I could turn out <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> by the square yard if I gave my mind to it. Loona said I couldn't, and we got bets on, and between you and me I think the money's fairly safe. Of course, one of the conditions of the wager is that the thing has to be published in something or other, local newspapers barred; but Mrs. Packletide has endeared herself by many little acts of thoughtfulness to the editor of the SMOKY CHIMNEY, so if I can hammer out anything at all approaching the level of the usual Ode output we ought to be all right. So far I'm getting along so comfortably that I begin to be afraid that I must be one of the gifted few." ...|$|E
