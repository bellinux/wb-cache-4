They can also be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken.

5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E

5|$|Nanofibers of {{dysprosium}} compounds {{have high}} strength {{and a large}} surface area. Therefore, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr3 and NaF to 450°C at 450 bars for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding 400°C without redissolving or aggregating.|$|E
5|$|Polydopamine {{coatings}} {{can form}} on objects {{ranging in size}} from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used,</b> though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using mechanical components which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in electronics {{with the addition of}} transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, capacitors and resistors respectively.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E
5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{for a wide}} variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E
5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, {{it also has the}} benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and {{was found to be}} depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E
