5|$|Nova {{struggled}} {{in his first}} four starts of the 2013 season, in which he failed to pitch past <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> pitching to a 1–1 record and a 6.28 ERA. On April 27, 2013, Nova {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list after an MRI revealed he had inflammation of his right triceps. Nova was activated on May 24, 2013, and demoted to the bullpen. He pitched an immaculate inning on May 29, 2013 against the New York Mets. However, he was demoted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre the next day, as the Yankees decided they wanted Nova to continue to start.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was delayed by rain for 56 minutes.

Contreras started the game for Cuba, and he allowed a two-run double by Baines in the first inning.

He appeared in his first big league game on September 2, against the Baltimore Orioles replacing shortstop Manuel Lee, who had been feeling dizzy and suffering from a stiff neck, {{in the top of the}} fourth inning. In <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> facing pitcher Dave Johnson in his first at-bat, Zosky singled to left field. Later in the game, he was replaced by Rance Mulliniks.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, PCL Manager of the Year Steve Scarsone led the Sounds to a league-best 83–59 {{record and}} the American Conference Southern Division title, sending the team to the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2007. The Sounds lost the American Conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to two, {{including}} a dramatic back-and-forth game seven. At First Tennessee Park, the Sounds added the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, to its between-innings entertainment in 2016. In the middle of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller.

Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then {{stepped up to the plate}} and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Nick Swisher {{walked to}} lead off <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> and {{advanced}} to second on a Melky Cabrera single.

Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{originally}} pitched for the Buffalo Bisons, the Indians' AAA-class {{affiliate in}} the minor leagues. He played with {{them for the first}} three months of the season, with the exception of one game on April 20 against the Kansas City Royals. In 14 appearances with Buffalo, 12 of them starts, Robertson had a 4–5 record with a 7.27 ERA.

5|$|Young {{entered the}} All-Star {{break with the}} major league lead in ERA and {{opponent}} batting average {{as well as an}} undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT Park in San Francisco, California. In <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> of the 5–4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1.

The Giants got one man on base in the top of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning,</b> when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E

5|$|Nick Swisher {{opened the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> with a double and scored on a single to center field by Andy Pettitte. This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since Jim Bouton in 1964. Derek Jeter {{followed}} Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. Cole Hamels then walked Teixeira and was relieved by J.A. Happ. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but Nick Swisher added to the Yankees lead with a solo home run off {{of him in the}} sixth. Werth hit his second solo home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1998, Young was {{involved}} in a combined no-hitter when he pitched into <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> against Moisés E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews. Highland Park won this game, which was the clinching Region II best-of-3 bi-district series game, by the 10-run rule. Young displayed home run power as a senior, and in some games, he played designated hitter. Later that month, Young pitched another no-hitter in another 10-run rule victory, this time against Carthage High School. Young was the starting pitcher at UFCU Disch-Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship game victory against Calallen High School, and he clinched the game with a successful pickoff move. He was selected to the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association 1998 All-State baseball team as well as The Texas Sports Writers Association third-team Class 4A all-state baseball.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{ended the}} inning by {{throwing}} Snider out {{at home to}} keep the score 2–0. Eddie Stanky reached base after a Dodgers error, marking the second error for both teams; after another hit, the inning ended with a strikeout by Thomson. In the fourth inning, three players hit singles but did not score. Snider doubled in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>inning</b> with one out, and a Jackie Robinson single made the score 3–0 for the Dodgers. The inning ended for the Dodgers on a double play, and Don Mueller hit a single {{in the bottom of}} the fifth before the Giants recorded three straight outs. The Dodgers opened up the game in the sixth inning, as Hodges led off with a home run. Billy Cox then reached base on an error and scored on a second error to make the game 5–0. After Labine walked to get on base, there was a rain delay, and play did not resume until that night.|$|E
