Preferential treatment for <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector might be justified if either the output response of subsidies are higher in <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector or if the jobs generated in <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector are “better ” than those in the non-traded sector. I examine these two issues using a simple two sector small open economy model to analyse the first question and input-output analysis to analyse the second. I conclude that there is no compelling argument for lower taxes on <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector. ...|$|R

5|$|From 1878 to 1890, the Anti-Socialist Laws forbade all socialist trade unions. Only small local organizations, which communicated via {{intermediaries}} such as stewards, {{who worked}} illegally or semi-legally, survived. This form of organization {{was easier to}} protect against state repression. After the laws were sunset in 1890, the General Commission of <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> Unions of Germany was founded on November 17 {{at a conference in}} Berlin to centralize the socialist labor movement. In 1892, <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> Union Congress of Halberstadt was held to organize the many local unions under the committee. The localists, 31,000 of whom were represented at the congress, wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during the repressive period. For example, they opposed separate organizations for political and economic matters, such as the party and <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> union. They especially wanted to keep their grassroots democratic structures. They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally, and were wary of bureaucratic structures. The localists' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress, so they refused to join the centralized trade unions, which became known as the Free Trade Unions. They did not renounce social democracy, but rather considered themselves to be an avant-garde within the social democratic movement in Germany.|$|E
