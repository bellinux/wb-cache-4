5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E

25|$|Most Danes {{are active}} cyclists, often using their bikes to commute {{to work or}} to go off on trips at the weekend. With its well-engineered cycle paths, Copenhagen is {{especially}} suited to city cycling. Every day 1.3 million km are cycled in the city, with 36% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle. Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and often quicker way around town than by public transport or car and it is therefore municipal policy {{for the number of}} commuters by bike <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40% by 2012 and 50% by 2015.|$|E

Shane Long inspired Reading to a 2–0 win with both goals, both of them headers from Jimmy Kebe crosses. Reading, 4th, needed to win going into a clash with Birmingham City, 2nd. Reading lost 2–1 and Birmingham went up. Reading need to win <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Premier League at the first attempt, and Sheffield United didn't win against Crystal Palace.

25|$|The Armed Forces {{are today}} funded by {{approximately}} $20.1 billion annually and are presently ranked 74th in size {{compared to the}} world's other armed forces by number of total personnel, and 58th in terms of active personnel, standing at a strength of roughly 68,000, plus 27,000 reservists, 5000 Rangers, and 19,000 supplementary reserves, bringing the total force to approximately 119,000. The number of primary reserve personnel is expected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30,000 by 2020, {{and the number of}} active to at least 70,000. In addition, 5000 rangers and 19,000 supplementary personnel will be serving. If this happens the total strength would be around 124,000. These individuals serve on numerous CF bases located in all regions of the country, and are governed by the Queen's Regulations and Orders and the National Defence Act.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{then returns}} to {{the myth of the}} chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is {{controlled}} by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 143 species of fish, amphibians, birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been seen}} in the park and the number is expected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 200 once the project is completed. More than 85 different kinds of birds, including rare black bittern, cinnamon bittern, black-winged kite, white-bellied sea eagle, pied kingfisher, yellow wagtails, egret, chestnut-winged cuckoo, and black-winged stilt have been spotted by ornithologists in the green expanse. After the northeast monsoon of 2011, painted storks have been spotted in the park after several years. Butterflies, including the rare painted lady and black rajah and blue-tailed green darner dragon fly, have been among those spotted here. Crows, mynahs, blue rock pigeons and water paddybirds walk on the sand near the waterbodies. Non-poisonous snakes, soft and hard shell turtles, painted frogs and green pond frogs can also be seen in the park. The restoration has also improved the quality of water, which according to Central Pollution Control Board norms, is suitable for propagation of wildlife.|$|E
25|$|To attain such speeds, Lockheed Martin {{has been}} collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an {{appropriate}} engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that {{has the ability to}} accelerate from standstill to Mach6.0 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. The challenge is to design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at zero speed and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, being able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a scramjet engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between.|$|E

500|$|The next {{challenge}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair faced was the tonnage cap {{set by the}} treaty. Carriers were {{to be no more}} than 27,000 tons. An exception, spearheaded by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and added to the treaty, allowed capital ships under conversion <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 33,000 tons, an increase of 6000 tons.

500|$|... "The Mission" [...] {{then looks}} at how Jesus may have been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time.

Jesus told lepers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and ate with sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E
