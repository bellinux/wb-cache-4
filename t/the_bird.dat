5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{starling}} (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> has a powerful bite.|$|E

Alpha reappears, imprisoning Amy and <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> on Eggman's airship the Egg Carrier. Another Eggman robot, E-102 Gamma, orders Amy to give <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> to him; she refuses, asking him why he wants it. He does not know, and changes his mind when she tells him he is missing out on love. E-102 Gamma lets them leave and, touched, Amy becomes his friend before she escapes into the ship's interior. On the deck, Eggman confronts her and grabs the bird's Chaos Emerald. Sonic and Gamma appear, and when Sonic tries to destroy Gamma Amy defends him. Sonic agrees to spare Gamma, and Amy leaves with Tails. She later sees a photo of <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and its parents (whom Eggman has also stolen) in its necklace. When Amy looks {{for them in the}} jungle, she again finds the Egg Carrier. The bird's parents emerge on the deck; Alpha appears, and injures Amy's bird.

5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
