The first part of this paper deals with the theoretical approach to solve the char-acter of flows close to a boundary which is caused by impingement of jets on a normalboundary. A theoretical consideration for the boundary layer growth on the normalboundary in the various cases of two and three dimensional jets, at submerged and non-submerged conditions is described with the aid of the results of some experiments. Inthe above considerations, the boundary layer growth in the vicinity of impingement ofjets is disclosed.
