5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 <b>tarps</b> to homeowners.|$|E
5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} {{and other}} wastes with concrete to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under <b>tarps</b> on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for relief workers to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and <b>tarps</b> to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra.|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis {{invasion}} of eukaryotic host cells is facilitated, in part, by the type III secreted effector protein, <b>Tarp.</b> The role of <b>Tarp</b> in chlamydiae entry of host cells {{is supported by}} molecular approaches that examined recombinant <b>Tarp</b> or <b>Tarp</b> effectors expressed within heterologous systems. A major limitation {{in the ability to}} study the contribution of <b>Tarp</b> to chlamydial {{invasion of}} host cells was the prior absence of genetic tools for chlamydiae. Based on our knowledge of <b>Tarp</b> domain structure and function along with the introduction of genetic approaches in C. trachomatis, we hypothesized that <b>Tarp</b> function could be disrupted in vivo by the introduction of dominant negative mutant alleles. We provide evidence that transformed C. trachomatis produced epitope tagged <b>Tarp,</b> which was secreted into the host cell during invasion. We examined the effects of domain specific <b>Tarp</b> mutations on chlamydial invasion and growth and demonstrate that C. trachomatis clones harboring engineered <b>Tarp</b> mutants lacking either the actin binding domain or the phosphorylation domain had reduced levels of invasion into host cells. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for the critical role of <b>Tarp</b> in C. trachomatis pathogenesis and indicate that chlamydial invasion of host cells can be attenuated via the introduction of engineered dominant negative type three effectors...|$|R
5|$|Following the storm, a government-endorsed {{disaster}} relief program was initiated {{to mitigate the}} developing humanitarian crisis in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 malnourished children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona {{as part of the}} program, which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by March 6, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000. Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe. United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute <b>tarps,</b> while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic <b>tarps</b> and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using <b>tarps</b> to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5000|$|However, it {{had been}} argued that the Treasury lacked the {{statutory}} authority to direct <b>TARP</b> funds to the automakers, since <b>TARP</b> is limited to “financial institutions" [...] under Section 102 of the <b>TARP.</b> It was also argued that providing <b>TARP</b> funds to automaker's financing operations, such as GMAC, runs counter to the intent of Congress for limiting <b>TARP</b> funds to true [...] "financial institutions".

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided <b>tarps</b> to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.|$|E

5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and <b>tarps.</b> Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, {{or on the}} {{shoulder}} of a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out <b>tarps.</b> <b>Tarps</b> can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 <b>tarps</b> per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E
