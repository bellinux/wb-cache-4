At <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> he lost his lower right leg after being {{run over by a}} car on the footpath. He took up skiing because his aunt and uncle owned a chalet in the Snowy Mountains at Smiggin Holes, New South Wales.

5|$|Bonstelle's mother, who {{herself had}} wanted to be an actress, home-schooled her in reading, writing, singing, dancing, and even in reciting Shakespeare. Jessie's first public {{performance}} was singing temperance songs in church at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years. Helen gave her daughter a passion for acting by often taking her to theaters in nearby Rochester. Around the age of ten Jessie auditioned for critic Thomas Keane, and with his encouragement she left on tour with a production of Bertha, the Beautiful Sewing Machine Girl, a melodrama. After returning home from California she briefly studied at Nazareth Academy, a convent school in Rochester. In 1886 she returned to the stage, working for local opera house owner Edward D. Stair and touring in his productions.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two.</b> Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E

5|$|Constance of Hauteville (1128–1163) was {{the ruling}} Princess of Antioch from 1130 to 1163. She {{was the only}} child of Bohemond II of Antioch by his wife, Alice of Jerusalem. Constance succeeded her father, who fell in battle, at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> {{although}} his cousin, Roger II of Sicily, laid claim to Antioch. Her mother assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance's grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After he died in 1131, Alice again tried {{to take control of the}} government, but the Antiochene barons acknowledged the right of her brother-in-law, Fulk of Anjou, to rule as regent for Constance.|$|E
5|$|Crosby {{was born}} in the Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on August 7, 1987, to Troy and Trina (née Forbes) Crosby. Crosby's jersey number (87) and 2007 {{contract}} signing ($8.7million per year) reflect his birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour, and has a younger sister, Taylor. His father was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Troy played in the 1985 Memorial Cup and had been drafted 240th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1984, but never played at the NHL level. Growing up, Crosby admired Steve Yzerman and, like his father, was a Canadiens fan. Crosby began playing hockey by himself in his basement at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years, shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a longstanding misconception that he was actually practising with the dryer; he learned to skate at three.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{was born}} in Kensington, London, the son of poet Cecil Day-Lewis and English actress Jill Balcon. His father, who {{was born in}} Ballintubbert, County Laois, Ireland, was of Protestant Anglo-Irish and English background, lived in England from <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> and later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Day-Lewis's mother was Jewish; her {{ancestors}} were Jewish immigrants to England from Latvia and Poland. His maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, was the head of Ealing Studios. Two years after his birth, his family moved to Croom's Hill, Greenwich, south-east London, where Day-Lewis grew up along with his older sister, Tamasin, who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef.|$|E

5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and slice of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
50|$|Jesús Castellanos died on May 29, 1912, at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 33 of typhoid fever. He {{left behind}} {{his wife and}} two children, Julio and Alicia, who {{at the time of his}} death were <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years old and ten days old, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> months. On 24 March 1950, {{his eyes were}} infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so {{he was taken to}} an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. The mural {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two.</b> The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that the Apple Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{was born}} on 2 March 1991, in Stockholm, Sweden, to Annika and Peter Josefson. He is the {{youngest}} of three brothers. At <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two,</b> Josefson began skating and joined IK Göta {{at the age of}} five. His older brothers had played for the same club. He played with Hammarby IF for a year before he was acquired by Djurgårdens IF at the age of ten, playing for the 1991 team. He also played football until the age of 13, before deciding to focus entirely on hockey. Josefson attended high school at Vittra Gymnasium in Sweden while playing for Djurgården.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{examined}} latent growth in 731 young children’s inhibitory control from <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> to four years, and whether demographic characteristics or parenting behaviors {{were related to}} initial levels and growth in inhibitory control. As {{part of an ongoing}} longitudinal evaluation of the family check-up, children’s inhibitory control was assessed yearly at <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> to four years. Inhibitory control was initially low and increased linearly to <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> four years. High levels of harsh parenting and male gender were associated with low initial status in inhibitory control. High levels of parental positive behavior support were associated with faster growth. Extreme family poverty and African-American ethnicity were also associated with slower growth. The results highlight parenting as a target for early interventions in contexts of high socioeconomic risk...|$|R
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly {{as a consequence of}} his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing children under <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E
