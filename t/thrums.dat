40|$|Heterostyly in Primula is {{characterized}} by the development of long-styled pin and short-styled <b>thrum</b> flowers, with anthers midway down the corolla tube in pin flowers, and at its mouth in <b>thrum</b> flowers. Other differences include pollen size and stigmatic papillae length. Several linked genes at the S locus control these differences. • In this study we have analyzed pin and <b>thrum</b> flowers through the temporal development of heteromorphy. • These studies indicate that the S locus linked genes that orchestrate heteromorphic flower development act in coordination, but with different temporal and spatial dynamics. • Style length is differentiated by longer style cells in pin than <b>thrum.</b> However, our studies on cell shape and size within the corolla tube show that a different mechanism mediates the dissimilar elevation of anthers between pin and <b>thrum</b> types. These studies have also revealed that upper corolla tube cells in <b>thrum</b> flowers are wider than those in pin flowers. This results in a larger corolla tube mouth in <b>thrum</b> flowers and represents a new and previously undocumented heteromorphic variation between pin and <b>thrum</b> flowers. © The Authors (2006) ...|$|R

40|$|Nectar robbers {{are thought}} rarely to {{pollinate}} flowers, {{especially those with}} sexual organs hidden within corollas. In this study, we examined whether robbers pollinate flowers of distylous Primula secundiflora. Distylous plants have two floral morphs. Pin flowers have long styles and short stamens, and <b>thrum</b> flowers have short styles and long stamens. Flowers of P. secundiflora were commonly robbed by bumble-bees, and robbing holes were always situated {{between high and low}} sexual organs for both floral morphs. We observed that pollen grains of pin flowers were removed while <b>thrum</b> flowers received fresh pollen grains immediately after flowers were robbed. We manipulated flowers so that only nectar robbers could visit them. This resulted in 98 per cent of <b>thrum</b> flowers and 6 per cent of pin flowers setting fruit, and seed number per <b>thrum</b> fruit was also significantly higher than per pin fruit. Our findings suggest that nectar robbers transfer pollen from pin flowers to <b>thrum</b> flowers effectively, and consequently increase male fitness of the pin morph and female fitness of the <b>thrum</b> morph. Such asymmetrical pollen flow caused by nectar robbers may act as an important selective agent in floral fitness and evolution of distyly...|$|R

5000|$|Supergenes have cis-effects due to {{multiple}} loci (which may be within a gene, or {{within a single}} gene's regulatory region), and tight linkage. They are classically polymorphic, and different elements code for different fitness effects which combine to form a coherent or epistatic whole. The two classic supergenes are (1) the Primula heterostyly locus, which controls [...] "pin" [...] and [...] "thrum" [...] types, and (2) the locus controlling Batesian mimetic polymorphism in Papilio memnon butterflies. For example, pin and <b>thrum</b> morphs of Primula have effects on genetic compatibility (pin style x <b>thrum</b> pollen, or <b>thrum</b> style x pin pollen matings are successful, while pin x pin, and <b>thrum</b> x <b>thrum</b> matings are rarely successful due to pollen-style incompatibility), and have different style length, anther height in the corolla tube, pollen size, and papilla size on the stigma. Each of these effects is controlled by a different locus in the same supergene, but recombinants are occasionally found with traits combining those of [...] "pin" [...] and [...] "thrum" [...] morphs.|$|R

40|$|Persicaria chinensis var. chinensis is {{a native}} variety in Malaysia and found in the tropics growing in lowland and lower montane forests. Growth habit and {{morphological}} differences were observed between the highland and lowland varieties. The anthesis of the highland wild population was at 0600 – 0730 hours whereas that of the lowland variety was at 0745 – 0930 hours. The anther is tetrasporangiate and the wall development conforms to the Monocotyledonous type. Cytokinesis in the microspore mother cells is simultaneous forming tetrahedral and decussate tetrads in the highland variety and mostly tetrahedral tetrads in the lowland variety. The mature pollen grains are shed at the three-cell stage. The ovule is orthotropous, bitegmic and crassinucellate and the micropyle is formed by both the outer and inner integuments. The development of the embryo sac conforms to the monosporic Polygonum type. An occurrence of twin eggs within an ovule was observed in the lowland variety. In the highland variety, {{the development of the}} endosperm is ab initio Nuclear type. The highland variety is heterostylous; pin flowers have taller style, shorter filaments, less thick and less wide stigma than the <b>thrum</b> flower. The number of pollen grains in a pin flower is higher than that in a <b>thrum</b> flower. The pollen grains of the <b>thrum</b> flowers are bigger than those of the pin flowers. The pin and <b>thrum</b> pollen grains are 3 -colpate, medium-sized, suboblate to oblate and have reticulate exine with thick, narrow muri and free clavae in the deep lumina. The lowland variety is observed to have only <b>thrum</b> flower. They have shorter style, longer filaments, thicker and wider stigma than those of the highland <b>thrum</b> flowers. The pollen grains of the lowland variety are bigger than those of the highland <b>thrum</b> flowers.

40|$|This study explores whether {{ecological}} factors, such as pollinators and pollen flow, or {{variation in}} pollen and ovule development {{account for the}} observed differences (approximately twofold) in the reproductive output of pin and <b>thrum</b> individuals of Erythroxylum havanense. The importance of ecological factors was assessed by means of comparison of the identity of pollinators and the rates of flower visitation, and by performing controlled hand pollinations and measurements of fruit set. In addition, we described the pollen and ovule development of <b>thrum</b> and pin individuals. Our results indicate that pollinators of E. havanense do not distinguish between floral morphs. The differences in fruit set between pin and <b>thrum</b> plants held even after hand pollination and, therefore, the observed differences in reproductive output between floral morphs of E. havanense cannot be {{explained in terms of}} asymmetrical pollen flow. There were no differences in the pattern of gynoecium development between the pin and <b>thrum</b> morphs, however androecium development showed marked differences between the morphs, and there was a resemblance between the developmental pathways leading to male sterility of the <b>thrum</b> morph of E. havanense with that of species with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) ...|$|R
