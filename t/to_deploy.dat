5|$|Deployment without weapons: On {{a number}} of occasions, {{soldiers}} were asked <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials. Early in the deployment Lieutenants Burchell and Stanner were asked by UNHCR to conduct an unarmed reconnaissance, but permission was refused. Near the election, Australian military electoral monitors were asked <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> in civilian clothes without weapons.|$|E
5|$|Machine guns: The UN {{required}} the Australians <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> without the belt-fed M60 machine gun, the standard section-level automatic weapon at the time. Instead, the contingent was required <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> with World War II-vintage Bren light machine guns, since these used only a 30-round magazine (the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition).|$|E

5|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at Ypres by the German Army. The effect on the allies was devastating because the {{existing}} gas masks were difficult <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> and had not been broadly distributed.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that the 16th Sustainment Brigade would be deployed to Iraq in summer of 2008. It would be part of a force of 8,000 soldiers from US Army Europe <b>to</b> <b>deploy.</b> The brigade was just one of over 20 major units from Europe <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> to the Middle East in 2008; most of these units came from the 21st Theater Sustainment Command and V Corps. Throughout the Spring of 2008, the unit prepared for the deployment by conducting training exercises in Germany.|$|E

5|$|Although Thảo's last plot failed, his {{activities}} in 1965 {{and the resultant}} infighting led {{to a series of}} internal purges within the ARVN. Amid the instability, the Vietcong made strong gains across the country throughout the year. In response to the deteriorating military situation, the Americans began <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> combat troops to South Vietnam in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Due to the episodic {{nature of}} the Axis attacks and the {{relatively}} small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the Allies were forced <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not {{have a significant impact on}} the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb.

5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1940, {{ships of}} the RAN, {{at the request}} of the Admiralty, began <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> to the Mediterranean Sea to take part in the Battle of the Mediterranean against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. In September 1939, the Admiralty and the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board agreed <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> the RAN Destroyer Flotilla outside the Australia Station; the five ships of what was to become known as the Scrap Iron Flotilla arrived at Malta in mid-December. HMAS Sydney {{deployed}} in May 1940 and was later joined by Hobart. When Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the Australian warships made up five of the twenty-two Allied destroyers and one of the five modern light cruisers on station in the Mediterranean. The RAN then offered the services of Australia to the Admiralty, and was accepted. When Australia arrived in the Mediterranean, the RAN had sent nearly the entire combat fleet to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving Australia open to possible attack.|$|E
5|$|However, the U.S. did {{not have}} enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald's Conservative {{government}} {{then fell}} from {{power over the}} Pacific Scandal, {{and was replaced by}} the Liberal administration of Alexander Mackenzie, who placed more credence on Morris's reports and had his own moral concerns about the whiskey trade. These worries were amplified by calls from Washington for Ottawa to secure the frontier and so prevent American Indians from purchasing whiskey in Canada. Mackenzie initially suggested sending a joint Canadian-United States military expedition, but, after the Governor General and others noted the serious implications of inviting the United States Army <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> into Canadian territory, he instead agreed <b>to</b> <b>deploy</b> the new mounted police to carry out the operation. Another 150 men were recruited in eastern Canada and sent west by rail through the United States to rendezvous with {{the first part of the}} force at Fort Dufferin.|$|E
