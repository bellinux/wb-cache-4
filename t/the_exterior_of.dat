40|$|The idea {{to compute}} <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a finite group G started in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a {{group is the}} {{probability}} that two randomly selected elements x and y in the group such that x ∧ y = 1 and denoted as P̂(G). However, {{in order to examine}} <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> a finite group, the nonabelian tensor square and some homological functors of the group must first be explored and determined. The homological functors that are used in determining <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> G are ∇(G) and <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> square <b>of</b> G. In this research, the nonabelian tensor square, ∇(G) and <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> square <b>of</b> symmetric group of order six are determined. Then, <b>the</b> <b>exterior</b> degree <b>of</b> symmetric group of order six is computed...|$|R
