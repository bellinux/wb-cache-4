25|$|While Clausius {{based his}} {{definition}} on a reversible process, {{there are also}} irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> isolated system and closed system is that heat may not flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 and 2008, {{people in}} {{southern}} Kalinga around Binuluan spoke of an 'eruption' at Sugo-oc in 1986 or 1987.

Flatpak is also supported by default, and support for Ubuntu's snaps can also be added. Fedora uses Delta RPM when updating installed packages to provide Delta update. A Delta RPM contains <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> old and new version of a package.

The active Colour has always a guard of two officers, while a traditional Colour is borne without one. The military oath is always given {{in the presence of the}} active Colour of the unit.|$|E

500|$|The {{physics of}} quantum {{mechanics}} was thereby reduced to the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the uncertainty principle, according to which {{the determination of the}} position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the non-commutativity of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.

500|$|The term throffer is a {{portmanteau}} {{of threat}} and offer. It {{was first used}} by Canadian philosopher Hillel Steiner in a 1974–75 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society article. Steiner had considered a quote from the 1972 film The Godfather: [...] "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". While the line seemed to be amusingly ironic (because a threat is being made, not an offer), Steiner was unsatisfied that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> offer and a threat was merely that one promises to confer a benefit {{and the other a}} penalty. He thus coined throffer to describe the [...] "offer" [...] in The Godfather. One prominent thinker who adopted the term was political scientist Michael Taylor, and his work on throffers has been frequently cited.|$|E

500|$|Y and H {{cylinder}} valves {{have two}} outlets, {{each with its}} own valve, allowing two regulators to be connected to the cylinder. If one regulator [...] "freeflows", which is a common failure mode, or ices up, which can happen in water below about 5°C, its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> H-valve and a Y-valve is that the Y-valve body splits into two posts roughly 90° to each other and 45° from the vertical axis, looking like a Y, while an H-valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket, with the valve posts parallel and vertical, which looks a bit like an H. Y-valves are also known as [...] "slingshot valves" [...] due to their appearance.|$|E

In August 2015, he criticizes the poor slate {{of candidates for}} the Republican nomination for president, calling them the [...] "GOP clown car". Taibbi begins to change his views after personally visiting speeches by Trump at campaign stops in the beginning portion of 2016. In an election dispatch from September 2016, Taibbi writes, [...] "I still don’t think Trump really has a chance, but we’re sure headed towards a scary ending." [...] In October, he states, [...] "Trump can’t win. Our national experiment can’t end because one ageing narcissist got bored of sex and food. Not even America deserves that." [...] The book castigates Republican tactics of engaging in culture wars, writing they are, [...] "taking {{advantage of the fact}} that their voters didn’t know <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> elitist and the actual elite, between a snob and an oligarch." [...] Taibbi documents how Trump's inflammatory campaign rhetoric, often over social media including Twitter, garnered him increased publicity which led to increased influence.|$|E
500|$|Moments {{before being}} {{propelled}} off the table, the athlete undergoes a sudden increase in g-force {{due to the}} curvature – or 'compression' – of {{the bottom of the}} inrun. They then initiate a very powerful, explosive jump that requires great leg strength. At this instant, the skis are opened up into a horizontal [...] "V" [...] angle, the legs are straightened and spread apart, and the athlete adopts their own unique aerodynamic flying position in what is called the 'transition'; all of this taking place in only a tenth of a second. Timing is crucial and there is next to no margin for error at this phase: a jump that begins too early or late off the table can mean <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> excellent, average or poor effort. Each athlete has their own method of generating as much inrun speed as possible, depending on such intricacies as crouch depth, hip and knee angle, arm placement, or how far the torso is positioned over the knees. Body weight is also a factor (see power-to-weight ratio), which has led to some athletes' health becoming a concern over the years.|$|E
