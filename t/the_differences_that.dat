5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E

25|$|The first {{theory of}} the origin of Ukrainian {{language}} was suggested in Imperial Russia {{in the middle of the}} 18th century by Mikhail Lomonosov. This theory posits the existence of a common language spoken by all East Slavic people in the time of the Rus'. According to Lomonosov, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> subsequently developed between Great Russian and Ukrainian (which he referred to as Little Russian) could be explained by the influence of the Polish and Slovak languages on Ukrainian and the influence of Uralic languages on Russian from the 13th to the 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|In recent research, a {{group of}} {{subjects}} was faced with remembering a list of items and then measured when trying to recall said items. The evoked potentials and hemodynamic activity measured during encoding were found to exhibit reliable differences between subsequently recalled and not recalled items. This effect has been termed the subsequent memory effect (SME). This difference in these specific brain regions determines whether or not an item is recalled. A study by Fernandez et al. has shown that <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> predict recall appear both as a negative deflection in the rhinal cortex of an event-related potential (ERP) 400ms after stimulus exposure, and as a positive hippocampal ERP beginning 800ms after stimulus onset. This means that recall only occurs if these two brain regions (rhinal cortex and hippocampus) are activated in synchrony.|$|E

500|$|To {{give the}} Odyssey an unnatural ghostship feeling of solitude, many wide angle shots and VisFX matte {{extension}} were used with no additional music. Robert C.

The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> characters have gone through.

500|$|The {{estimation}} of stature by anthropologists {{is based on}} a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds. Stature is given as a range of possible values, in centimeters, and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg. The three bones that are used are the femur, the tibia, and the fibula. In addition to the leg bones, the bones of the arm, the humerus, ulna, and radius can be used. The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual. Sex, ancestry, and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height, if possible. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> occur between populations, sexes, and age groups. By knowing all the variables associated with height, a more accurate estimate can be made. For example, a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is [...] A female of the same ancestry would use the formula, [...] It is also important to note an individual's approximate age when determining stature. This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages. After age 30, a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade.|$|E

500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is well thought out and you really {{feel as if you}} made some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was not as good as its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>that</b> set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person just starting out in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E
