5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

40|$|What is fun? How is it {{distinct}} from happiness or pleasure? How {{do we know}} when we are having it? This book {{is the first to}} provide a comprehensive sociological account of this taken for granted social phenomenon. Fincham investigates areas such as our memories <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> in childhood, <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> we have as adults, our muted experiences <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> at work and our lived experiences <b>of</b> having <b>fun.</b> Using first-hand accounts and a new approach to interpreting <b>fun,</b> <b>the</b> paradox <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> as not serious or unimportant whilst at the same time essential for a happy life is exposed. Addressing questions of control, transgression and the primacy of social relationships in <b>fun,</b> <b>The</b> Sociology <b>of</b> <b>Fun</b> is intended to provoke discussion about how we want to have fun and who determines <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> we have...|$|R
25|$|A 2006 {{study by}} the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries tracked the motivations of anglers on the Red River.

Use as food was not investigated as a motive.|$|E
25|$|Racing Club {{has also}} always defended the amateur {{spirit of the}} game and of sports in general. The {{creation}} of the Challenge Yves du Manoir responded to this ideal in a period (late 1920s-early 1930s) where French rugby was marred by violence and creeping professionalism. Yves du Manoir symbolised the romantic side of rugby, its carefree dimension, le jeu pour le jeu (playing for <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> playing).|$|E
25|$|Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only {{interested}} in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation.

Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.|$|E

25|$|Terry Teachout, National Review (August 12, 2002) — Chaykin and Hutton {{are as good}} {{in tandem}} as they are separately, for they {{understand}} that the Wolfe books are less mystery stories than domestic comedies, the continuing saga of two iron-willed codependents engaged in an endless game of one-upmanship. … At least half <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> the Wolfe books comes from {{the way in which}} Stout plays this struggle for laughs, and Chaykin and Hutton make the most of it, sniping at each other with naughty glee.|$|E
25|$|The sum {{paid out}} was {{so large that}} {{it was said that}} the crew of the ships {{involved}} roamed around Portsmouth with 'bank notes stuck in their hats, buying watches for <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> frying them, and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold-laced hat should be cobbed, so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up, but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace.' Each seaman involved received £182 4s 9¾d, the equivalent of ten years pay.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For <b>The</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>Of</b> It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely for <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from {{the members of the}} court.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S.

An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious".

500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I {{got a kick out}} of live television. The spontaneity was <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|Browder {{considered}} Mitchell {{to be more}} restrained {{than his}} former Farscape character John Crichton, who had higher emotional stakes and was [...] "literally going insane {{through the process of}} the series. Mitchell's focus was on his job, and on <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> his job. But Crichton's focus was on survival, and on the creation of a family." [...] Crichton was also the center of the Farscape narrative, whereas the SG-1 characters serve as nearly equal parts in an ensemble show. Browder did not view Mitchell as a substitute for Richard Dean Anderson's role of Colonel Jack O'Neill, the undisputed SG-1 team leader from seasons 1 through 7. While O'Neill's approach was [...] "normally couched in sarcastic terms" [...] in later years, Mitchell is [...] "more optimistic and has a wry sense about him that's not so much sarcastic".|$|E
