On page 15 and 16 of its technical notes for accounting of scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions related to the production of purchased electricity), CDP explains how companies can do more. “Ecolabels are a way for companies to do more with their purchases. EKOenergy, mentioned by the GHG protocol Scope 2 guidance, is such an option: it is a mark of quality which comes on top of <b>tracking</b> <b>certificates.</b> Electricity sold with the EKOenergy label fulfills strict environmental criteria and raises funds for new renewable energy projects. Involvement, transparency and ‘deeds not words’ are important principles of EKOenergy’s work.” ...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic level}} for track access for Network Rail is the Personal <b>Track</b> Safety <b>certificate</b> (PTS) {{as defined by}} the railway safety {{standards}} NR/L2/CTM/021. These levels of certification only assess the individual’s ability to work safely in the track environment. This means that the individual is able to respond and correctly react to circumstances which may arise in this potentially dangerous environment. Persons therefore should not have any condition or be taking any medication that may lead to sudden incapacity, loss of consciousness, dizziness, impairment of awareness, concentration, balance, coordination, or any significant limitation of mobility or impairment of hearing and vision. Persons with minor medical conditions (e.g. colour blind) may still be issued a PTS - though the card will have an indicator, a blue circle, to inform the Controller of Site Safety (COSS) to that person's ailment. Similarly, those who have only recently got their PTS certificate will have a green square on their card to indicate their 'new' status, as well as a blue hard hat instead of the usual white hard hat.|$|R

The task continued with codingof death certificates, as introduced in CLEF eHealth 2016. This large-scale classification task consisted of extracting {{causes of death}} as coded in the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD 10). The languages offered for the task this year were English and French. Participant systems were evaluated against a blind reference standardof 31, 690 death certificates in the French dataset and 6, 665 certificates in the English dataset using Precision, Recall and F-measure. In total, eleven teams participated: 10 teams submitted runs for the English dataset and 9 for the French dataset.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{experiences and}} {{findings from the}} public private partnership (PPP) project ‘Blockchain for Agrifood’ that was started in March 2017. The project aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the blockchain technology (BCT) and its implications for agrifood, especially how it can impact specific aspects of supply chains and what is needed to apply BCT in agrifood chains. A second aim of this project is to conceptualise and develop a proof of concept in an application based on a use case concerning table grapes from South Africa where BCT could be applied. This has been done by building a demonstrator that keeps <b>track</b> of different <b>certificates</b> involved in the table grapes supply chain. The code of this demonstrator is published at Github. Furthermore, the project explored issues regarding the relevance, applicability and implications of BCT for the agrifood sector through literature study and stakeholder consultation...|$|R
