5|$|The {{history of}} Sejanus and Drusus dated back {{to at least}} AD 15. That year a mutiny had broken out among legions posted in Pannonia and Germania. While his adopted son Germanicus {{restored}} order in Germania, Tiberius' biological son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in Pannonia, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian cohorts. In part due to what the soldiers believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> omens, Drusus quickly managed to restore stability in the army, and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the winter barracks. Despite this success, the following years witnessed a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus.|$|E

The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district.

Ten years later, facing one of frequent Turkish (Ottoman) attacks to the territory of Slovakia, the fortifications were improved under the leadership of the military engineer Josef Priami of the Imperial Court in Vienna. Further improvements of the fortifications followed around 1673. They ended with the final defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 1683. In 1703, barracks were built in the north-east of the site and the armoury was turned into barracks too. The present-day Vienna Gate was constructed {{on the occasion of the}} coronation of Emperor Charles VI in 1712 and it was used as the main entrance to the castle site since then.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{judicial}} review can be excluded through executive decision remains a live issue because the 1989 {{amendments to the}} ISA reverted the law on {{judicial review}} applicable to the ISA to the date that Lee Mau Seng was decided. However, Lee Mau Seng appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> law since it was overruled by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Furthermore, as a High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng {{may not be the}} final word on judicial review of action taken under the ISA. In addition, if detainees allege procedural impropriety, this allows a court to consider if there are procedural defects in the Executive's decision-making process, such as the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. Finally, ouster clauses are not barriers to judicial review in modern administrative law because courts can still step in to prevent jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E

In 2011, the band reached number 33 with Forevermore and number 81 with Live at Donington 1990, in 2013 they reached number 67 with Made in Japan, and in 2015 they reached number 18 with The Purple Album.|$|E
25|$|The {{armed forces}} {{that won the}} American Revolution {{consisted}} of the standing Continental Army created by the Continental Congress, together with regular French army and naval forces and various state and regional militia units. In opposition, the British forces consisted of a mixture of the standing British Army, Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries. Following the Revolution, the United States was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Federalists argued that this government had an unworkable division of power between Congress and the states, which caused military weakness, as the standing army was reduced to as few as 80 men. They considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> {{that there was no}} effective federal military crackdown on an armed tax rebellion in western Massachusetts known as Shays' Rebellion. Anti-federalists on the other hand took the side of limited government and sympathized with the rebels, many of whom were former Revolutionary War soldiers. Subsequently, the Constitutional Convention proposed in 1787 to grant Congress exclusive power to raise and support a standing army and navy of unlimited size. Anti-federalists objected to the shift of power from the states to the federal government, but as adoption of the Constitution became more and more likely, they shifted their strategy to establishing a bill of rights that would put some limits on federal power.|$|E

25|$|After leaving RKO, Marcus only {{worked on}} a single film during the {{remainder}} of 1941 and all of 1942. In early 1942 he was the associate producer on The Spoilers for Universal Pictures, which starred John Wayne, Randolph Scott, and Marlene Dietrich. Later that year, in August, Marcus signed a long-term contract to produce for 20th Century Fox. His first assignment at 20th Century was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Bad</b> Men of Texas, written by Frank Gruber, however that project {{does not appear to}} have been completed. His first completed project for Fox was Crash Dive, which he finished producing after Milton Sperling was called up to join the United States Marine Corps in September 1942. This was followed by They Came to Blow Up America, a spy thriller starring George Sanders, for which Marcus' production quality received positive reviews. In June 1943, Marcus resigned from 20th-Century, to work for Edward Small at his independent production company. The final two films he produced for Fox, The Dancing Masters, a Laurel and Hardy comedy, and Roger Touhy, Gangster, a gangster film with Preston Foster in the titular role, were not released until after his departure from the studio. His tenure with Small was short-lived, however, and he resigned in March 1944, due to an unspecified illness. At the end of 1944, he co-produced, with Bert Gilroy, a musical short for his old studio, RKO, Songs of the Colleges. In 1946 he rejoined forces with Small, this time along with Joseph Fields, in forming an independent production company. In 1946 Marcus produced a compilation film for Astor Pictures. Titled Hollywood Bound, it consisted of three film shorts featuring Betty Grable, which Marcus had produced in the 1930s. In early 1947, Marcus produced his final film, Lost Honeymoon, which was written by Fields. Starring Franchot Tone, Ann Richards, and Tom Conway, the picture was produced and released by Eagle-Lion Films.|$|E

All of the major warships were eventually topped up to at least 60 per cent of their fuel capacity.

500|$|Super Mario Kart {{has been}} {{credited}} with inventing the [...] "kart racing" [...] subgenre of video gaming and soon after its release several other developers attempted to duplicate its success. In 1994, {{less than two years}} after the release of Super Mario Kart, Sega released Sonic Drift; a kart racing game featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Also in 1994 Ubisoft released Street Racer, a kart racing game for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis which included a four player mode not present in Super Mario Kart. Apogee Software released Wacky Wheels for PC. Future games that followed in the mould of Super Mario Kart include South Park Rally, Konami Krazy Racers, Diddy Kong Racing, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and several racing games in the Crash Bandicoot series. Response to the karting games released since Super Mario Kart has been mixed, with GameSpot describing them as tending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> while 1UP.com notes that countless developers have tried to improve upon the Mario Kart formula without success.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews.

[...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E
