5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need for the road to be {{constructed}} date back to the construction of Switch Island junction, with numerous public consultations held throughout the years to ascertain public support and opinion on the need for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> alignment it would take. The consultations have produced favourable responses from the majority of respondents, with several different alignment suggestions being proposed over the years.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees {{in the path of}} the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along the course and caught the leaders on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He made a move in the Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and {{which led to the}} formation of a lead group. The group came to the line twenty seconds after the winner, with Cancellara managing to sprint to a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, {{for the first}} time in his life. He ordered Harpaz's company, which had the most casualties, to go first, and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained on top of a sand dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> railway through culverts. On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{construction of a}} culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, {{and so there is}} still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E

5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, End of <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled {{that they could not}} build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 December, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hill 1542 and Hill 1419. The {{tenacious}} Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> peaks when the convoy passed 3/7's position by the afternoon. With Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni while the 89th Division rushed south towards Koto-ri. The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocious fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks. The fighting lasted well into {{the morning of}} 2 December until all the Marines managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 30, the 9th Infantry Regiment led the {{withdrawal}} by attacking the roadblock. Four tanks were first sent down <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chinese held their fire. Encouraged by this development, Colonel Sloane ordered the 9th Infantry Regiment to press forward, but Chinese machine gun and mortar fire immediately stopped the advance at 9 a.m. The ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment attached to the 2nd Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the US 9th Infantry Regiment, but it was routed by friendly fire. With no contacts between the American commands and the British units, the Middlesex Regiment advanced to {{the south end of}} the valley without attacking the roadblock. Believing that the roadblock was short and the British were attacking up the road, Keiser ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to run through the blockade at 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Road {{was created}} in the early 20th century {{connecting}} Chicago with Fort Sheridan north of the city. Both <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fort were named in honor of Philip Sheridan, Union general during the Civil War. Sheridan, who served as colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry in 1862, was later promoted to the rank of major general during the war. The Greater Sheridan Road Association started to promote an extension of the road south to St. Louis and north through Wisconsin and Michigan to end at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor by 1922. The roadway followed US41's predecessor, M-15, and included numerous road signs bearing Sheridan's silhouette mounted on his horse Rienzi. Towns along the way were encouraged to rename city streets as Sheridan Road on Labor Day 1923. The road was promoted until the Great Depression in the 1930s. All that remains are signs in Menominee noting that First Street was once Sheridan Road.|$|E

5|$|The mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique}} among the {{historic}} residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal façade faces toward <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> western flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than toward the river. The original 1774 {{portion of the}} mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia {{at the time of}} Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England, and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861. The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E
