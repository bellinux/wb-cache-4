2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a commercial multiplex for Digital Television Terrestrial within Ireland was punctuated with many delays. The BAI (then the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland) engaged in two phases of <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> {{to assist in the}} development of its DTT Multiplex Licensing Policy. These consultations ran from May to December 2007 and involved the production of a comprehensive consultation document outlining policy proposals in relation to DTT licensing and the commissioning of independent research on DTT. It was initially proposed that RTÉ Television would operate the free-to-air public service multiplex, RTÉNL would provide the relevant broadcasting technologies and a third party would provide the pay or subscription service. These third parties included Easy TV, One vision DTT and Boxer. Initially, Boxer Ireland was given the licence to operate the pay DTT service. Boxer's failure to negotiate with RTÉNL and the economic downturn in Ireland resulted in Boxer no longer holding interest in pursuing its business in Ireland. On 20 April 2009, the BAI announced that Boxer had ended negotiations on the DTT contract without a successful outcome. Following this the consortium that made up One Vision were issued the licence. Once again, One Vision failed to negoiate with RTÉNL, hence negotiations were unsuccessful. On 29 April 2010 it was announced that Onevision had pulled out of negotiations. Finally, The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland began negotiating with Easy TV (a consortium made up of RTÉ and UPC Ireland).

40|$|Abstract — Rural electrification, {{regardless}} of whichever electrification scheme is utilized (grid extension, mini grids, or autonomous energy home systems) has many potential benefits. In particular, hybrid mini grid power systems are potentially highly valuable electrification scheme for remote rural electrification {{in comparison with}} other electrification schemes but they involve significant complexities in terms of design, implementation, and operation and maintenance. This implies {{that there are many}} challenges that have to be overcome before the benefits of hybrid systems can be achieved. A detail literature review and <b>targeted</b> <b>consultations</b> with a range of Fijian stakeholders were undertaken to better understand options for addressing some of the technical as well as the non-technical issues leading to the failure of hybrid mini grids in Fiji. Key findings suggest that lack of proper documentation on systems, carrying out system designs in isolation, failure to incorporate learnt from previous projects into newer projects and failure to understand the system and limitations; all are the contributing factors for an unsuccessful and unsustainable hybrid mini-grid in Fiji. Finally, this paper suggests some useful guidelines for successful and sustainable hybrid mini grid systems. Index Terms — mini grid, rural electrification, sustainable, I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reveals how}} the {{outcomes}} of large-scale land acquisitions made by foreign investors in Zambia {{are determined by the}} characteristics of the country's land governance system. Proposing a conceptual framework adapted from Williamson (1998), and using evidence constituted by expert interviews and focus group discussions, we scrutinize the nature and evolution of the Zambian land governance system, the steps that an investor has to go through in order to attain land and the actors shaping the acquisition process. Shedding light on the acquisition process for land, we find that enforcement of formal rules is currently weak. Depending on how the actors play the game, land acquisitions can feature aspects of both land grabs and of development opportunities. If customary land is <b>targeted,</b> <b>consultation,</b> displacements and compensations become especially problematic issues. Moreover, we find that the power balance between actors has been altered by the presence of these investors. In particular, local authorities have gained greater power and influence...|$|E
40|$|When {{national}} competitiveness is invoked as {{a policy}} objective, trade experts have learned to retort that countries don`t trade, firms do. This focus {{on the importance of}} the firm in international trade is consistent with the most recent developments in trade theory, but policy needs to catch up. Recognizing the growing anomalies in observed trade patterns relative to traditional models of trade based on national comparative advantage, the "new trade theory" of the 1980 s looked at industries not countries, leading Nobel prize-winner Paul Krugman, a pioneer in this literature, to suggest the need for a new trade policy. Recent work on what some call the "new-new trade theory" focuses on the trading behaviour of individual firms, making a tight link between trade and productivity. In this paper we demonstrate how focusing on firms should be the foundation for a new-new trade policy, one that creates exciting opportunities for trade and investment promotion strategies, along with the need for much more <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> strategies. We also discuss the implications of the new-new theory for regulatory coordination, and on new ways to cooperate with interlocutors in developing countries on the evolution of 21 st century trade policy.

A review of Creative New Zealand’s governing legislation was promised in the National Party’s arts culture and heritage policy in the 2008 election. The Ministry for Culture and Heritage, working with Creative New Zealand, Te Puni Kōkiri and the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, carried out the review, as well as <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> with the arts sector. The review recommends the creation of a single board responsible for policy, strategy and funding allocation, replacing the current more unwieldy division of responsibilities between four separate councils and committees including the Arts Council, the Arts Board, Te Waka Toi and the Pacific Arts Committee. The proposed streamlined board would have up to thirteen members, including a minimum of four members with knowledge of Māori arts and at least two with knowledge of Pacific arts. Under the existing structure there are 28 board and committee members. It is estimated that the governance reforms will also result in direct cost savings of approximately 200, 000 per annum and will free staff up to concentrate on core responsibilities to the arts sector, rather than servicing bureaucracy.

40|$|Hybrid mini-grids {{appear to}} be one of the most {{promising}} technological options for electrifying remote and rural areas. However, there are still important questions, technical and non-technical, regarding their capabilities and appropriate application. This thesis focuses on two key opportunities to improve hybrid system; advanced load modelling with the concept of load prioritization, and system design to permit relatively graceful degradation of hybrid mini-grid performance when some of the component technologies fail and cannot be immediately repaired. More broadly, the thesis has also sought to identify some wider challenges of successful project implementation in the particular context of Fiji. This thesis then presents a detailed study of load modelling carried out through consultation with authorities in Fiji and some small scale load surveys at the village level. It proposes establishing a hierarchy of load priority to ensure that the hybrid system continues to supply to most important loads should its capabilities decline due to failure or unexpected events. A widely used software design tool is then applied to design appropriate hybrid systems to meet such loads. However, standard performance metrics from this tool are extended through the use of failure mode analysis to better understand the potential resilience of different designs. A detailed literature review and <b>targeted</b> <b>consultations</b> with a range of Fijian stakeholders were undertaken to better understand options for addressing the non-technical challenges of project implementation. The research suggests some key findings: different hybrid systems can have different resilience to technical failures and other unexpected events and simple least cost performance optimisation may not always be appropriate; load prioritization can help secure delivery of the most essential energy services at times of partial system failure; and successful stakeholder engagement, system design, implementation, operation and maintenance all have a key role in achieving sustainable outcomes. In conclusion, this research argues for the use of multi-objective design criteria for the design of hybrid mini-grids. As such, the study recommends that research and development should become an integral part of the evolution of hybrid mini-grids in remote and rural applications...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} physical exercise interventions, done in the workplace, on sickness absence. The review was done with special interest in progress in the intervention effect and design the last 5 years. Method: The literature was identified by search in three scientific databases, PubMed, Sport Discus and Web of Science. The search identified 660 studies that were screened and then excluded if: 1. They were not in English. 2. Full text was not available. 3. The intervention was not implemented at the workplace or in relation with the workplace. 4. Sickness absence was not reported. 5. The study was not experimental design. 6. Intervention did not comprise physical exercise or aim to increase physical exercise. In total 10 studies {{were included in the}} review. Results: Two of the ten included studies showed significant decrease in sickness absence, revealing the effect of increased physical exercise on sickness absence. The positive effect in those two studies were shown with physical exercise during work hours and focused on high intensity exercise. In terms of intervention strategies, three studies <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> and lifestyle coaching to increase physical activity and the other seven studies had active physical exercise intervention. The intervention design varied between studies both of intensity and type of exercise. All of the studies had the aim to decrease sickness absence. Conclusion: Based on the results of this review, a fair conclusion seems that out of the amount of exercise interventions or interventions that promote physical activity to reduce sickness absence that has been conducted, only a small minority have shown evidence of effect. In this review studies comprising different kind of interventions were included in terms of intervention content, strategies as well as physical activity intensity...|$|E

The Strategy provides a framework within which jurisdictions can assess and improve existing activities. It also identifies new priority projects that could be progressed as national initiatives or by individual jurisdictions. The Strategy sets out eight underlying principles that will guide its implementation. These address {{issues such as the}} right for all Australians to have access to, and participate in, arts and cultural activities, and the need for people with a disability {{to be involved in the}} decisions that affect them. Ministers have agreed on four priority areas for action. These are: 	Addressing barriers to access and participation; 	Supporting artistic and cultural practice amongst those with a disability; 	Developing audiences for disability arts companies and individual artists; and 	Improving policy development and planning within governments. The Strategy is the result of extensive consultation, including 115 submissions made in response to a discussion paper released in late 2008, <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> with arts and disability peak bodies, and consultation with government agencies at all levels. Ministers have agreed to monitor progress on the Strategy every year. Information about activities that take place as part of the Strategy will be made available on the CMC website. Ministers will also review the Strategy after three years, in consultation with the arts and disability sector.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the appropriateness of the use of targeted antibiotics, and to analyze compliance and the short-term impact of <b>targeted</b> antibiotic advisory <b>consultations,</b> as implemented in our hospital in October 2002. Targeted antibiotics included glycopeptides, carbapenems, antipseudomonal cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides. A total of 339 prescriptions were reviewed from October 2002 through March 2003. Antimicrobial utilization density (AUD), which was the defined daily dose divided by 1000 patient days, was compared quarterly. Overall, 85. 6 % of the prescriptions were inappropriate, with 73. 7 % being inappropriate for therapeutic use and 100 % inappropriate for prophylactic use. The overall compliance rate of attending physicians with the antibiotic advisory consultations was 46. 5 %. Compliance was higher in medical services than in surgical services (64. 2 % vs 43. 1 %; P = 0. 005) and for therapeutic use than for prophylactic use (54. 7 % vs 36. 5 %; P = 0. 001). The use of all parenteral antibiotics in the hospital decreased, from 770. 8 AUD during the first quarter in 2002 to 626. 8 AUD during the second quarter in 2003 (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, inappropriate antibiotic use for treatment and prophylaxis is common in our hospital. A <b>targeted</b> antibiotic advisory <b>consultation</b> may be an alternative means of ensuring more appropriate antibiotic use.

40|$|Many Australians {{have limited}} access to health-care {{services}} due {{to a range of}} barriers, including geographic distance and restricted mobility, which telehealth can potentially address. This paper reviews the current and potential use of video consultation in primary health care in Australia, drawing on international literature. There is substantial evidence of high patient satisfaction, but many studies have methodological limitations. Overall, evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is weak. There is reasonable evidence for diagnosis, home care and specialist consultations by GPs with patients present. Two telehealth initiatives using video consultation are briefly presented. Both provide evidence that video consultation has a valuable role to play, but does not obviate the need for face-to-face consultations. Video consultation challenges traditional professional roles, particularly those of nurses, and can improve health workers’ skills and job satisfaction. More fundamentally, telehealth challenges the traditional distinction between primary and secondary care. This can be a source of resistance but may ultimately be one of its strengths. Appropriately <b>targeted</b> video <b>consultation</b> has much potential to improve the delivery of primary health care in Australia, particularly in rural and remote regions...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Vocational Pathways support young people, {{along with}} their families, teachers, and other {{influences}} to be more informed about their learning choices – to avoid “dead-ends”, and understand {{the consequences of their}} decisions in terms of their future possibilities. The VPs deliver three main benefits for learners: 	a sense of enhanced relevance, coherence and purpose for learning 	better preparation for further education and employment transitions 	exposure to a wider range of occupation and career possibilities. There are currently five Vocational Pathways covering: Primary Industries; Construction and Infrastructure; Manufacturing and Technology; Social and Community Services; Services Industries. A sixth pathway, for Creative Industries was launched on 30 June 2014. | The Ministry of Education has carried out a short <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> with key stakeholders on the implementation of the Vocational Pathways after one year of operation. The Vocational Pathways have become central to the Youth Guarantee initiatives: Fees-free programmes leading to National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) qualifications must align with the Vocational Pathways. Trades Academy programmes must deliver credits recommended in the Vocational Pathways. Regional Youth Guarantee networks are using the Vocational Pathways to support the development of programmes and education partnerships in the regions, to deliver coherent programmes and qualifications. The Ministry has also analysed NZQA results data from 2012 and 2013 (pre- and post- release of the draft pathways) to identify if there has been an impact on student decision-making, and the coherence of NCEA qualifications, {{as a result of the}} Vocational Pathways. Results are very encouraging.   In 2013, around twice as many students (35, 000) would have achieved a NCEA Level 2 qualification with at least one Vocational Pathway Award than in 2012 (16, 000).   The number has approximately doubled for each of the five pathways...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} amounts {{under management}} and their unregulated and opaque nature, hedge funds {{have emerged as}} a key concern for policymakers. While until now, hedge funds have been left essentially unregulated, we are seeing increasing calls for regulation for both microprudential and macroprudential reasons. In our view, most calls for the regulation of hedge funds {{are based on a}} misperception of the effectiveness of fi nancial regulations, perhaps coupled with a lack of understanding of the positive contribution of hedge funds to the fi nancial system. There are real concerns about consumer protection following from the expansion of the consumer base. However, it would be misguided to relax accreditation criteria. A more important issue is the investment of regulated institutions, in particular pension funds, in hedge funds. Since such institutions to enjoy direct or indirect government protection, the investment in hedge funds has to be regulated. However, such regulations are best implemented on the demand side by the pension fund regulator, rather than by directly regulating the hedge fund advisors themselves. Hedge funds provide considerable benefi ts, not only to their investors and advisors, but more importantly to the economy at large by facilitating price discovery, market effi ciency, diversifi cation, and by being potentially able to put a fl oor under a crisis, a function not easily implemented by regulated institutions due to a minimum capital ratios, relative performance evaluation and other considerations. It would however be imprudent to leave hedge fund advisors completely unregulated since the failure of a systematically important hedge fund has the potential to create such uncertainty as to impede trading and in a worst case scenario cause signifi cant damage to the real economy. These issues cannot be addressed by standard regulatory methodology such as disclosure and activity restrictions. Indeed, supervisors would be well advised to leave the hedge fund sector unregulated in their normal day-to-day activities. However, the regulator needs to have the power to resolve the informational uncertainty caused by the failure of a systematically important hedge funds. Prime brokers and other client banks would in such a scenario have a de facto or a de jure obligation to participate in the expedient removal of the uncertainty. To this end <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> and contingency planning is essential...|$|E

Collaboration is also highlighted as a key element in the SUTP, SUMP and SULP methodology fundamental to improvement of the planning procedures [74]. Key stakeholders involved in the identified planning process are: logistics service providers, suppliers, receivers, parish councils, road haulage operators and delivery companies, and heavy goods vehicle drivers [2]. In Västra Götaland, for example, a freight strategy reference group with representatives from municipalities, municipal associations, businesses, academia, research institutes, NGOs and government agencies is involved in the planning [31]. Freight plans are designed to best serve the needs of both the freight industry and local communities by consulting with local authorities, representatives of the freight and logistics community. The use of a collaborative approach is in line with Lindholm’s [20] conclusion that including all relevant stakeholders in the planning process secures acceptance, thus increasing the likelihood of the plan delivering its full potential benefit [39].|$|R

Commissioner Moedas affirmed in his Mission Statement that: “Improving research infrastructure and making better use of research results is essential to strengthen innovation further, develop new activities and boost the productivity and competitiveness of our economy”. The Informal Competitiveness Council of July 2014 highlighted the importance of long-term sustainability of RI, stressing that open access to RI and data, better links with industry and prioritisation based on a multi-level approach (national, European and international level) were key to ensure sustainability. Furthermore, RI need a long-term perspective for their construction and operation. Building on the achievements of the European Research Area and the Innovation Union flagship initiative, there is now a need to identify the next steps for a more comprehensive approach and vision on the long-term sustainability of RI, fully using their potential to deliver on the Commission priorities on open innovation, open science and open to the world. Given these premises, from 2 nd December 2015 to 1 st February 2016, the Commission opened an online Consultation on Long-term sustainability of Research Infrastructures with RI stakeholders, receiving 200 answers. The aim of this <b>targeted</b> <b>consultation</b> was to collect key stakeholders’ views on the interrelated pre-conditions that could ensure the long-term sustainability of RI and the potential actions/measures to tackle the challenges posed by their implementation. The pre-identified pre-conditions are Ensuring Scientific excellence, Skills of managers, operators and users, Unlocking Innovation potential of RI, Measuring socio-economic impact of RI, Exploiting better the data generated by the RI, RI Life cycle – Upgrading of RI, RI Life cycle – Decommissioning of RI, Ensuring sustainable governance of RI, Funding the construction and operation of RI and Structuring the international dimension of RI. For every pre-condition, the consultation provided a short explanation and {{a brief description of the}} issues at stake and possible actions. The communities targeted by the consultation were ERA stakeholders, ESFRI projects and ERICs, ESFRI delegations/ PC members, e-IRG, EIROforum, International Organizations, RI associations (e. g. ERF), NCPs (dissemination within key stakeholders), and Science attaches from strategic third country partners. Data were collected with an online semi-standardized questionnaire, i. e. with a mix of close-ended and open-ended questions. The qualitative open-ended questions addressed the most relevant topics in the survey, i. e. the measures to tackle the challenges posed by the pre-conditions for sustainability; this type of questions allowed interviewees to freely express their considerations in their own words allowing therefore for the possibility to deepen their answers with personal opinions and experiences. The response rate to the consultation was very high as was also the level of detail provided by the respondents in the open questions. This has positively impacted both on the quality and on the reliability of the consultation results. The responses have been subsequently analysed with the support of an external. An overview of the initial findings of the consultation was already presented on the occasion of the ESFRI Roadmap 2016 Update Launch event that took place on 10 March 2016 in Amsterdam. The final purpose of this consultation was to derive the main trends on RI sustainability, as perceived by the targeted communities, on which basis elements of an action plan can be developed in concertation with the main stakeholders. Therefore, this report presents such trends extracted from the responses received by the Commission services during the consultation. The report provides an overview of the methodology used for consultation, the profile of the respondents and a summary of the survey results...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This paper {{reports on}} a study {{undertaken}} for the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), which explored the economic implications of alternative scholarly publishing models. Rather than simply summarising the study’s findings, this paper focuses on the approach and presents a step-by-step account of the research process, highlighting the combination of process mapping, activity costing and macro modelling. Method. The analysis relies primarily on existing sources, collating activity cost information from the wide-ranging literature on scholarly communication. Where necessary, these sources were supplemented by <b>targeted</b> informal <b>consultation</b> with experts. Analysis. We examine the costs and potential benefits of the major alternative models for scholarly publishing, including subscription publishing, open access publishing and self-archiving. Adopting a formal approach to modelling the scholarly communication process and identifying activity costs, this paper presents activity and system-wide costs {{for each of the}} alternative publishing models. It then explores the potential impacts of enhanced access on returns to R&D. Results. We find that different scholarly publishing models could make a material difference to the costs faced by various parties and to the returns on investment in R&D that might be realised. Conclusion. It seems likely that more open access could have substantial benefits in the longer term. While the benefits may be lower during a transitional period they would be likely to be positive for both open access publishing and self-archiving alternatives...|$|R

Allied healthcare professionals {{are one of the}} <b>targets</b> for <b>consultation</b> of recommendation of CAM by patients. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the CAM usage and recommendation pattern of allied healthcare professionals so that professionals training institutions could decide the suitability for involvement of CAM knowledge into courses. This study evaluated a series of factors which might contribute to differences in CAM usage and recommendation by allied healthcare professionals. One hundred and sixteen and 219 healthcare professionals from Hong Kong and the United States were surveyed on demographic data, personal usage and professional recommendation of CAM. Results revealed that 39 % of healthcare professionals in Hong Kong and 91 % in the US used CAM. 19 % of professionals in Hong Kong and 70 % in the US have recommended CAM to patients. In both places, around three fourth of the participants (HK: 82. 3 %, US: 71. 2 %) reported that with inadequate knowledge of CAM. The results highlighted the necessity for further education and training of allied healthcare professionals with regards to CAM use. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary The Australian Fair Pay Commission {{undertakes}} ongoing {{research and}} consultation programs {{to ensure its}} wage-setting decisions take into account economic and social circumstances of low-paid Australians and their employers. The information, gathered through stakeholder consultations, submissions and economic research, has been supplemented by a program of <b>targeted</b> public <b>consultations.</b> TNS Social Research was commissioned to conduct and report on the public consultations. Cultural Partners Australia were commissioned to undertake consultations with the Indigenous community. This report presents the consolidated findings from three stages of public consultations, which included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and online discussion forums with employers, employees and job seekers. Stage one of the consultation program was conducted over November and December 2008, stage two was conducted in February and March 2009 and stage three in April 2009. The findings from stage one provided a benchmark from which to track changes in views and experiences over time. Stages two and three engaged all of the Commission’s target groups and, where appropriate, reconvened with participants involved in previous stages. As economic and labour market conditions have evolved over the consultation period, the findings in this report examine the changes in attitudes and behaviours observed. Where appropriate, comparisons are also made with findings from public consultations conducted for the 2007 and 2008 Minimum Wage Reviews, and research conducted over May/June 2008 that explored employer responses to minimum wage adjustments...|$|R

By piecing out different uses of the repository, an IR manager can create a “toolbox” of services that can be used individually or combined in different ways for more <b>targeted</b> marketing, <b>consultations,</b> outreach, training, and education. Having an IR toolbox allows repository services to be easily integrated with other researcher services on campus and facilitates more meaningful interactions with researchers, liaison librarians, and other stakeholders. In this presentation, I discuss how we have developed a toolbox for ScholarlyCommons, the University of Pennsylvania’s institutional repository, and some {{of the ways in which}} we are utilizing that toolbox within the Penn community. Presenting and promoting our institutional repository in this way has allowed for better education and training for liaison librarians, resulting in a greater number of projects coming into the repository through liaison relations, and has additionally enabled more constructive consultations, resulting in better metadata and quality assurance during new series setup and population. As Penn continues to develop its suite of researcher services, we are working to integrate repository services into various internal and external systems, which, in turn, increases the number of “tools” in our IR toolbox. This integration with other researcher services enables wider dissemination of ScholarlyCommons as a resource for the Penn community and promotes its use throughout the research process...|$|R
