5|$|On 1 July 1997, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Hong Kong {{from the}} United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China took place, officially marking {{the end of}} Hong Kong's 156 years under British colonial governance. As the largest {{remaining}} colony of the United Kingdom, the loss of Hong Kong effectively represented {{the end of the}} British Empire. This <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> made Hong Kong the first special administrative region of China. Tung Chee-Hwa, a pro-Beijing business tycoon, was elected Hong Kong's first Chief Executive by a selected electorate of 800 in a televised programme.|$|E

This new flag gained formal legal status {{replacing}} the blue ensign at the handover on 1 July 1997.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the 20th century and {{the early years of the}} 21st, more such choral symphonies were written. Krzysztof Penderecki's Seventh Symphony was for the third {{millennium}} of the city of Jerusalem. Tan Dun's Symphony 1997: Heaven Earth Mankind commemorated the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Hong Kong that year to the People's Republic of China.

5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First Opium War (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
25|$|After their {{respective}} <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> Hong Kong and Macau continue to practice English Common Law and Portuguese legal systems respectively, {{with their own}} courts of final appeal. In other words, Hong Kong and Macau lie outside of the legal jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, except on constitutional issues.|$|R

5|$|The Flag of Hong Kong between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of Hong Kong on a white disk. In Hong Kong, it is also nicknamed the Hong Kong flag (Chinese: 香港旗) or the Dragon and Lion flag (Chinese: 龍獅旗). In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British Hong Kong. While the flag lost its official status following 1 July 1997 <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Hong Kong, it resurfaced in the 2010s as a symbol of protest against Chinese intervention in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment flowing into the mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E

25|$|The waging of {{aggressive}} war by Japan against China in 1937 and beyond violates the peace that was brokered in the Treaty of Shimonoseki.

Therefore, some argue that, with no valid <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> taking place, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belongs to China.|$|E

This is because mana {{is not the same thing}} as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E
