Since there are three roles in the BOS UI, the tasks were {{organized}} according to the responsibilities of the different roles. The participants were given different roles to complete corresponding tasks on BOS UI. In total, there were 22 <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> the BOS UI which are listed in Appendix “Tasks for the BOS UI in the experiment”. The ESHL GUI, on the other hand, does not support multiple roles, therefore only 8 <b>tasks</b> were designed <b>for</b> this user interface. These tasks can be found in Appendix “Tasks for the ESHL GUI in the experiment”. In order to prevent test users from having a preconceived prejudice against any of the both user interfaces, the evaluation website was programmed to display the <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> the two user interfaces in different orders. More specifically, half of the test users started with the <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> the BOS UI and another half started with the <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> the ESHL GUI, so as to balance potential bias.|$|R

IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard <b>task</b> <b>for</b> supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E

It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the <b>task</b> <b>for</b> Allied double agents was to convince them that the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception.

5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this <b>task</b> <b>for</b> the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible <b>task</b> <b>for</b> Tubman.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{selection}} of a volatile hassium compound (hassium tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning, the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult <b>task</b> <b>for</b> a long time. Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this hassium isotope, 269Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but also the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1 pb), and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation. The direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,xn)274−xHs (x = 4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7 pb. This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.|$|E

40|$|Rodent {{behavioural}} {{tasks are}} indispensable {{to advance the}} understanding of gene x environment interactions in neuropsychiatric disorders and the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Yet, the actual translation of rodent data to humans, and thereby {{the understanding of the}} pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is limited. The main reason for the translational flaw is that many behavioural <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> rodents are based on face or predictive validity, whereas these types of validity often lack a pathophysiological basis. Furthermore, many behavioural <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> rodents do not implement human task parameters or use task parameters in a controlled manner, whereas they are parameters that provide the environmental challenges to test gene function. The aim of this perspective is to address the status quo of behavioural <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> rodents, their limitations and their strengths, and the reasons why they could lead to suboptimal translational research. I also suggest an approach to come closer to neuropsychiatric behavioural <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> rodents, namely a more careful implementation of human task parameters and subdivision of behaviour into perceptional, motivational, activational and switching domains. Finally, I will touch upon behavioural <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> rodents that are currently lacking and needed to catch up neuropsychiatric research...|$|R

5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important <b>task</b> <b>for</b> ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E
5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical <b>task</b> <b>for</b> the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States.|$|E
