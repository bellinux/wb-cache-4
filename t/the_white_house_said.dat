The device failed to go off correctly, and the suspect suffered burns to his lower body. Three other passengers had minor injuries. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> it considered the incident an attempted terrorist attack.|$|E
500|$|Rangel again {{expressed}} his displeasure {{with the vice}} president in October 2006 – after Cheney had said that [...] "Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works" [...] – by opining that Cheney is [...] "a real son of a bitch" [...] who [...] "enjoys a confrontation", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. [...] <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a [...] "big hearty laugh" [...] over them.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 1993, the White House {{issued its}} own 80-page {{report on the}} firings, one that the New York Times termed [...] "strikingly self-critical". [...] Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, {{included}} McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends of the Clintons {{to become involved in}} a matter with which they had a business stake. [...] It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave. [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who called for an independent investigation. [...] As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process — and said they would be given other jobs (which five of them were; Dale and his assistant director retired.) [...] The White House report also contained the initial indications of the First Lady's involvement in the firings, saying that she had taken an interest in the Travel Office's alleged mismanagement and had been informed two days in advance that the firings would take place. [...] There was no indication of involvement from President Clinton himself, although he had earlier taken broad public responsibility for what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, Vitter {{announced}} that he got [...] "a critical concession" [...] from the White House that decreased Louisiana's obligations for hurricane recovery by $1 billion. However, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that was false.|$|E
2500|$|... "Jay Rosen, {{a journalism}} {{professor}} at New York University and specialist in blogging, said Mr. Graff's odyssey was significant ... he {{showed that it}} was harder to get a pass than <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> {{it was after the}} Guckert case." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, President Bush signed [...] {{restoring}} the Libyan government's immunity from terror-related lawsuits and dismissing {{all of the}} pending compensation cases in the US, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said.</b> US State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, called the move a [...] "laudable milestone ... {{clearing the way for}} a continued and expanding US-Libyan partnership." ...|$|E
50|$|Within the United States, {{there is}} widespread, {{bipartisan}} {{support for the}} role of private water in improving infrastructure and delivering safe drinking water. The U.S. Conference of Mayors Urban Water Council, the National League of Cities, the Brookings Institution, and <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> have <b>said</b> that private water companies provide proven and important options for municipalities facing urgent water infrastructure and operational needs.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1993, the Enron Corporation hired Baker as a {{consultant}} within a month of his departure from <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> and Enron <b>said</b> that Baker would {{have an opportunity to}} invest in any projects he developed.|$|R
25|$|On Friday, July 13, 1973, {{during a}} {{preliminary}} interview, deputy minority counsel Donald Sanders asked <b>White</b> <b>House</b> assistant Alexander Butterfield {{if there was}} any type of recording system in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Butterfield <b>said</b> he was reluctant to answer, but finally stated there was a new system in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> that automatically recorded everything in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and others, as well as Nixon’s private office in the Old Executive Office Building.|$|R
2500|$|Some authors {{say that}} Marcos {{prevented}} civil war {{similar to the}} Syrian Civil War by refusing to use guns notwithstanding the insistence of his top general, and by agreeing to step down during the EDSA revolution. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> [...] "By leaving the Philippines at a critical juncture in his nation's history, Mr. Marcos permitted the peaceful transition to popular, democratic rule." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – [...] <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that US President George W. Bush pledged {{his support}} to the British {{government}} over the crisis and agreed to help {{them in any way}} that he could. Furthermore, on 1 April President Bush at a press conference at Camp David said that [...] "The British hostages issue is a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out of Iraqi water".|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} for <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> on April 24 that [...] "the White House {{is taking}} the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments.

He also noted, [...] "This is obviously a cause for concern... {{but it is not}} a cause for alarm".|$|E
25|$|Israel, the U.S., the European Commission {{and several}} European {{countries}} reacted with shock and indignation. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev {{said that the}} Iranian regime holds a “perverse vision of the world”. Germany’s foreign minister called Ahmadinejad’s remarks “shocking and unacceptable”. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> spokesman <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> comments underline the need to “keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons”. A European Commission spokeswoman called the comments “completely unacceptable”.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} several stories about the ghosts of former Presidents revisiting <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> with perhaps <b>the</b> most common and popular one being that of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln's Ghost, {{otherwise}} known as <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Ghost, is <b>said</b> to have haunted <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> since his death in 1865.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{figures were}} very {{different}} from preliminary estimates in September 2003 {{by the head of}} the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Colombia, which indicated that output in Peru and Bolivia may have risen by as much 21%, or 150 km² that year. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> office <b>said</b> its estimate was based on sampling from high resolution satellite imagery. The United Nations used a different technique and had not yet put out any formal estimate for 2003.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Solis {{should not}} be penalized for any {{mistakes}} that her husband may have made. [...] The revelations came {{in the wake of}} several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues. [...] Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not hold Solis to blame for the taxes situation, but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work. [...] On February 11, 2009, the committee finally supported her nomination by voice vote with two dissensions.|$|E
2500|$|Committee Republican Mike Enzi also {{pressed her}} on whether her unpaid but {{high-level}} positions at American Rights at Work constituted a prohibited lobbying activity; {{she said she}} had done no lobbying and was in violation of no rules of conduct. [...] Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> was an unintentional oversight. [...] After more time passed with no motion on her nomination, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|The Christian right {{characterized}} {{his testimony}} as supporting a [...] "loosening [...] regulations". However, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that Holsinger's concerns only involved {{the severity of}} the penalties. In 2005, he argued against a Kentucky anti-cloning bill, warning it could restrict future research. Holsinger testified that his father died of Parkinson's disease which is under investigation for gene therapy. During the HELP hearing, Holsinger said he supported President Bush's stem cell policy, which restricts federal funding to already existing embryonic cell lines while providing funds for adult and animal stem cell research.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Straley, a {{spokesman}} for <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Boys, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> school segregated <b>white</b> and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held. He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn't been discovered. [...] "I {{think that there are}} at least 100 more bodies up there", he said. [...] "At some point they are going to find more bodies, I'm dead certain of that. There has to be a <b>white</b> graveyard on <b>the</b> <b>white</b> side." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bush overflew {{the devastated}} area from Air Force One as he {{traveled}} from Texas back to Washington, D.C., and subsequently visited the Gulf Coast on Friday and was briefed on Hurricane Katrina. Turning to his aides during the flyover, Bush remarked, [...] "It's totally wiped out. It's devastating, it's {{got to be}} doubly devastating on the ground." [...] Later, in a televised address from <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> he <b>said,</b> [...] "We're dealing {{with one of the}} worst national disasters in our nation's history." ...|$|R
5000|$|Raffert was 60 when {{he became}} Executive Chef, and retired in October 1992 just before he turned 65. A confessed [...] "nibbler" [...] as he cooked, Raffert lost 20 lb after retiring. Frank Ruta, a Washington, D.C.-based chef who trained under Raffert at <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> later <b>said</b> [...] "Hans was a guy that could do it all. He could do it all, and {{he could do it}} all quickly, efficiently, neatly. He was just a walking {{encyclopedia}} of classical cooking." ...|$|R
2500|$|That same day, a We the People {{petition}} {{was launched}} via the whitehouse.gov website seeking [...] "a full, free and absolute pardon for any crimes [...] has committed or may have committed related to blowing {{the whistle on}} secret NSA surveillance programs." [...] The petition attained 100,000 signatures within two weeks, thus meeting the threshold and requiring an official response from the White House. The White House answered on July 28, 2015, declining to pardon Snowden. In a response written by Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and terrorism advisor, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Snowden's disclosures had severe consequences for national security {{and that he should}} come home to be judged by a jury of his peers.|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2016, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that President Obama {{had ordered}} the {{intelligence}} agencies to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign; Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review to be led by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper {{was meant to be}} [...] "an effort to challenge the outcome of the election". Simultaneously, the U.S. press published reports, with reference to senior administration officials, that U.S. intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, had concluded with [...] "high confidence" [...] that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton's chances and promote Donald Trump. President-elect Donald Trump rejected the CIA assessment that Russia was behind the hackers' efforts to sway the campaign in his favour as [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
2500|$|Bannon {{was removed}} from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a {{reorganization}} by U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, who Bannon had helped select. Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose of serving on the committee was as a check against former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about {{a conversation with the}} Russian ambassador to the United States. Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed. Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if president Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was [...] "total nonsense". Bannon had only attended one NSC meeting.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, {{there was}} a flurry of {{speculation}} that Clinton would be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by Justice John Paul Stevens' retirement, including a plug from ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch. The notion was quickly quashed by <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> which <b>said,</b> [...] "The president thinks Secretary Clinton is doing an excellent job {{as secretary of state}} and wants her to remain in that position." [...] A State Department spokesperson said that Clinton [...] "loves her present job and is not looking for another one." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 12, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{responded to}} <b>the</b> allegations. Laura Lucas Magnuson, {{spokeswoman}} for the National Security Council, said, [...] "Displaying the rug for only half a day {{in connection with a}} private book launch event, as proposed, would have been an inappropriate use of U.S. government property, would have required <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> to undertake <b>the</b> risk of transporting the rug for limited public exposure, and was not viewed as commensurate with the rug's historical significance". <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> decision to keep the rug in storage [...] "does not preclude" [...] the possibility that it might be displayed sometime in the future.|$|R
2500|$|Gregg has a {{track record}} of {{opposing}} funding for the Census, that is highlighted by his tenure as the Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Budget. The Congressional Black Caucus and National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials both expressed disappointment at Gregg's nomination because the United States Department of Commerce oversees <b>the</b> Census. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> subsequently <b>said</b> it take control of the 2010 United States Census, but then backpedaled saying that they would [...] "work closely" [...] with the United States Census Director. Republicans were alarmed by the foreshadowing of [...] "backroom deals" [...] by <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and Rahm Emanuel.|$|R
2500|$|United States President Barack Obama {{shook hands}} with Cuban leader Raul Castro, the first such {{encounter}} between sitting U.S. and Cuban heads of government since Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro shook hands at the U.N. in 2000. The gesture prompted criticism from Republican politicians in Washington. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American opponent of the Castro government, said: [...] "Sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when {{the leader of the}} free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant." [...] Senator John McCain compared the Obama–Castro handshake to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's handshake with Adolf Hitler when the two were in the process of negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 saying, [...] "Neville Chamberlain {{shook hands with}} Hitler. It gives Raul some propaganda to continue to prop up his dictatorial, brutal regime, that's all". The Cuban government welcomed the gesture, although <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> it had been unplanned.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W. Bush {{used the}} phrase war on terrorism in an ostensibly unscripted comment when answering a journalist′s question {{about the impact of}} enhanced law enforcement authority given to the U.S. surveillance agencies on Americans′ civil liberties: [...] "This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. [...] And we understand. [...] And the American people are beginning to understand. [...] This crusade, this war on terrorism {{is going to take a}} while. [...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. [...] It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anderson Cooper on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Congressman Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it [...] "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This {{is the kind of}} over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." [...] Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to [...] "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. In response to the news report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President, a Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, dismissed the account as [...] "comical". <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>said</b> that the press report figures were [...] "wildly inflated" [...] and had [...] "no basis in reality". While stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons, staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents Bush and Clinton.|$|E
