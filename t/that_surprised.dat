5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E
5|$|The siege at the Peñol de Cerquín {{dragged on}} for months, with {{constant}} fighting. The Spanish there numbered about a hundred, plus auxiliaries, but were unable to maintain supply lines through the surrounding hostile territory, and were often short of food. The seasonal rains that arrived in spring 1538 only added to their hardship. The supplies from El Salvador finally arrived, and Cáceres slowly gained territory around the Peñol. After six months, Cáceres invited Lempira to a parley. Lempira arrived, dressed in full regalia, cotton armour, and plumed headdress, accompanied by a retinue of nobles. Cáceres sent a mounted soldier to request his surrender, and when Lempira refused, a carefully hidden arquebusier shot him through the head. This was a signal for an all-out surprise attack by the Spanish. The Indians responded with complete panic at {{the death of their}} leader, and the Spanish onslaught swiftly took the fortress without any Spanish loss of life, although some were wounded. A portion of the indigenous garrison retreated to nearby mountains, but most of the Indians surrendered without further resistance, including a great many women, children and elderly. Cáceres followed Montejo's instructions in dealing with the defeated natives with moderation. He followed native custom and sent gifts of textiles and fowls to the native leaders, as a symbol of peace, accompanied by a spear as a promise of war should they refuse to submit. After a council, the Indian leaders accepted peace, and the region passed immediately under Spanish control. Cáceres released all his prisoners to return to their villages, a move <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> the natives, who had expected harsh punitive measures. The fall of Lempira's stronghold was followed by the speedy capitulation of a wide area of Honduras, and came at a critical juncture for the Spanish, when they had been at the point of losing the province.|$|E

40|$|Surprise {{is often}} thought of as an {{experience}} that is elicited following an unexpected event. However, {{it may also be}} the case <b>that</b> <b>surprise</b> stems from an event that is simply difficult to explain. In this paper, we investigate the latter view. Specifically, we question why the provision of an enabling factor can mitigate perceived surprise for an unexpected event despite lowering the overall probability of that event. One possibility is <b>that</b> <b>surprise</b> occurs when a person cannot rationalise an outcome event {{in the context of the}} scenario representation. A second possibility is that people can generate plausible explanations for unexpected events but <b>that</b> <b>surprise</b> is experienced when those explanations are uncertain. We explored these hypotheses in an experiment where a first group of participants rated surprise for a number of scenario outcomes and a second group rated surprise after generating a plausible explanation for those outcomes. Finally, a third group of participants rated surprise for the both the original outcomes and the reasons generated for those outcomes by the second group. Our results suggest that people can come up with plausible explanations for unexpected events but <b>that</b> <b>surprise</b> results when these explanations are uncertain...|$|R

Colby participated in the National Security Council meetings that responded to apparent Soviet intentions {{to intervene in the}} war by raising the alert level of U.S. forces to DEFCON 3 and defusing the crisis. In 1975, after many years of involvement, South Vietnam fell to Communist forces in April 1975, a particularly difficult blow for Colby, who had dedicated so much of his life and career to the American effort there. Events in the arms-control field, Angola, Australia, the Middle East, and elsewhere also demanded attention.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, the contingents {{increased to}} 76, {{including those of}} the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups. The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s. Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade. The 1968 edition, although held on a rainy morning <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> even the marching contingents and the dignitaries, saw the first ground performances on the Padang as the weather improved - a prelude to today's show performances. 1969's parade, the one where the Mobile Column made its first drivepast, commemorated the 150th year of the city's founding and had Princess Alexandra of the UK as principal guest.|$|E
25|$|The Concrete Herald {{was founded}} in Hamilton, Washington in 1901, then moved to Concrete, Washington in 1913. After {{changing}} its owners and editors several times, the newspaper entered a 40-year period of stability when from 1929 to 1970 it was owned and edited by Charles Dwelley. During this period, as Dwelley's editorials were picked up by other publications and quoted nationwide, the Herald recognition and subscription base expanded beyond Concrete, into Skagit Valley. After Dwelley's retirement, The Concrete Herald was purchased by Robert and June Fader, both experienced journalists. However, after Robert's premature death in 1985, and June's retirement in late 1989, the Herald was purchased by a local businessman unconnected to publishing business {{which led to the}} newspaper's demise in 1991.

25|$|Simultaneously, from 12 to 14 December, Georgian forces {{under general}} Tsitsianov {{were struck by}} Armenian troops around the villages of Vorontsovka and Privolnoye. On 12 December, the National Guard {{detachment}} that was guarding Vorontsovka was called back to Tbilisi {{to participate in a}} military parade marking the 1st anniversary of the National Guard of Georgia. Tsitsianov's few hundred men, although heavily outnumbered, offered brutal resistance with their artillery, using shrapnel ammunition at point-blank range. The Armenians eventually managed to take both towns. The Georgian forces, having suffered more than 100 killed and some material losses at that point, retreated towards Katharinenfeld. On December 14, The Armenians, who had already amassed more than 6,500 regular troops supported by thousands of armed local militia, steam-rolled what resistance remained in the Alexandrovka-Vorontsovka-Privolnoye triangle. By {{the end of the second}} day of that attack, the Armenian army had captured almost all of the contested villages. Sanahin and Alaverdi also fell. The Georgian defenders and refugees started to evacuate the area by train on December 17. The Georgians sustained heavy losses, leaving behind hundreds of prisoners, one train and both derailed armoured trains. The Armenian army's left flank, commanded by colonel Nikogosov and colonel Korolkov, performed decisive flanking manoeuvers <b>that</b> <b>surprised</b> and encircled the Georgians in Ayrum and culminated in the capture of the town on December 18. Despite a successful breakout, the Georgian 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments lost around 560 men killed, wounded or taken prisoner, and about 25 machine guns and two canons in total.|$|E
