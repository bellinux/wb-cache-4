Under the influence of Ambrose, Gratian prohibited pagan worship at Rome, refused to wear the insignia of the pontifex maximus as unbefitting a Christian, removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate at Rome and confiscated its revenues, despite protests from the pagan members of the Senate.

25|$|Following the {{creation}} of a Romanian Principality, Ursari nonetheless remained a presence associated with busking and fairs, especially with those held in Bucharest and provincial cities such as Bacău. As early as the rule of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, they formed a staple of such spectacles, alongside the music-playing Lăutari, the Căluşari, and freak shows. At around the same time, they included a section of zavragii, smiths who worked as day laborers. Also during the late 19th century, the Ursari came to be attested in Imperial Russian-ruled Bessarabia, where the local population referred <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the lăieşi in general as şătraşi ("people living on campsites").|$|E
25|$|Dressed up as a stereotypical nerd in his basement, the Nerd {{reviews the}} game with his {{trademark}} eyeglasses and white collared shirt with a pocket full of pens, high khaki pants and white socks and loafers, while sometimes being bombarded by guest characters from video games and popular culture as well. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games, mock the Nerd's anguish, and act as parodies of the characters from {{which they had been}} derived. In response <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the games, the Nerd derives comic appeal from excessive and surrealistic use of fantasy scenarios, anger, and consumption of Rolling Rock (in addition to Yuengling in later videos) while reviewing video games. His anger and profanity over these bad games would sometimes climax in him destroying whole game cartridges, simulating defacation on, burning, and sometimes even crushing entire video game consoles.|$|E

The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a {{sustained}} and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger – 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of all of those who have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this has brought <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their families.|$|E
25|$|In 1703 Güshi Khan's ruling {{grandson}} Tenzin Wangchuk Khan {{was murdered}} by his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso for his deceptions {{and in the same}} year, {{with the support of the}} Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's intereference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet. The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an imposter set up by the regent. Lhazang Khan, now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near Lake Qinghai, ostensibly from illness.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over <b>to</b> <b>them</b> (<b>and</b> <b>to</b> certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E

Benfica made club history in the match; at half-time they were already losing 4–0, and three more goals in the second half broke the record for goals conceded, in their worst defeat ever. At their next training session hundreds of fans booed the team, and the club president compelled his players to apologize for their performance. Team captain João Pinto read a statement: [...] "To Benfica, and to their supporters; aware of the abnormality of the result from the match in Vigo; the players, represented by the captain and vice-captain, publicly acknowledge that they didn't perform to club standards.
