40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} of temocapril, a prodrug of <b>temocaprilat,</b> was evaluated in an in situ rat jejunal perfusion model {{under various conditions}} of luminal pH and in the presence and absence of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis. Temocapril was more eas-ily taken up by mucosal cells at a luminal pH of 5. 4 than at pH 6. 4 or 7. 4 and was extensively hydrolyzed to <b>temocaprilat</b> in mucosal cells. The hydrolysis was limited by the intrinsic clearance and the influx rate at luminal perfusate pHs of 5. 4 and 7. 4, respectively. <b>Temocaprilat,</b> derived from temocapril, was transported into both mesenteric vein and jejunal lumen according to pH partition the-ory. The net {{absorption of}} both temocapril and <b>temocaprilat</b> was highest at a luminal perfusate pH of 5. 4. When both the luminal and venous fluid were at pH 7. 4, <b>temocaprilat</b> was transported approx-imately 3 -fold faster into the lumen than into the vein, due presum-ably to the greater surface area of the brush border membrane {{because of the presence}} of microvilli. Under carboxylesterase-inhibited conditions, the hydrolysis of temocapril was inhibited by only 50 %. It is postulated that serine esterases located on the membranes of the epithelial cells were responsible for the residual hydrolysis. We have confirmed that temocapril is most easily ab-sorbed in the proximal intestine after meals, due to prolongation of the gastric emptying time, the lower intraluminal pH caused by secretion of bile acid, and the interaction between serine esterases and the digesta...|$|E

40|$|Temocapril is a prodrug whose {{hydrolysis}} by carboxylesterase 1 (CES 1) {{yields the}} active ACE inhibitor <b>temocaprilat.</b> This molecular-dynamics (MD) study uses a resolved {{structure of the}} human CES 1 (hCES 1) to investigate some mechanistic details of temocapril hydrolysis. The ionization constants of temocapril (pK 1 and pK 3) and <b>temocaprilat</b> (pK 1, pK 2, and pK 3) were determined experimentally and computationally using commercial algorithms. The constants so obtained were in good agreement and revealed that temocapril exists mainly in three ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, and an anion), whereas <b>temocaprilat</b> exists in four major ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, an anion, and a dianion). All these ionic forms were used as ligands in 5 -ns MS simulations. While the cationic and zwitterionic forms of temocapril were involved in an ion-pair bond with Glu 255 suggestive of an inhibitor behavior, the anionic form remained in a productive interaction with the catalytic center. As for <b>temocaprilat,</b> its cation appeared trapped by Glu 255, while its zwitterion and anion made a slow departure from the catalytic site and a partial egress from the protein. Only its dianion was effectively removed from the catalytic site and attracted to the protein surface by Lys residues. A detailed mechanism of product egress emerges from the simulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} for hepatic uptake of <b>temocaprilat,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is predominantly excreted into bile was studied using isolated rat hepatocytes and COS- 7 cells expressing the organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp 1). The uptake of <b>temocaprilat</b> into isolated rat hepatocytes exhibited saturation with a Km of 20. 9 microM and a Vmax of 0. 21 nmol/min/mg protein. This uptake was temperature sensitive and was significantly reduced by metabolic inhibitors, a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent and an anion-exchange inhibitor, although {{the replacement of}} Na+ with Li+ in the medium {{did not affect the}} uptake. [3 H]Temocaprilat uptake was inhibited by estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide and dibromosulphophthalein, typical substrates for the Na+-independent organic anion transporter, in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas excess estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide did not completely inhibit the uptake. <b>Temocaprilat</b> uptake into COS- 7 cells transfected with oatp 1 cDNA revealed a concentration-dependency with a Km of 46. 7 microM, a value comparable with that obtained in isolated hepatocytes. The contribution of oatp 1 to carrier-mediated hepatic uptake of <b>temocaprilat</b> was less than 50 % by correcting the uptake clearance with that of estradiol- 17 beta-D-glucuronide. A good linear correlation was observed for the inhibitory effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (benazeprilat, cilazaprilat, delaprilat and enalaprilat) between isolated hepatocytes and oatp 1 -expressing cells.

40|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) plays an {{important}} role in regulating blood pressure. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) inhibit the RAS and have been shown to be effective treatments for hypertension 1. Independent of their ability to lower blood pressure, these compounds had also been reported to protect the organs, such as kidney and heart. So far, the mechanism of those protective effects have not been extensively studied, however, some protection may be due to their effects on the results of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to characterize the antioxidant activity of olmesartan and <b>temocaprilat</b> in blood vessel of hemodialysis patients. First, oxidized albumin ratios as an oxidative stress marker were determined by HPLC to evaluate the antioxidant activities of olmesartan and <b>temocaprilat</b> in plasma of hemodialysis patients. In addition, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we examined the effect of olmesartan and <b>temocaprilat</b> on the oxidative stresses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), oxidized-human serum albumin (oxi-HSA), which are known to promote the ROS production in hemodialysis patients. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed to analyze the oxidative states of serum albumin as described previously 2.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{examined}} {{whether the}} combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) synergistically mediates coronary vasodilation and improves myocardial metabolic and contractile dysfunction in ischemic hearts. BackgroundEither an ACE inhibitor or ARB mediates coronary vasodilation in ischemic hearts. MethodsIn dogs with myocardial ischemia, we infused an ACE inhibitor (<b>temocaprilat,</b> 10 Î¼g/kg/min) or ARB (RNH- 6270, 10 Î¼g/kg/min) into the coronary artery. ResultsPerfusion pressure of the left anterior descending coronary artery was reduced from 104 Â± 8 to 42 Â± 2 mm Hg, so that coronary blood flow (CBF) decreased to one-third of the baseline value. Ten minutes after starting the infusion of <b>temocaprilat,</b> the cardiac bradykinin level increased (from 32 Â± 6 to 98 Â± 5 pg/ml). Coronary blood flow (29 Â± 2 to 44 Â± 3 ml/ 100 g/min) and the cardiac level of nitric oxide (NO) (7. 8 Â± 1. 9 to 17. 5 Â± 3. 2 Î¼m) also increased, with these changes being attenuated by either NÏ‰-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester or HOE 140. RNH- 6270 alone caused a modest increase in CBF (34 Â± 3 ml/ 100 g/min), with no increase in the cardiac NO or bradykinin levels. Both <b>temocaprilat</b> and RNH- 6270 caused a further increase in both CBF (51 Â± 4 ml/ 100 g/min) and cardiac NO levels, without increasing the bradykinin level, and these changes were inhibited by HOE 140. In the nonischemic heart, RNH- 6270 augmented bradykinin-induced increases in CBF. ConclusionsThe combination of an ACE inhibitor and ARB mediates greater increases in CBF and more potent cardioprotective effects through bradykinin-dependent mechanisms than either drug alone...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of local}} {{endogenous}} angiotensin II (Ang II) in endothelial function in resistance arteries was investigated using rabbit mesenteric resistance arteries. First, {{the presence of}} immunoreactive Ang II together with Ang II type- 1 receptor (AT 1 R) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was confirmed in these arteries. In endothelium-intact strips, the AT 1 R-blocker olmesartan (1 Î¼m) and the ACE-inhibitor <b>temocaprilat</b> (1 Î¼m) each enhanced the ACh (0. 03 Î¼m) -induced relaxation during the contraction induced by noradrenaline (NA, 10 Î¼m). Similar effects were obtained using CV- 11974 (another AT 1 R blocker) and enalaprilat (another ACE inhibitor). The nitric-oxide-synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) abolished the above effect of olmesartan. In endothelium-denuded strips, olmesartan enhanced the relaxation induced by the NO donor NOC- 7 (10 nm). Olmesartan {{had no effect on}} cGMP production (1) in endothelium-intact strips (in the absence or presence of ACh) or (2) in endothelium-denuded strips (in the absence or presence of NOC- 7). In Î²-escin-skinned strips, 8 -bromoguanosine 3 â€², 5 â€² cyclic monophosphate (8 -Br-cGMP, 0. 01 â€“ 1 Î¼m) concentration dependently inhibited the contractions induced (a) by 0. 3 Î¼m Ca 2 + in the presence of NA+GTP and (b) by 0. 2 Î¼m Ca 2 ++GTPÎ³S. Olmesartan significantly enhanced, while Ang II (0. 1 nm) significantly inhibited, the 8 -Br-cGMP-induced relaxation. We propose the novel hypothesis that in these arteries, Ang II localized within smooth muscle cells activates AT 1 Rs and inhibits ACh-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation at least partly by inhibiting the action of cGMP on these cells...|$|E

" publisherSeveral {{clinical}} trials {{have demonstrated that}} angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) are equally effective {{in the treatment of}} chronic heart failure. However, this has not been confirmed for acute cardiac dysfunction. We examined whether ACEI or ARB prevents isoproterenol-induced acute left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dogs. LV dysfunction induced by a large dose of isoproterenol (1 ÂµgÂ·kg^â€“ 1 Â·min^â€“ 1, 3 -h infusion) was compared in dogs treated with ACEI (<b>temocaprilat)</b> or ARB (olmesartan). Atrial pacing induced a constant heart rate and use of adjustable aortic banding provided a nearly constant afterload. LV systolic function (LV dP/dt, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction) and diastolic function (Î³ and LV end-diastolic pressure) were significantly deteriorated after isoproterenol infusion. The LV dysfunction was almost totally prevented by ARB but was only partially prevented by ACEI. The partial effect of ACEI was complemented by cotreatment with HOE- 140, a bradykinin B_ 2 receptor antagonist. At baseline, the response to low doses of isoproterenol was significantly attenuated by ACEI but not by ARB, and the ACEI-induced attenuation was totally abolished by cotreatment with HOE- 140. The response to isoproterenol was significantly attenuated after 3 h of excess isoproterenol loading, and it was almost completely preserved by ARB but not by ACEI. In conclusion, acute LV dysfunction and Î²-adrenergic desensitization induced by excess isoproterenol administration were almost totally prevented by ARB but only partially prevented by ACEI. These differences were attributable at least in part to bradykinin pathways activated by ACEI administration in acute LV dysfunction...|$|E

However, to demonstrate that this in vitro system represents in vivo biliary excretion, it is essential to compare in vitro data with in vivo biliary excretion. The problem is that we cannot determine the human biliary excretion for many ligands. In the present study, we have established a double-transfected MDCK II monolayer that expresses both rat Oatp 4 /Slc 21 a 10 and Mrp 2 /Abcc 2 on the basal and apical membranes, respectively, for the purpose of quantitatively comparing the clearance for transcellular transport with that for in vivo biliary excretion. The basal-to-apical transport of 17 beta-estradiol- 17 beta-d-glucuronide, pravastatin, leukotriene C(4), cyclo-[D-Asp-Pro-d-Val-Leu-d-Trp] (BQ 123), <b>temocaprilat,</b> and taurolithocholate 3 -sulfate was significantly higher than that in the opposite direction in the double transfectant. Kinetic analysis suggested that that the rate-determining step of these compounds is the uptake process. The extent of the transcellular transport across the rat double-transfectant correlated well with that across the double-transfectant for human OATP 2 /SLC 21 A 6 and MRP 2 /ABCC 2. Moreover, considering the scaling factor, the clearance values for in vitro transcellular transport correlated well with those for in vivo biliary clearance. The double-transfected MDCK II monolayer may be useful in analyzing the hepatic vectorial transport of organic anions and in predicting in vivo biliary clearance...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II {{is known}} to enhance {{sympathetic}} neurotransmission in the vasculature by increasing the release of noradrenaline, but {{little is known about}} the effect on the co-released transmitter, adenosine 5 â€²-triphosphate (ATP). In the present study we have examined the effect of angiotensin II on the excitatory junction potential (e. j. p.) elicited by repetitive field stimulation in the guinea-pig isolated mesenteric artery, to establish the angiotensin II receptor subtype involved in modulating the release of ATP and the role of the endothelium in converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Suramin (300 [*]Î¼M), a P 2 purinoceptor antagonist, abolished both the e. j. ps and depolarizing response to Î±,Î²-methylene-ATP, a stable analogue of ATP, without affecting the resting membrane potential and noradrenaline-induced depolarization. Angiotensin II (0. 1 [*]Î¼M) affected neither the resting membrane potential nor the amplitude of the first e. j. p., but increased the amplitudes of the subsequent e. j. ps. This enhancing effect of angiotensin II was abolished by CV- 11974 (0. 1 [*]Î¼M), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor antagonist, but unaffected by PD[*] 123319 (1 [*]Î¼M), an angiotensin II type 2 (AT 2) receptor antagonist, or CGP[*] 42112 A (1 [*]Î¼M), AT 2 receptor ligand.

Removal of the endothelium did not alter the action of angiotensin I. The results of the present study indicate that the release of ATP from sympathetic nerves innervating the guinea-pig isolated mesenteric artery, as determined from the magnitude of the e. j. p., can be enhanced by angiotensin II via activation of prejunctional AT 1 receptors. Qualitatively similar effects were observed with angiotensin I, which appears to be converted into angiotensin II by a subendothelial process...|$|E
