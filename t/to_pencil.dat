5|$|Shortly {{after the}} final issue, G.I. Joe Special #1 was {{released}} in February 1995, containing alternate art for issue #61 by Todd McFarlane. McFarlane was the original penciller for issue #61, but his artwork had been rejected by Larry Hama as unacceptable, and so Marshall Rogers was brought in <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> the final published version. In the years following, McFarlane became a superstar comic artist, and Marvel eventually decided to print the unpublished work.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, long-time DC editor Murray Boltinoff {{took over}} the editing chores on Superboy from Weisinger {{starting}} with issue #149. (By this time, Adventure Comics was no longer publishing original Superboy stories.) Stories published under his editorial guidance usually included credits, making writers and artists easier to track. Frank Robbins, {{best known for his}} work (as both writer and artist) on Batman, began writing the Superboy strip with Boltinoff's debut as editor, and remained the primary scripter for three years. Penciler Bob Brown began one issue later, and continued <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> Superboy stories through the final Superboy feature in #197. Brown's pencils were inked by a number of artists, most notably Murphy Anderson from 1970-1973, who was simultaneously inking Curt Swan's pencils on Superman. After Robbins left, Leo Dorfman returned as the writer for Superboy, with occasional scripts by Bridwell and, toward the end, Cary Bates, later famous for his Superman stories. Boltinoff also made the editorial decision to switch the Legion backup feature from Action Comics to Superboy in 1971, and later to make the Legion feature the sole feature in the comic.|$|E
25|$|Kollam is {{the largest}} pencil slat {{manufacturing}} hub in India. There are more than 150 slat production units in the city employing roughly 5,000 persons. A {{good portion of the}} demand for pencil slats in the country is met by these units. 35% of the world's pencil slats are manufactured in Kerala. Of the 170 odd pencil slat manufacturing units in Kerala, 125 are based in and around Kollam district. These units export 160 loads of slats per month to companies across the world. This, according to slat manufacturers, is enough to make 200 million pencils per month. A slat is of 185mm length, 77mm width and 5.5mm thickness. Each load exported contains 300 bags with 900 slats bundled into each. On an average each month 150 loads of pencil slats are shipped <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> factories based in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and various places in Gujarat. Over 30 countries depend on Kollam's pencil slat manufacturers for pencil making under different brand names. These factories are working with the support of their associations: the Kerala Slats Factories Association and the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA). Most of the important employees of these associations are from Kollam.|$|E

500|$|Archie Comics {{proposed}} the crossover to 20th Century Fox, {{who owns the}} Predator character, and Dark Horse Comics, who had licensed the character for comic books. Both quickly agreed. Dark Horse approached Alex de Campi to write based on her work on the horror comic book Grindhouse and the humorous comic book [...] Dark Horse editor Brendan Wright, who was already editing the regular Predator comic book and had previously coordinated with Archie Comics on Dark Horse's Archie Archives reprints, was chosen as editor. Ruiz {{was the first and}} only artist considered <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> the series, and inker Rich Koslowski was selected based on his work with Ruiz on a Thor parody in Archie #648.

500|$|Adams' art {{style is}} {{noted for its}} high level of detail, {{and he has a}} {{reputation}} of being a [...] "tight" [...] penciller. He states that he works at a slow pace, which limits the amount of work he does. When he penciled Fantastic Four #347–349 in 1990 for regular writer/illustrator Walter Simonson, who needed a break in order to catch up on his own work on that title, Adams managed <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> the first two issues in five weeks and four weeks, respectively, but was considerably late on the third. In 1997 Adams stated that he could produce a page of either pencils or inks in a day. In a 2007 interview, he stated he tends to produce ⅔ to ¾ of a page a day, and can also ink at that rate, but can do up to two pages in a day if he is under pressure, as when he produced Cloak and Dagger #9 (1986) in 22 days, for example. Another example is the 1989 one-shot , which due to changing deadlines, he completed at a quicker pace. Adams singles out one page of that book that he drew a half-hour as his personal record for speed, but decries its poor quality. Adams is also noted for the humor in his work, as with, for example, the extraneous characters he places in cameo appearances in the backgrounds of his comics, as when he drew Gumby in the panels of Longshot, or the forms in which he depicted the shapeshifting alien Warlock in his The New Mutants work.|$|E

[...] While freelancing for National Comics Publications, the future DC Comics, Kirby drew 20 stories for Atlas from 1956 to 1957: Beginning with the five-page [...] "Mine Field" [...] in Battleground #14 (Nov.1956), Kirby penciled and in some cases inked (with his wife, Roz) and wrote stories of the Western hero Black Rider, the Fu Manchu-like Yellow Claw, and more.

60|$|One day Androcles was {{gathering}} truffles in a forest, {{when he found}} a lion's den; and, walking into it, he lay down and slept. It was a custom, in his time, to sleep in lions' dens when practicable. The lion was absent, inspecting a zoological garden, and did not return until late; but he did return. He {{was surprised to find}} a stranger in his menagerie without a ticket; but, supposing him to be some contributor to a comic paper, did not eat him: he was very well satisfied not to be eaten by him. Presently Androcles awoke, wishing he had some seltzer water, or something. (Seltzer water is good after a night's debauch, and something--it is difficult to say what--is good to begin the new debauch with). Seeing the lion eyeing him, he began hastily <b>to</b> <b>pencil</b> his last will and testament upon the rocky floor of the den. What was his surprise to see the lion advance amicably and extend his right forefoot! Androcles, however, was equal to the occasion: he met the friendly overture with a cordial grasp of the hand, whereat the lion howled--for he had a carpet-tack in his foot. Perceiving that he had made a little mistake, Androcles made such reparation as was in his power by pulling out the tack and putting it in his own foot.|$|E

60|$|Then, as her {{butterfly}} acquaintances deserted her, {{she found}} her way into a hive of friendly bees, who welcomed her, and showed her {{how to find the}} honey that keeps life sweet and wholesome. Through Miss Mills, who was the counsellor and comforter of several, Polly came to know a little sisterhood of busy, happy, independent girls, who each had a purpose to execute, a talent to develop, an ambition to achieve, and brought to the work patience and perseverance, hope and courage. Here Polly found her place at once, for in this little world love and liberty prevailed; talent, energy, and character took the first rank; money, fashion, and position were literally nowhere; for here, as in the big world outside, genius seemed to blossom best when poverty was head gardener. Young teachers, doing much work for little pay; young artists, trying <b>to</b> <b>pencil,</b> paint, or carve their way to Rome; young writers, burning to distinguish themselves; young singers, dreaming of triumphs, great as those of Jenny Lind; and some who tried to conquer independence, armed only with a needle, like poor Jane. All these helped Polly as unconsciously as she helped them, for purpose and principle are the best teachers we can have, and the want of them makes half the women of America what they are, restless, aimless, frivolous, and sick.|$|E
6000|$|An hour passed, and {{the downstairs}} {{rooms at the}} hotel grew dim and were almost deserted, while the little box-like squares above them were brilliantly irradiated.

The thump of jugs set down on the floor above could be heard and the clink of china, for there was not as thick a {{partition}} between the rooms as one might wish, so Miss Allan, the elderly lady who had been playing bridge, determined, giving the wall a smart rap with her knuckles. It was only matchboard, she decided, run up to make many little rooms of one large one.

She was reading the [...] "Prelude," [...] partly because she always read the [...] "Prelude" [...] abroad, and partly because she was engaged in writing a short Primer of English Literature--Beowulf to Swinburne--which would have a paragraph on Wordsworth.

Whose boots were they, she wondered. She then became aware of a swishing sound next door--a woman, clearly, putting away her dress.
