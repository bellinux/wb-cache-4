5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
25|$|The {{finding of}} coccoid {{bacteria}} on a pap test {{is of no}} consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would otherwise. If there are symptoms of vaginal discharge, bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> takes to sing... I regard [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo and Zizz Studio, with Abo composing 21 of the songs. While {{it was common}} for games in the genre to have music that is played in several scenes, Abo had to compose several songs that specifically matched certain individual scenes that were intended to be shocking and dark. He described the main image for the game's sound as [...] "rainy", compared to the later Science Adventure games Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes and Chaos;Child, which he called [...] "cloudy", [...] "clear weather" [...] and [...] "stormy", respectively. In preparation for composing the music, Abo read the game's story to understand the setting and the character personalities as much as possible. He wrote down his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and of the events and situations throughout the story, and used them to create a musical worldview for the game. He said that this approach takes more <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> would to just designate songs to the different areas in the game, but that it {{made it possible to}} create better songs with a greater relationship to the game's worldview.|$|E

2500|$|According to the IUCN, the Balantiopteryx plicata {{is rated}} as [...] "least concern" [...] because the species {{has a wide}} range and usually resides in {{protected}} areas. Little {{is known about the}} specific numbers of Balantiopteryx plicata, so a population trend cannot be deduced. It prefers to live near the mouth of caves, in barns and other buildings; usually in areas that are open and lit. The bat is sociable and is usually {{part of a group of}} fifty or more. It has also been reported that the colony can include up to 10,000 bats. In the colony, there are approximately 25% females and 75% males. These statistics are variable – another source described how the males were more likely to be a part of the colony at the beginning of the dry season around mating <b>time</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> is to be near the rainy season; most of the females stayed in one roost while the males left for other roosts. It also prefers to live in dry areas or arid climates rather than wet climates, so it would more likely to be found in evergreen forests rather than swamps. It is necessary to have at least 25% humidity, and preferable to have multiple exits in the structure of the roost. When they roost, they stay about twenty centimeters apart - except when young are present - and they all face the same way. The bats do not seem to be territorial, and also share roosts with other species of bat.|$|E
