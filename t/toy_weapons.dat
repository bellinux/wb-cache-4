500|$|Referring to the {{historical}} comparison between the Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto series, Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer wrote that Grand Theft Auto IV serious turn let the Saints Row series be a [...] "gleeful silly sandbox game", and noted that Saints Row: The Third was [...] "marketed almost exclusively" [...] based on its wackiness, from the costumes to the sex <b>toy</b> <b>weapons.</b> He felt that the [...] "wacky hijinks" [...] quickly became [...] "predictable and repetitive" [...] and the activities felt [...] "sanitized and generic". Edge wrote that they were [...] "one-off gags". Eurogamer Whitehead added that the tiger escort Guardian Angel missions appeared to draw from Will Ferrell's Talladega Nights, and that the Prof. Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax shooting gallery drew from Bizarre Creations' The Club shooter. Eurogamer and PC Gamer both found the game easy.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the game}} wasn't shown at E3 2010, THQ spoke of {{extensive}} tie-in merchandising (collectible card game, books) and a Saints Row film in production {{as part of}} a [...] "robust transmedia play". Instead, THQ announced Saints Row: Drive By, a tie-in game for the Nintendo 3DS and Xbox Live Arcade that would unlock content in Saints Row 3. After the game was announced in March 2011, it was featured on the cover of Game Informer April issue. Closer to release, THQ sent rap group the Broken Pixels a development kit with a pre-release version of the game and asked them to record track about [...] "all the wacky things" [...] to do in the game. The group wrote the rap in a day and later produced a YouTube video set to clips from the game. THQ hosted an event in Redfern, Australia where women in skintight clothes pumped free gas for three hours, which generated an estimated 35 times return on investment. Eurogamer recalled that the game was [...] "marketed almost exclusively on the basis of all the wacky stuff it will let you do" [...] from the costumes to the sex <b>toy</b> <b>weapons,</b> and Edge described Saints Row: The Third as [...] "marketed by sex toys and porn stars".|$|E

2500|$|The series, and {{particularly}} the live-action Apes television show and the Return to the Planet of the Apes cartoon, generated numerous toy and merchandising tie-ins. During the 1970s, Fox licensed around 60 companies to produce about 300 different Apes products, including action figures and playsets, model building kits, coloring books, book-and-record sets, trading cards, <b>toy</b> <b>weapons,</b> costumes, apparel, branded tableware, and lunch boxes. This level of merchandising was unusual for the time, {{and the success of}} Apes merchandise may have inspired the campaigns that later became commonplace for films and television series. The action figures, sold by Mego beginning in 1973, were the first such toys sold as film tie-ins; they proved popular and inspired the rise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises. Eric Greene writes that Apes toys were popular enough to lead some contemporary children to engage in apes-vs.-humans role-playing make believe games that simulated the series' conflicts {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Cowboys and Indians". With the release of the 21st-century films, Fox licensed several companies to manufacture new Apes toys, including detailed action figures of new and [...] "classic" [...] characters sold as collectibles.|$|E
