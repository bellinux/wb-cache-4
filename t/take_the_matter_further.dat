40|$|Local government’s newly {{acquired}} {{status as a}} fully-fledged sphere of government with constitutionally protected powers is slowly gaining momentum. Now that the dust is slowly settling around the demarcation and establishment of local government institutions, the demarcation of local government powers visà- vis other spheres of government is fast becoming a critical area of academic research and intergovernmental dialogue. As they become aware of their constitutional scope, municipalities will start asserting their institutional integrity with powerful metropolitan municipalities taking the lead. In an earlier article in this journal, the approach to local government powers {{as set out in}} the Constitution was outlined. 1 This article <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>further</b> and presents a case study on the demarcation of local government powers in one specific area, namely the regulation of the liquor retail industry. In the Liquor Bill judgment of 2000 more clarity was provided about national versus provincial powers regarding the liquor retail industry. 2 Another important issue is the division between provincial and local powers. Schedule 5 A of the Constitution lists ‘Liquor licences’ as a provincial competency. Schedule 5 B of the Constitution lists ‘Control of undertakings that sell liquor to the public’ as a local government competency. This apparent overlap in the constitutional regime on provincial and local legislative powers over liquor retail matters raises two demarcation issues. The first demarcation issue is: {{what is the difference between}} ‘Liquor licences’ (a provincial competency) and ‘Control of undertakings that sell liquor to the public’ (a local government competency) ? This question will be dealt with in sections 2 and 3 of this article. Department of HE and Training approved lis...|$|R

The charges arose because membership of a student association was at the time considered sufficient to support them. The defendants were convicted and faced several years of detention. Schaffrath succeeded in obtaining their acquittal at an appeal hearing before the High Court ("Königlich-Sächsische Oberappellationsgericht") at Dresden. He then <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> a stage <b>further</b> by publishing a report of the case.

50|$|Although {{the notion}} of {{erecting}} a monument in commemoration of the Voortrekkers had already been mentioned by president Paul Kruger at Blood River in 1888, the idea only really came to fruition in 1930 when {{a small group of}} Afrikaners led by the famous painter Pierneef decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>further</b> in a coordinated manner under the leadership of the FAK. On 4 April 1931 the Sentrale Volksmonumentekomitee (Central People's Monuments Committee) was founded in Bloemfontein, the FAK's first committee. The purpose of the commission was to strive towards the erection of a monument in light of the Great Trek centenary of 1938, as well as for other approved monuments. The result was the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, Blood River Monument, Voortrekker Monument in Winburg and the statue of Piet Retief at the Covenant Church in Pietermaritzburg.|$|E

50|$|However, Polesworth Abbey in Warwickshire {{seems to}} have had a special {{relationship}} with the Bishops, Northburgh included, through most of the 14th century and enjoyed unusual favour. One of Northburgh's earliest measures after taking up the see was to grant extraordinary pastoral and liturgical powers to Maud, the abbess-elect. In September 1327 the Pope wrote to the Bishop of Hereford asking him to intervene and secure justice between the rector of Eyton in Shropshire and the abbess of Polesworth. Northburgh had forced Thomas, the rector, to swear to pay the abbess two thirds of his income as a pension before allowing him to be inducted. On taking up the post, Thomas found the remaining third of the revenue insufficient to support him. The Pope had already intervened, ordering members of the Lichfield chapter to annul the oath: Richard Bernard, the Archdeacon of Salop, William de Bosco, the Chancellor, and Gilbert de Bruer, prebendary of Wolvey. He had also ordered the abbess to take the matter no further. However, she had got judgement against Thomas in the secular courts, claiming that the pension was a charge on the rectory instituted by Walter Langton, Northburgh's predecessor. Moreover, the Chancellor and Bruer had delegated their powers to Roger le Mareschall, the prebendary of Dernford, and he and Bernard refused to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>further.</b> Once Thomas appealed to the Pope, the abbess had deprived him of his rectory and given it to William de Ipstones. Nothing more is reported of the case. When Northburgh visited the abbey in 1352 he found little to remark upon. He had his injunctions delivered in French, as was now the custom with women's houses.|$|E

40|$|Tasks {{that rely}} on {{semantic}} content of documents, notably Information Retrieval and Document Classification, can benefit from a good account of document context, i. e. the semantic association between documents. To this effect, the scheme of latent semantics blends individual words appearing throughout a document collection into latent topics, thus providing a way to handle documents that is less constrained than the conventional approach by the mere appearance of such or such word. Probabilistic latent semantic models <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>further</b> by providing assumptions on how the documents observed in the collection would have been generated. This allows derivation of inference algorithms that can fit the model parameters to the observed document collection; with their values set, these parameters can then be used to compute the similarities between documents. The Fisher kernels, similarity functions rooted in information geometry, constitute good candidates to measure the similarity between documents {{in the framework of}} probabilistic latent semantic models. In this context, we study the use of Fisher kernels for the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) model. By thouroughly analysing the generative process of PLSI, we derive the proper Fisher kernel for PLSI and expose the hypotheses that relate former work to this kernel. In particular, w...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} an outdoor game played by children aged 6 - 12 years {{in urban areas}} of Scotland in the 1950 s. It also describes some of the unfortunate conditions experienced by modern children in childhood despite the major technical and societal advantages in the last 60 years. The paper goes on to suggest some benefits of resurrecting the original game and it describes a possible re-fashioning of {{the game with a}} modern aspect. It concludes with some reservations and invitations to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>further.</b> Key words: Children, games, play, learning, outdoors. 1. Preamble The work reported here is part of a small portfolio of research collaborations between the Centre for the Study of Natural Design (CSND) and Scottish Outdoor Education Centers (SOEC), a charitable organisation concerned with environmental and outdoor learning for children primarily between the ages of 7 and 12 years. It has five centres in Scotland and handles about 20, 000 children per annum. The aim of the work at SOEC, in addition to environmental learning, is to build capacity in young children for confidence, skills, teamwork and early citizenship. This paper reports on a study at the early stages. Its future direction will depend on the response from others at this conference and elsewhere. It could, for example, develop into a full study involving historical, social, design and technical research. At the moment, the work is conceptual and the evidence comes primarily from the childhood experience of one of the authors (S. B.). 2...|$|E
