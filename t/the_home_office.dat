5|$|During this process, <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Walter Long of Gillingham, Dorset {{objected to}} the giant's nudity and {{conducted}} a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed obscenity with a leaf. Long's protest gained some support, including that of two bishops, and eventually reached <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E

In 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire, reportedly to the disappointment of the local council.|$|E

5|$|A {{scene in}} the pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later.

A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> and Lindemann's office.

5|$|David Bell, <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

Another evaluation report undertaken for <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E

His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Office.</b> On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.|$|E
