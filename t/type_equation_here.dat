G 2 manifolds We first review the basic results about G 2 manifolds, along the way we give a self contained proof of the McLean’s theorem and its generalization [M], [AS 1]. A G 2 manifold (M, ϕ, Λ) with an oriented 2 -plane field gives various complex structures on some of subbundles of T(M). This imposes interesting structures on the deformation theory of its associative submanifolds. By using this we relate them to the Seiberg-Witten <b>type</b> <b>equations.</b> Let us recall some basic definitions (c. f.

The imaginary octonions imO = R 7 is equipped with the cross product operation × : R 7 ×R 7 → R 7 defined by u ×v = im(¯v. u). The exceptional Lie group G 2 is the linear automorphisms of imO preserving this cross product.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{asymptotic distribution}} of characteristic constants in periodic and antiperiodic boundary-value {{problems for the}} second-order linear equation with periodic coefficients. It allows getting asymptotics of stability and instability zones of solutions. It was shown that {{in the absence of}} turning points (r(t) > 0) the instability zones lengths converge to zero with their number increasing, and the stability zones lengths converge to a positive quantity. The situation, when (r(t) ≥ 0) and there are zeroes r(t), results {{in the fact that the}} lengths of stability and instability zones have a finite nonzero bound at an unbounded increase of the number of the corresponding zone. But if the function r(t) is alternating, the lengths of all stability zones converge to zero, and the lengths of instability zones converge to some finite quantities. These conclusions allowed to formulate a series of interesting criteria of stability and instability of solutions of the second-order equation with periodic coefficients. The results given are illustrated by a substantial example. The methods of investigation are based on a detailed study of the so-called special standard equations and the consequent reduction of original equations to any particular <b>type</b> of standard <b>equations.</b> <b>Here,</b> asymptotic methods of the theory of singular perturbance, as well as certain properties of a series of special functions are used. </p...|$|R
