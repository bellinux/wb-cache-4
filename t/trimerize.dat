To investigate the role of VP 7 oligomerization in core assembly, a series of residues for substitution were predicted based on crystal structures of BTV type 10 VP 7 molecule targeting the monomer-monomer contacts within the trimer. Seven site-specific substitution mutations of VP 7 have been created using cDNA clones and were employed to produce seven recombinant baculoviruses. The effects of these mutations on VP 7 solubility, ability to <b>trimerize</b> and formation of core-like particles (CLPs) {{in the presence of the}} scaffolding VP 3 protein, were investigated. Of the seven VP 7 mutants examined, three severely affected the stability of CLP, while two other mutants had lesser effect on CLP stability.

One mutant in which the conserved tyrosine at residue 271 (lower domain helix 6) was replaced by arginine formed insoluble aggregates, implying an effect in the folding of the molecule despite the prediction that such a change would be accommodated. All six soluble VP 7 mutants were purified, and their ability to <b>trimerize</b> was examined. All mutants, including those that did not form stable CLPs, assembled into stable trimers, implying that single substitution may not be sufficient to perturb the complex monomer-monomer contacts, although subtle changes within the VP 7 trimer could destabilize the core.
