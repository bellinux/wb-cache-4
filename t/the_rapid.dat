50|$|Arguably {{the biggest}} {{attraction}} to Pony Pasture is <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> A class II, <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> {{are part of}} the James River’s main channel. With the aid of park volunteers and funding from area recycling projects, easy access was made to <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> <b>The</b> Park System helped to create the access to <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> in order to ensure an easy place to raft, kayak, and canoe. The stairs that lead directly into the river are also fully equipped with a canoe launch, suitable for kayaks and rafts alike. Rafters will often start at Pony Pasture or even further up the James and venture until Belle Isle, one of Richmond’s main river entrances. Access to <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> is free, but rafting is prohibited if the water level is too high. Aside from Belle Isle, the majority of kayak, paddle, and raft trips that start at Pony Pasture typically end at Pipeline Rapids or Reedy Creek. <b>The</b> <b>rapids</b> are a very popular part of Pony Pasture and helped to establish the name “Pony Pasture Rapids”.|$|R
50|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> <b>the</b> {{river is}} several {{kilometers}} wide. At <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> it narrows {{to less than}} one kilometer. A rock ridge extends into the river channel, from the east bank. Boater can avoid the rocks by sticking to the west bank.|$|R

2500|$|For a steamer move upriver through <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> on <b>the</b> Snake River, It was {{necessary}} to [...] "line" [...] through <b>the</b> <b>rapids.</b> [...] Lining consisted of running a cable out from a winch on the steamer to a bolt secured in a rock on the shore.

5000|$|The river then {{continues}} to Avesta where it strongly changes character. It leaves a deep valley and enters into a flat country, uniquely marked by some eskers. During the remaining 120 km that it {{travels to the}} sea, the river, now called the Lower Dalälven (Nedre Dalälven), alternates between large bays (...) and rapids. This section is also characterized by regular flooding, sometimes over vast areas. <b>The</b> first <b>rapids</b> are those at Avesta, called Storfors and Lillfors (big chute and little chute), after which the river forms the lake Bäsingen, then <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> Näs bruk, then the lake Bysjön. It forms the frontier between Västmanland County {{to the south and}} Dalarna County to the north. It then forms <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> at Tyttbo, and right after, one of its larges fjärds, that of Färnebofjärden National Park, forming the frontier between Uppsala County to the south and Gävleborg County to the north. More than 200 islands are strewn over this fjärd. The river continues to <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> at Gysinge and then another great fjärd, Hedesundafjärden-Bramsöfjärden. The river passes through <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> at Söderfors towards Untrafjärden, then by <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> of Untra towards Marmafjärden, and then <b>the</b> <b>rapids</b> of Lanforsen. Finally, goes through its last rapids at Älvkarleby before rejoining the Baltic Sea.|$|R
