On 16 May 1648 {{he was one of the}} many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody, but he was quickly ransomed. He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress, which {{surrendered}} on 26 September; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Zborov. He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorągiew of hetman Mikołaj Potocki, a military judge deputized by the hetman, and a member of his staff, meeting with the new king of Poland, John Casimir Vasa. He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651. He received the title of chorąży of Sandomierz, and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652. According to Nagielski, Czarniecki, while returning from the Sejm, witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh; This scene made him reject the notions that a compromise with the enemies of the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome. Podhorodecki however notes that another historian, Wojciech Jacek Długołecki, questions Czarniecki's presence there, and concludes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh, The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred; illustrating that is a letter Czariecki wrote soon after the battle, in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him, he will leave few Ruthenians alive.|$|E

She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can tell you now, in case you are not informed, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> money in Florence..."

500|$|In 1998, Hawke {{appeared}} alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro in Great Expectations, {{a contemporary}} film {{adaptation of the}} Charles Dickens novel of the same name, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. During the same year, Hawke collaborated with Linklater again on The Newton Boys, based on {{the true story of}} the Newton Gang. Critical reviews for both films were mixed. The following year, Hawke starred in Snow Falling on Cedars, based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. The film met with an unenthusiastic reception; Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does." ...|$|E

500|$|Chronicle {{sources for}} the life of Æthelstan are limited, and the first biography, by Sarah Foot, was only {{published}} in 2011. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Æthelstan's reign is principally devoted to military events, and it is largely silent apart from recording his most important victories. An important source is the twelfth-century chronicle of William of Malmesbury, but historians are cautious about accepting his testimony, much of which cannot be verified from other sources. David Dumville {{goes so far as to}} dismiss William's account entirely, regarding him as a [...] "treacherous witness" [...] whose account is unfortunately influential. However, Sarah Foot is inclined to accept Michael Wood's argument that William's chronicle draws on a lost life of Æthelstan. She cautions, however, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> means of discovering how far William [...] "improved" [...] on the original.|$|E
500|$|The Devastation class {{became more}} popular among the {{civilian}} population and in the Royal Navy as the ships got older.

500|$|This episode marked Hardin's first {{appearance}} as Deep Throat. Series creator Chris Carter {{stated that the}} character {{was inspired by the}} historical Deep Throat, an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. Carter created the character {{to bridge the gap between}} Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep Throat as a man [...] "who works in some level of government <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea exists". Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in The Firm, and described the casting as an [...] "easy choice". Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal [...] "very, very good".|$|E

500|$|However, in {{the face}} of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley's words, that [...] "his life as a Christian is no more {{sheltered}} from this world's tragedies than it was before." [...] Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of theodicy, the question of why evil exists that is commonly faced by Christians. Scholar Richard Leonard writes, [...] "For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question.... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events to teach us something." [...] Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, [...] "The message of this film is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> final assurances, any more than Abraham did. But we can respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{has stated}} that the {{character}} of Deep Throat was [...] "of course" [...] inspired by the historical Deep Throat. The real Deep Throat was an informant leaking information on the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. After the conclusion of The X-Files, this Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence on the fictional Deep Throat was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. In the film, Sutherland's X reveals information {{about the possibility that}} the assassination of John F. Kennedy was orchestrated by elements within the American government. Carter felt he needed to create a character who would bridge the gap between FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and the shadowy conspirators who were working against them; he conceived of a character [...] "who works in some level of government <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea exists".|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E

500|$|The same year, Holmes was {{approached}} by Martin Delany, an African-American man {{who had worked with}} Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, [...] "Let me try to improve and please my fellowmen after my own fashion at present." [...] Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.|$|E
500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is to say, we are ready except <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort and it is my desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|E

2500|$|His first {{objection}} is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{experience of}} world-making. Hume highlighted {{the fact that}} everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know {{it has to be}} created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way [...] that a watch has.|$|E
