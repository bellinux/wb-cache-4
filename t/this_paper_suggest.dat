40|$|The main {{findings}} of <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>suggest</b> that the 2012 VAT reform held in Spain {{has a negative}} effect on redistribution on income but no effect over the progressivity of the tax system. The non-effect over progressivity is because tax rate structure has increased the gap between the different rates, the general rate increases 3 points, from 18 % to 21 % meanwhile the reduced rate only incresead 2 points from 8 % to 10 %. Finally the super reduced stayed fixed at 4 %. Howeber the reforms still show a negative redistribution effect. Using the marginal tax reforms approach, particularly the Gini income elasticity, I can design a new VAT structure that achieves tax revenue targets {{and at the same time}} improves progressitivy an the redistribution effect of VAT. Therefore <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>suggest</b> that a better VAT reform could have been implemented in Spain...|$|E

It identifies several “classification factors ” or attributes on which entrepreneurial activities can be classified into archetypes, and identifies ten classes of archetypical entrepreneurial activities. This typology can help empirical researchers include in studies only those entrepreneurial activities they wish to examine. It is also a useful teaching tool, helping students understand the different types of “entrepreneurship. ...|$|R

40|$|Using both quantity- and price-based {{measures}} of financial integration, this paper shows an increasing degree of financial openness and integration in emerging Asian markets. This paper also assesses {{the impact of}} a regional shock relative to a global shock on local equity and bond markets. The findings of <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>suggest</b> that the region 2 ̆ 019 s equity markets are integrated more globally than regionally, although the degrees of both regional and global integration have increased significantly since the 1997 / 98 Asian financial crisis. However, emerging Asia 2 ̆ 019 s local currency bond markets remain generally segmented, being neither regionally nor globally integrated. A case can be made for the benefits of increased regional integration of financial markets. Financial integration at the regional level allows for the region 2 ̆ 019 s economies to benefit from allocation efficiency and risk diversification. The findings of <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>suggest</b> that policymakers in the region must strike the right balance between maximizing the net benefits from regional and global financial openness, and minimizing the potential costs of financial contagion and crisis...|$|E
