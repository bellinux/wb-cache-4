5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate as a function of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables.</b> The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Of {{all three}} {{factors that affect}} cost, street width, street length and {{pavement}} width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables,</b> though optional, can play a role.|$|E
25|$|Peer-reviewed {{research}} undertaken {{since then}} has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem {{in and of itself}} has no positive effect on grades. Roy Baumeister has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades. The relationship involving self-esteem and academic results does not signify that high self-esteem contributes to high academic results. It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.|$|E

25|$|The ELEMENT study {{dealt with}} {{determinants}} {{of academic achievement}} in Berlin. It {{was carried out in}} Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil's parents, for example, is correlated with the parents' education. Because of this Multiple Regression Analysis was used. Multiple Regression allows us to understand the influence of one variable when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> are held fixed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in x'j, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of x'j to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of x'j can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained {{a great deal of the}} variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by x'j. In this case, including <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to x'j, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with x'j.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|E

5000|$|... {{whenever}} [...] and [...] In {{the case}} of complex Hilbert spaces, we use a Hermitian inner product; it will be conjugate-linear (complex anti-linear) in u (math convention) or v (physics convention), and complex-linear in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R
500|$|It {{is perhaps}} {{more common in}} the thermal domain to choose {{temperature}} and thermal power as the fundamental variables because, unlike entropy, they can be measured directly. [...] The concept of thermal resistance is based on this analogy. [...] However, these are not power conjugate variables and are not fully compatible with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> in the table. [...] An integrated electrical analogy across multiple domains that includes this thermal analogy will not correctly model energy flows.|$|E
2500|$|... {{is called}} the regressand, {{endogenous}} variable, response variable, measured variable, criterion variable, or dependent variable [...] (see dependent and independent variables). The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled {{as the dependent variable}} and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables.</b> Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{groups have}} great ideological, political, financial, and {{emotional}} investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws {{have a vested}} interest in showing that [...] "their" [...] laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other side of the issue, low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage. The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> that affect employment.|$|E
50|$|Next, {{subtract}} {{one of the}} {{two variables}} from 100. Then subtract the difference from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable.</b> That difference will be the first two digits of your final product. And the resulting 4 digit number will be the final product.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} inverse {{proportionality}} can be contrasted with direct proportionality. Consider two variables {{said to be}} [...] "inversely proportional" [...] to each other. If all <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> are held constant, the magnitude or absolute value of one inversely proportional <b>variable</b> decreases if <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> increases, while their product (the constant of proportionality k) is always the same.|$|R
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause in {{which one of the}} clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.|$|R
2500|$|Locus {{of control}} was {{originally}} {{not included in}} the list of traits that would make up core self-evaluations. [...] It was added as a consideration later because [...] "it generally meets the criteria set forth by Judge et al. (1997)" [...] of being a core self-evaluation trait. [...] Later, although some researchers agreed that it was less self-oriented than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> because it has an external dimension, it became a part of the theory for two primary reasons: [...] 1) Its scale measured many self-oriented items, and 2) because it was conceptually and empirically related to generalized self-efficacy (a meta-analysis confirms a correlation of [...]56, one of the lowest correlations between CSE traits).|$|E
2500|$|In {{regression}} analysis the researcher specifies an empirical model. For example, {{a very common}} model is the straight line model {{which is used to}} test if there is a linear relationship between dependent and independent variable. If a linear relationship is found to exist, the variables are said to be correlated. However, correlation does not prove causation, as both variables may be correlated with other, hidden, variables, or the dependent variable may [...] "reverse" [...] cause the independent variables, or the variables may be otherwise spuriously correlated. [...] For example, suppose there is a correlation between deaths by drowning and the volume of ice cream sales at a particular beach. Yet, both the number of people going swimming and the volume of ice cream sales increase as the weather gets hotter, and presumably the number of deaths by drowning is correlated with the number of people going swimming. Perhaps an increase in swimmers causes both <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> to increase.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, every median graph {{must be the}} retract of a hypercube. [...] This may be {{seen from}} the connection, {{described}} above, between median graphs and 2-satisfiability: let G be the graph of solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance; without loss of generality this instance can be formulated {{in such a way that}} no two variables are always equal or always unequal in every solution. [...] Then the space of all truth assignments to the variables of this instance forms a hypercube. [...] For each clause, formed as the disjunction of two variables or their complements, in the 2-satisfiability instance, one can form a retraction of the hypercube in which truth assignments violating this clause are mapped to truth assignments in which both variables satisfy the clause, without changing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> in the truth assignment. [...] The composition of the retractions formed in this way for each of the clauses gives a retraction of the hypercube onto the solution space of the instance, and therefore gives a representation of G as the retract of a hypercube. [...] In particular, median graphs are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes, and are therefore partial cubes. [...] However, not all partial cubes are median graphs; for instance, a six-vertex cycle graph is a partial cube but is not a median graph.|$|E
5000|$|In each case, the {{parameters}} for the distribution {{over one of}} the variables depend on expectations taken with respect to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable.</b> We can expand the expectations, using the standard formulas for the expectations of moments of the Gaussian and gamma distributions: ...|$|R

40|$|The partial {{regression}} coefficient is also called regression coefficient, regression weight, {{partial regression}} weight, slope coefficient or partial slope coefficient.

This coefficient is called partial because its value depends, in general, upon <b>the</b> <b>other</b> independent <b>variables.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> value of the partial coefficient for one independent variable will vary, in general, depending upon <b>the</b> <b>other</b> independent <b>variables</b> included in the regression equatio...|$|R

50|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the marginal distribution of {{a subset of}} a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset.

The variance decomposition indicates the amount of information each variable contributes to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables</b> in the autoregression. It determines how much of the forecast error variance of each of the variables can be explained by exogenous shocks to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} type is the Pearson {{correlation}}. The sign of correlation coefficient (+, −) defines {{the direction of the}} relationship, either positive or negative. A positive correlation coefficient means that as the value of one variable increases, the value of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> increases; as one decreases, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> decreases.
