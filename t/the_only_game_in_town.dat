50|$|Because of Great Britain's tax laws, {{the stars}} {{insisted that the}} film be shot in Paris, which added to the film's budget, already {{inflated}} by their salaries ($1 million for Harrison, $1.25 million for Burton).

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Game</b> <b>in</b> <b>Town</b> is {{the third}} book of the Spirit Flyer Series by John Bibee. The book was {{published}} by Inter-Varsity Press in 1988. This {{is the first of}} the Spirit Flyer Series of books that does not focus exclusively on the expoits of the Kramar family. The protagonist of <b>The</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Game</b> <b>in</b> <b>Town</b> is Daniel Bayley, a young boy that recently moved to the fictional town of Centerville. The book centers on Daniel's struggles over whether to join the evil but tempting Cobra Club or align himself with the children who ride the Spirit Flyer bicycles. At the local toy store, run by Mrs. Happy, a Big Board is installed to help the townspeople keep track of their points so that everyone would know who was really on top. The Big Board is unlike anything that anyone has seen before and it measures everything from personality points to grade points and judged everyone in the town on a point scale. Daniel found himself at the bottom of this game. He was new in town and he had a limp. He felt {{that there was no way}} he could win until Mrs. Happy offered to help make him the envy of every child in Centerville. The decision had the possibility of ruining his relationship with John and Susan Kramar and their Spirit Flyer bicycles. The story is an allegorical representation of Christianity and is aimed at young readers.|$|E
