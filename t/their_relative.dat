As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{discharge}} process (DP) {{is full of}} well-known risks, and a comprehensive and well-executed DP {{is especially important for}} older people with multiple health problems and continuing care needs, as well as for <b>their</b> <b>relatives.</b> Few studies focus on the experiences with the DP by older people in need of home care nursing and <b>their</b> <b>relatives.</b> Therefore, the aim was to deepen the understanding of the DP as a phenomenon described by older people, <b>their</b> <b>relatives,</b> and care professionals. The method is an excursus of the findings of two previously published research studies. By using the Reflective Lifeworld Research approach, the empirical findings were further interpreted with lifeworld theory. The results describe the essential meaning of the phenomenon of DP in relation to healthcare needs. The illness and the DP {{can be viewed as a}} course of action where the familiar becomes unfamiliar for older people and <b>their</b> <b>relatives,</b> entailing an insecure future existence characterized by the experience of being in-between. The DP is marked by bodily and existential needs. The older persons and <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> are lost in the hospital context and trying to influence life and adapt to life circumstances, while being relentlessly dependent on care professionals. Care professionals work from both an organizational and a medical approach. Disharmony and disagreement seem to arise easily among the professionals regarding the planning negatively affecting the patients and <b>their</b> <b>relatives.</b> More efforts are needed in the DP to empower older people and <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> to go on with their life at home. The caring practice needs to more clearly meet and address the individual needs of older people and <b>their</b> <b>relatives</b> and <b>their</b> understanding of their illness. It needs to give them lifeworld and life goals to alleviate their suffering and to help them adjust to their new situation...|$|R

They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and <b>their</b> <b>relative</b> prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E
