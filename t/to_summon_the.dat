The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> demon Malroth to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs {{the king of the}} attack before he dies.

Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes his way across the Realms.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, {{but he managed to}} evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E
50|$|Basically, {{the accused}} {{will never see}} an {{information}}. An information is the detailed information related to the offence which the prosecutor lays before a magistrate and requests for a <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> be issued. Thus, all the accused should receive is a <b>summons</b> from <b>the</b> court. In order <b>to</b> ensure <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> is received by and served to the accused, the court is first <b>to</b> mail <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accused. If the accused does not appear and answer in the hearing required by the court, the court will assume the first service fails and will employ a police officer or court clerk <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand of the accused in person, following the guidance under Section 8(2) of the Magistrates Ordinance.|$|R
50|$|Itako are {{associated}} with the catalpa bow (azusa yumi), a plucked instrument with ties <b>to</b> <b>summoning</b> <b>the</b> dead. The necromantic ritual of plucked instruments is found in the earliest document of Japan's history, the Kojiki, which describes a koto's sound in conjunction with the possession of a medium and the channeling of the dead. Another poem describes the sound of the instrument as a reflection of his wife's spirit possessing the instrument. The biwa hoshi, itinerant blind priests, have a similar history with the instrument.|$|R

5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots {{were said to be}} easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} Luis Marín's {{reconnaissance}} expedition, Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when he crossed {{a part of}} the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with Hernán Cortés' expedition heading for Honduras. Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch'ol; he was unable to locate Cortés, and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan (modern Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango), in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch'ol. The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish-led expedition, and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses, including the killing of messengers sent <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown.

5|$|Hermione {{identifies}} in Dumbledore's book {{a strange}} symbol also worn {{at the wedding}} by Xenophilius Lovegood. They visit him and are told the symbol represents the mythical Deathly Hallows, three objects from an old fairy tale titled The Tale of the Three Brothers: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, able <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry realises Voldemort is seeking (and later successfully obtains) the Elder Wand, won by Dumbledore after Grindelwald's defeat, believing it {{will allow him to}} overpower the connection between his own wand and Harry's. Harry also recognises the Resurrection Stone as that found by Dumbledore which later become the second Hallow, and believes it to be hidden inside the Snitch Dumbledore left for him, but can't open it. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E

Along the way, they encounter several independent, mercenary, and pirate enemies in addition to Taiidan outposts. They also meet the Bentusi, a race of traders, who sell them advanced technology. After discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire, before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara. In gratitude for the Kushan's intervention, they promise <b>to</b> <b>summon</b> <b>the</b> Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's claim to Hiigara.|$|E

With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat.
