25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E

500|$|A Restoration {{novelty of}} which Wycherley took {{advantage}} was {{the readiness of}} public opinion to accept women on stage, {{for the first time}} in British history. Audiences were fascinated to see real women reverse the cross-dressing of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight-fitting male outfits in the popular breeches roles, and <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> match or even outdo the rake heroes in repartee and double entendre. Charles' choice of actresses as mistresses, notably Nell Gwyn, helped keep the interest fresh, and Wycherley plays on this interest in The Country Wife by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife (the eponymous 'country wife') in a boy's outfit. It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost voyeuristic way Margery's provocative innocence, as well as the immodest knowingness of [...] "town" [...] wives like Lady Fidget.|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up.

500|$|The {{starting}} {{title track}} of Crime Cutz derived its title {{from a person}} {{of the same name}} who gave Holy Ghost! a drum break {{to be used in the}} song; it was not included in the final mix, however. It begins with [...] "spacey" [...] synthesizers, before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song. Halfway into the song, diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in, which Frankel, [...] "literally found them on the internet. We met up the next day, and it was awesome and really moving <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> sing. In general we've tried to be a bit more off the cuff when recording recently, [...] a last minute addition while mixing the song." [...] Sequenced synth arpeggios, [...] "super-dry" [...] guitars, and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement. [...] "Stereotype" [...] is about the band's self-awareness and pride towards them being of a very well-known musical genre, singing in a mournful tone that [...] "I know I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical [...] Let go." [...] In the track's first draft, the drum parts and chord progression were developed first. Holy Ghost! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song, but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost! wanted it to be. It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April 1827, Abbott {{was made}} Baron Tenterden, of Hendon in the County of Middlesex; having feared that [...] "Lord Abbott" [...] would leave him open to ridicule, he instead picked {{the name of}} a Kentish town near his roots. On 24 May Abbott {{formally}} took up his position, attending the House of Lords regularly, and was the last Chief Justice to wear his official robes to the Lords (other than those acting as interim Speakers). In 1830 he introduced several bills to Parliament following reports {{on the state of the}} Ecclesiastical Courts, common law courts and law of real property; all were passed, except the ecclesiastical bills, as Parliament ran out of time <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> They were heard during the next Parliamentary session in 1831, and both passed; they [...] "by no means established for him the reputation of a skilful legislator... the judges have found it infinitely difficult to put a reasonable construction upon them". The Reform Act 1832 led to his departure from the Lords, and is considered to have greatly shortened his life; he fought strongly for the city corporations, which he claimed the bill treated [...] "with absolute contempt", but would be defeated. Having threatened that, should it pass, [...] "Never, never my Lords, shall I enter the doors of this House", he was true to his word, and never returned to politics, although from 8 August to 3 September 1827 he was interim Chancellor of the Exchequer, following the convention that, when vacant, the position should be held by the Lord Chief Justice.|$|E
500|$|Part of this {{creative}} experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions {{with varying}} sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, {{on a small}} number of staves with some indication of the orchestration. After an assistantAugust Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: [...] "I needed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them</b> in order {{to get an idea of}} them." [...] He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained [...] "works in progress" [...] as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves."

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>them.</b> St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E
