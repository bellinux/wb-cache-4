5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. <b>Their</b> <b>older</b> son Edmund J. Davis eventually was elected as governor there.|$|E

30|$|We model three {{different}} “return-to-work” scenarios (henceforth, we use “return-to-work” {{as a collective}} term for both “extension of working hours” and “take-up of work”): first, we assume a return-to-work period of two years, where individuals fall back to <b>their</b> <b>old</b> DI contracts after they receive the last payment tranche. (DI beneficiaries had the legal possibility to return to <b>their</b> <b>old</b> DI contracts when {{they were unable to}} work for 30 consecutive days within the first five years after reintegration.) Yet, {{at the time of the}} experiment, a lively political debate on future reforms of the Swiss DI system took place, particularly on how to enforce reintegration of current DI beneficiaries. DI recipients may thus have feared that they could not easily fall back into <b>their</b> <b>old</b> contract after two years. Therefore, the second scenario assumes that individuals increase employment for a period of five years and fall back to <b>their</b> <b>old</b> disability degree thereafter (but not into <b>their</b> <b>old</b> DI contract, see further explanations below). The third scenario assumes that individuals increase employment until retirement and do not fall back to <b>their</b> <b>old</b> disability degree.|$|R
5|$|During the tour, {{tensions}} sometimes arose {{between the}} senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended {{to abstain from}} alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had {{to the majority of}} the fielding as <b>their</b> <b>older</b> colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.|$|E
5|$|Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, {{were born}} in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents {{amicably}} divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and <b>their</b> <b>older</b> brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. During {{the course of his}} upbringing, Rex wanted to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father, a defensive pioneer in the NFL known for developing the 46 defense, and by the age of six, Rex and Rob knew they wanted to pursue coaching careers.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. <b>Their</b> <b>older</b> brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E

5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone crater. These boulders {{appeared to be}} layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of <b>their</b> <b>older</b> age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These boulders show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The {{funerals}} {{were held}} in Scotland with John and Joseph McCaig buried together in Ayr. <b>Their</b> <b>older</b> brother, serving with the Royal Marines in Singapore, was flown home for the service. That day, 20,000 people attended rallies in Belfast and Carrickfergus. In Belfast, the cenotaph at the City Hall {{was the focus of}} the mourning with 10,000 people attending including workers from factories in a gathering that stopped the traffic in the city centre. Many wept openly. The Reverend Ian Paisley led the mourners in laying dozens of wreaths. The crowd observed a two-minute silence and sang a hymn and the national anthem.|$|E

They will continue in their mother's company for {{one to two years}} before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with <b>their</b> <b>older</b> counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E

Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro. After assimilating this new culture, Moses becomes a {{shepherd}} and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by <b>their</b> <b>older</b> sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take <b>their</b> <b>older</b> two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with <b>their</b> <b>older</b> siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E
5|$|For preschoolers, {{there was}} the {{educational}} television show Barney & Friends starting in 1992; <b>their</b> <b>older</b> siblings had the 1988 animated movie The Land Before Time and its increasing line of direct to video sequels (13 by 2016). Dinosaurs, a television sitcom, parodied humans and other television shows. Of particular note is Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, Jurassic Park, the popularity of {{which led to a}} series of films and other media. The first of these, Jurassic Park, married advanced CGI with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs. Dinosaur was the most expensive movie in 2000, but was a box-office success. The falling cost of computer-generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television; the award-winning 1999 BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs, the 2001 When Dinosaurs Roamed America, the 2009 Animal Armageddon, and the 2011 Planet Dinosaur are notable examples.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{attended}} {{elementary and}} middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and a}} half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with <b>their</b> <b>older</b> sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E

Phil was teammates with {{his older brother}} Matt for two years at Missouri. , Matt is playing with the Plymouth Raiders in the British Basketball League. <b>Their</b> <b>older</b> sister Angie was an All-American volleyball player for the California Golden Bears. Pressey wore cornrows throughout his high school basketball career.

5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of <b>their</b> <b>older</b> brother George and Harry Vanda.|$|E
5|$|The {{motives of}} the nobility are {{somewhat}} clearer {{than those of}} the peasants; greed was apparently not a major factor. It is commonly assumed, for example by Runciman as mentioned above, that only younger members of a family went on crusade, looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere, as they had no prospects for advancement at home. Riley-Smith has shown that this was not always the case. The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense. For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the Duchy of Normandy to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church. According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence. Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and <b>their</b> <b>older</b> brother Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives. Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the Siege of Antioch, taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.|$|E
