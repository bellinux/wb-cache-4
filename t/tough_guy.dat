How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known, but back in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} season, Orr was {{challenged}} by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal <b>tough</b> <b>guy</b> Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees {{for the first time}} in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable <b>tough</b> <b>guy</b> who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E

25|$|With Head Coach Bill Barber's {{promotion}} to the Flyers after the 1999–2000 season {{as an assistant}} (and later head) coach, Assistant Coach John Stevens—who {{had been forced to}} retire as a player the previous season because of a serious eye injury—became the second head coach of the Phantoms in June 2000. Stevens, the team's first captain, was soon joined by two more former Flyer players, defenseman Kjell Samuelsson and winger Don Nachbaur, to complete the new staff. In November 2003, long-time NHL <b>tough</b> <b>guy</b> and former Flyer left wing Craig Berube signed with the Phantoms to finish his 18-year professional career back in Philadelphia as a player/assistant coach. At the end of that season, he retired as a player to become a full-time assistant coach for the 2004–05 campaign, replacing Nachbaur, who had since returned to the Western Hockey League (WHL) as head coach of the Tri-City Americans.|$|E
25|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} an average {{one for the}} Colts. The team began the season with two proven goaltenders in Peter Di Salvo and Michael Hutchinson. Joining these two goalies were a mixture of 2nd and 3rd year players such as Alex Hutchings, Stefan Della Rovere, Kyle Clifford, Dalton Prout, and Ryan Gottschalk {{as well as a}} group of rookies with plenty of promise. Included in this group were Darren Archibald, Michael Sgarbossa, Ryan O'Connor, Stephen Gaskin and Colin Behenna; all of which would prove to be {{valuable}} assests both this year and in the future. The Colts made a few trades throughout the season and before the deadline, sending away the likes of Mitch Lebar, Marcus Pepe, Cory McGillis, Colt Kennedy, and Brian Lashoff in exchange for <b>tough</b> <b>guy</b> Peter Stevens, and goal scorers Josh Brittain, and Taylor Carnevale. The Colts would finish a disappointing 5th in the Eastern Conference with a 30–33–3–2 record. In the playoffs the Colts lost in the first round, falling in five games to the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors. At the end of 2008–09 season the Colts traded goaltender Michael Hutchinson to the London Knights in exchange for four draft picks which would later be traded for proven players during the next season's championship run.|$|E
25|$|Result: The interviewers {{felt that}} Stephen Higgins {{was the most}} {{impressive}} candidate out of the remaining 3 in terms of entrepreneurship. However, his CV was filled with exaggerations, and he wasn't {{shown to be a}} trustworthy teammate due to his arrogance and his self-preserved agendas. Although he appeared as a <b>tough</b> <b>guy,</b> he didn't come across with a lot of self-esteem. Geraldine was thought to be the most likeable candidate who appeared with the most determination and a good capacity to learn and develop. The problems the interviewers found with Geraldine included her distracting profile in her CV which included spelling errors, and that she didn't seem capable enough to deliver results at the level Bill wanted due to her inexperience. Steve Rayner was described as a world-class salesman. Although he has exceptionally good skills selling face to face, it was argued about whether he could rise to a much more senior position in the field of sales. Steve couldn't prove this in his CV or in the interviews (particularly to David), but it was said that he did come across with the potential to do so. It was also said that hiring Steve would be a risk, because it was revealed that he had problems with alcohol and gambling addictions in his background.|$|E
