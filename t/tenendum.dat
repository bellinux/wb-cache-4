5000|$|In a deed, a {{habendum clause}} usually {{begins with the}} words [...] "to have and to hold". This phrase is the {{translation}} of the Latin [...] that historically commenced these clauses in deeds. Technically speaking, the [...] "to have" [...] (habendum) is separate from the [...] "to hold" [...] (<b>tenendum),</b> such that the <b>tenendum</b> clause is sometimes considered a separate concept. Historically, the habendum clause dealt with [...] "the quantity of interest or estate which the grantee was {{to have in the}} property granted", while the <b>tenendum</b> clause addressed [...] "the tenure upon or under which it was to be held". Put differently, the habendum deals with the relationship between the possessor and the land—how the land is to be had—while the <b>tenendum</b> deals with the relationship between the possessor and his immediately superior lord—how the land is to be held. The obsolescence of land tenure, however, renders this distinction mostly historical and academic.|$|E

5000|$|Examples of de fide <b>tenenda</b> teachings {{taught by}} {{extraordinary}} definition include the canonizations of saints and Pope Leo XIII's declaration of Anglican orders as {{null and void}} (so-called [...] "dogmatic facts"). Neither of these could advance to de fide credenda status as they are contingent on historical facts. However, certain teachings on grace and justification from the Council of Trent, currently regarded as infallible but only de fide <b>tenenda</b> due to disagreement about whether they are explicitly contained in the deposit of faith or merely logically implied, could someday advance to de fide credenda status either through extraordinary definition or through the consensus of the universal magisterium.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{extraordinary}} {{definitions and}} the universal magisterium may teach de fide credenda or de fide <b>tenenda</b> teachings. An example of de fide credenda teachings taught by extraordinary definition are the Christological {{teachings of the}} early ecumenical councils or the Marian dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and Assumption taught by the popes.|$|R

5000|$|Infallible teachings can {{be divided}} into two {{categories}} of precedence. The highest are called de fide credenda teachings, that is to say teachings defined as explicitly and specifically revealed in the deposit of faith: [...] "Wherefore, by divine and Catholic faith all those things are to be believed which are contained in the word of God as found in Scripture and Tradition, and which are proposed by the Church as matters to be believed as divinely revealed, whether by her solemn judgment or in her ordinary and universal Magisterium." [...] (First Vatican Council, Dei Filius 8.) The other category are called de fide <b>tenenda</b> teachings. These are equally infallible but are proposed not as being explicitly in the deposit of faith, but nevertheless implied by it or intrinsically connected to it logically or historically. These too demand supernatural faith, but not specifically in themselves on the authority of the Word of God. Further discernment may lead to the conclusion that a de fide <b>tenenda</b> teaching is not merely implied by the deposit of faith, but explicitly contained and thus it may advance to de fide credenda status.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many baronies by tenure were {{converted}} into baronies by writ. The rest {{ceased to exist}} as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in free socage, {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents. Thus baronies could no longer be held by military service. Parliamentary titles of honour had been limited since the 15th century by the Modus <b>Tenenda</b> Parliamenta act, and could thenceforth only be created by writ of summons or letters patent.|$|R
5000|$|An {{opinion from}} {{a former member of}} the Congregation For the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger holds Examples of de fide <b>tenenda</b> teachings taught by infallible {{ordinary}} and universal magisterium include the validity of papal elections, earlier non-papal canonizations now universally accepted (of St. Agnes, for example), or the immorality of pornography. However, none of these could advance to de fide credenda status as they are contingent on historical facts or developments, as for example pornography is condemned, and infallibly so, but is likely not included specifically in the deposit of faith (there was no such concept at the time), but is nevertheless an infallibly discerned implication of the more general revealed teachings on human sexuality and chastity. However, certain teachings taught in such a manner may someday advance to de fide credenda status, either through extraordinary definition or the consensus of the ordinary universal magisterium. As, for example, the teaching on papal infallibility was infallibly taught for a long time de fide <b>tenenda</b> by the universal magisterium, but not de fide credenda until the extraordinary definition at Vatican I, because there was disagreement on whether it was a specifically revealed truth from the deposit of faith or merely the logical implication of other things in the deposit of faith (as, for example, the authority of Saint Peter in the college of apostles, the constitution of the Church, her unity, her episcopal structure, etc.) ...|$|R

Following the {{assumption}} of the Savigniac order into the Cistercian order in 1147 Neath Abbey also became a Cistercian house. To it he donated many of his lands, both in Wales and in Devon which he held from the Honour of Gloucester, including Littleham, near Bideford in North Devon. A later confirmation charter granted in 1207 by King John (1199-1216) to Neath Abbey confirmed to the monks the former grants of Richard de Grenville:Johannes Deo Gratia etc. Sciatis nos dedisse et concessisse et presenti carta nostra confirmasse Deo et ecclesie sancte Trinitatis de Neth et monachis ibidem Deo servientibus locum ubi castellum Ricardi de Granavilla quondam fuit cum omnibus pertinentiis suis et totam terram quam idem Ricardus habuit inter Thawy et Neth, in bosco et plano cum omnibus partinentiis suis; habenda et <b>tenenda</b> in liberam puram et perpetuara elemosinam, quieta ab omni servicio sicut predictus Ricardus ea illis prius dedit et carta sua confirmavit.

60|$|The {{granting}} of this jurisdiction to the Pope gave several Bishops occasion {{to write to}} him for his resolutions upon doubtful cases, whereupon he answered by decretal Epistles; and henceforward he gave laws to the Western Churches by such Epistles. Himerius Bishop of Tarraco, the head city of a province in Spain, writing to Pope Damasus for his direction about certain Ecclesiastical matters, and the Letter not arriving at Rome till {{after the death of}} Damasus, A.C. 384; his successor Siricius answered the same with a legislative authority, telling him of one thing: Cum hoc fieri--missa ad Provincias à venerandæ memoriæ prædecessore meo Liberio generalia decreta, prohibeant. Of another: Noverint se ab omni ecclesiastico honore, quo indignè usi sunt, Apostolicæ Sedis auctoritate, dejectos. Of another: Scituri posthac omnium Provinciarum summi Antistites, quod si ultrò ad sacros ordines quenquam de talibus esse assumendum, & de suo & de aliorum statu, quos contra Canones & interdicta nostra provexerint, congruam ab Apostolica Sede promendam esse sententiam. And the Epistle he concludes thus: Explicuimus, ut arbitror, frater charissime, universa quæ digesta sunt in querelam; & ad singulas causas, de quibus ad Romanam Ecclesiam, utpote ad caput tui corporis, retulisti; sufficientia, quantum opinor, responsa reddidimus. Nunc fraternitatis tuæ animum ad servandos canones, & <b>tenenda</b> decretalia constituta, magis ac magis incitamus: ad hæc quæ ad tua consulta rescripsimus in omnium Coepiscoporum perferri facias notionem; & non solum corum, qui in tua sunt dioecesi constituti, sed etiam ad universos Carthaginenses ac Boeticos, Lusitanos atque [2] Gallicos, vel eos qui vicinis tibi collimitant hinc inde Provinciis, hæc quæ a nobis sunt salubri ordinatione disposita, sub literarum tuarum prosecutione mittantur. Et quanquam statuta sedis Apostolicæ vel Canonum venerabilia definita, nulli Sacerdotum Domini ignorare sit liberum: utilius tamen, atque pro antiquitate sacerdotii tui, dilectioni tuæ esse admodùm poterit gloriosum, si ea quæ ad te speciali nomine generaliter scripta sunt, per unanimitatis tuæ sollicitudinem in universorum fratrum nostrorum notitiam perferantur; quatenus & quæ à nobis non inconsultè sed providè sub nimia cautela & deliberatione sunt salubriter constituta, intemerata permaneant, & omnibus in posterum excusationibus aditus, qui jam nulli apud nos patere poterit, obstruatur. Dat. 3 Id. Febr. Arcadio & Bautone viris clarissimis Consulibus, A.C. 385. Pope Liberius in the reign of Jovian or Valentinian I. sent general Decrees to the Provinces, ordering that the Arians should not be rebaptized: and this he did in favour of the Council of Alexandria, that nothing more should be required of them than to renounce their opinions. Pope Damasus is said to have decreed in a Roman Council, that Tithes and Tenths should be paid upon pain of an Anathema; and that Glory be to the Father, &c. should be said or sung {{at the end of the}} Psalms. But the first decretal Epistle now extant is this of Siricius to Himerius; by which the Pope made Himerius his Vicar over all Spain for promulging his Decrees, and seeing them observed. The Bishop of Sevill was also the Pope's Vicar sometimes; for Simplicius wrote thus to Zeno Bishop of that place: Talibus idcirco gloriantes indiciis, congruum duximus vicariâ Sedis nostræ te auctoritate fulciri: cujus vigore munitus, Apostolicæ institutionis Decreta, vel sanctorum terminos Patrum, nullatenus transcendi permittas. And Pope Hormisda [3] made the Bishop of Sevill his Vicar over Boetica and Lusitania, and the Bishop of Tarraco his Vicar over all the rest of Spain, as appears by his Epistles to them.|$|R
