5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> {{became an}} object of a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> In 1661, Lannion ordered <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> and then tied around their waist, or {{half of the}} band would be tied to <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin in front of <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> {{were said to be}} similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, {{images of}} <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> were heavily {{used in both}} {{recruitment}} posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>statues</b> at Amenhotep III temple wasn't a {{good place}} for them {{topography}} wise because they were put in an area that suffered from rising ground water and would destroy <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> For that reason <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> were moved to other sites like the temple of Mut. Sekhmet <b>statues</b> found at <b>the</b> temple of Mut on the east bank at Luxor were the same ones used in Amenhotep III courts. The Sekhmet goddess and goddess Mut are linked together. Mut is the wife of Amun and was worshipped at the Mut Precinct. <b>The</b> Sekhmet <b>statues</b> had begun to be moved to the temple of Mut by the 19th dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> were identified together and give religious influence. <b>The</b> two <b>statues</b> religious influence were meant to balance each other with fierce and gentle attributes and avoid destruction. The British Museum has the largest collection of Sekhmet statues outside of Egypt. Many of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> can still be found at their original sites. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> were positioned near the sacred lake in the temple of Mut. Other areas where rituals that involve Sekhmet are by similar kidney shaped lakes. Many felt <b>the</b> number of <b>statues</b> found is unusual, but when looking at the evidence they were used as a calendar and for sed festivals. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> were used in rituals to please <b>the</b> goddess. Sekhmet <b>statues</b> at Mut at Karnak on the east bank at Luxor were from Amenhotep III courts. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> can be traced back through the epithets found on <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following the monument's {{relocation}} in the 1990s, several {{incidents of}} vandalism were {{reported on the}} site, including littering with empty alcohol bottles and hypodermic needles, amethysts being pried off <b>the</b> <b>statue's</b> base, damage to the onsite washrooms, one of <b>the</b> <b>statue's</b> hands being sawed off, and an aborted partial attempt to saw off <b>the</b> <b>statue's</b> head.|$|R

5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was erected through purely private initiative, {{with the support of}} national government of Argentina, the municipal council of Buenos Aires and a public funding campaign. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; it is well known to locals.

5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> is of an ancient king; in a photograph of <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>statues</b> are {{composed}} of cast masonry, and were all originally located in one plaza, in front of J.P. Licks and a Store 24, but in 1996, the Somerville Arts Council, {{in conjunction with the}} city, chose to move <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> to their current locations all across Davis Square, in front of subway stations, and in other small parks nearby. Also in 1996 bronze [...] "masks" [...] were added to <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> Steven Post states, “the statues were meant to be ‘temporary’ in that they were not made of bronze. Vandals destroyed some of the faces of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> over <b>the</b> years, so the artist and the city decided to replace the faces with the bronze ‘mask’ that <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> all now ‘wear’.” ...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>statues</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the temple of Mut and the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III. Many excavators have documented their finds. From excavations, Egyptologists have come across both completed, destroyed and fragments of <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> In 1915 <b>the</b> Met Museum received a Sekhmet statue as a gift of Henry Walters and that particular statue {{can be traced to}} the Amenhotep III mortuary temple. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> at <b>the</b> Met Museum were found at the latter site of Amenhotep III. At the temple of Amenhotep III <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> were set in lavish fashion in double rows, one behind <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> looked as if they were ready for battle. Sekhmet statues at Kom el Heittan {{can be found}} at the courts aligned with other divine <b>statues.</b> <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> would form a celestial map that would be the kings eternal ritual calendar. This would explain why there were so many statues built.|$|R
5|$|Battersea council {{agreed to}} provide space for <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> on its Latchmere Recreation Ground, part of the council's new Latchmere Estate, which offered terraced homes to rent for seven and sixpence a week. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was {{unveiled}} on 15 September 1906 {{in front of a}} large crowd, with speakers that included George Bernard Shaw and the Irish feminist Charlotte Despard.|$|E
5|$|Captain Edward Smith – Unveiled in July 1914 at {{the western}} end of the Museum Gardens, <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, wife of Antarctic {{explorer}} Robert Scott. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite and the figure is bronze. This is a memorial to the captain of the RMS Titanic, which sank on 15 April 1912. Captain Smith was from Hanley and Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> originally cost £740 raised through local and national contributions. In 2010, as part of the 'Parks for People' programme, <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was restored and the green patina removed from its surface at a cost of £16,000.

5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within <b>the</b> <b>statue,</b> temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was closed to the public from May until December 1938.|$|E
