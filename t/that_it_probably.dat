5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing of the house. In 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the investigative team believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In {{the case of the}} older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin and}} age of the figure are unclear. It is often thought of as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} American mink, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|N. J. Higham {{has argued}} that because {{the date of the}} {{original}} information is unknown and the largest Northumbrian kingdoms are not included in the Tribal Hidage, it cannot be proved to be a tribute list of Mercian origin. He notes that Elmet, which was never a province of Mercia, is included in the list. He suggests that the Tribal Hidage may have been a tribute list drawn up by Edwin of Northumbria in the 620s, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> originated before 685, after which no Northumbrian king exercised imperium over the Southumbrian kingdoms. According to Higham, the values assigned to each people are likely to be specific to the events of 625-626, representing the individual contracts made between Edwin and those who recognised his overlordship at that time. This explains the artificial and rounded nature of the figures that were arrived at: the figure of 100,000 hides for the West Saxons was probably the largest number Edwin knew. However, D. P. Kirby notes that the Northumbrian origin theory has not been generally accepted as convincing.|$|E

5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

25|$|A popular but {{unconfirmed}} theory {{claims that}} Malbec {{is named after}} a Hungarian peasant who first spread the grape variety throughout France. However the French ampelographer and viticulturalist Pierre Galet notes that most evidence suggest that Côt was the variety's original name and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> originated in northern Burgundy. Despite a similar name, the grape Malbec argenté is not Malbec, but rather a variety of the southwestern French grape Abouriou. Due to the similarities in synonyms, Malbec has also been confused with Auxerrois blanc, which is an entirely different variety.|$|E
25|$|The {{provenance}} of the Scansoriopteryx {{type specimen}} is uncertain, {{as it was}} obtained from private fossil dealers who did not record exact geologic data. Czerkas and Yuan initially reported that it had likely come from the Yixian Formation, though Wang et al. (2006), {{in their study of}} the age of the Daohugou Beds, suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> hails from the same beds, and thus is likely a synonym of Epidendrosaurus. The Daohugou Beds supposedly date to the mid-late Jurassic Period., but this is hotly contested. See the Daohugou Beds article for details.|$|E

25|$|Indications are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> {{had large}} {{seasonal}} changes in discharge, evident by cross-bedded sandstones deposited at stages of lower flow, although whilst the flow was seasonal, {{it is perhaps}} doubtful if this system was ephemeral in nature for there is relatively little evidence of any large-scale aeolian sandstones in the basinal settings of the Midlands. It is clear that more locally sourced material such as carboniferous limestone and reworked earlier Triassic sandstone from the Clent Formation just south of Birmingham were also important components of the river systems as they flowed northwards giving some indication of the relief of the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|NELL2 is a tissue-specific {{protein in}} the nervous system. It {{contains}} EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeat domain and its gene expression is regulated by estrogen. NELL2 {{is also known}} to play a neuroprotective role rat hippocampus neurons. When NELL2 synthesis is blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of antisense (AS) NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into neonatal male rat brains (postnatal day0-day5), the size of SDN-POA is decreased. Since volume of SDN {{is related to the}} level of testosterone, {{it is quite possible that}} the volume is finally due to the neuroprotective effect of estradiol which is produced from testosterone by aromatase. So the result that NELL2 blockage reduces the size of SDN-POA suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> has neuroprotective effect on SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosive}} mechanism was a gas-enhanced device {{consisting of}} compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) {{to create a}} fuel-air explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> would have brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|E

25|$|Through Origen and {{especially}} the scholarly presbyter Pamphilus of Caesarea, an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time, containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: Gregory Nazianzus, Basil the Great, Jerome and others came to study there. The Caesarean text-type is recognized by scholars {{as one of the}} earliest New Testament types. The collections of the library suffered during the persecutions under the Emperor Diocletian, but were repaired subsequently by bishops of Caesarea. It was noted in the 6th century, but Henry Barclay Swete was of the opinion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> did not long survive the capture of Caesarea in 640, though a modern historian might attribute more destruction to its previous capture by the Sassanids (in 614).|$|E
25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>probably</b> started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
