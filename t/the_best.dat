40|$|Background and Purpose. Currently, no {{functional}} balance measures {{provide information}} regarding the different components of balance, to assist the clinician {{in the direction of}} their physical therapy intervention. <b>The</b> <b>BESTest</b> was designed to provide clinicians with such information. <b>The</b> <b>BESTest</b> consists of five categories testing different components of balance: 1) stability limits/verticality, 2) transitions/anticipatory, 3) reactive, 4) sensory orientation, 5) stability and gait. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the inter rater reliability of <b>the</b> <b>BESTest.</b> Subjects. <b>The</b> subjects were eleven adult community members, including five with vestibular loss, three with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and three healthy control subjects. Their ages ranged from 50 - 80 years old. Raters: Six physical therapists, with four to nineteen years of experience and three physical therapy students participated in the study as 2 ̆ 2 scoring therapists. 2 ̆ 2 Methods: The scoring therapists were asked to concurrently score the performance of 11 subjects on the items of <b>the</b> <b>BESTest.</b> Results. <b>The</b> <b>BESTest</b> overall demonstrated good inter-rater reliability (ICC =. 90). Inter-rater reliability varied among the five sections, with Section five (ICC=. 54) demonstrating the lowest and Section three (ICC=. 93) the highest. Discussion and Conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>BESTest</b> has demonstrated appropriate reliability for a clinical functional tool. Further studies examining intra-rater reliability and validity are necessary...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) was {{recently}} created {{to allow the}} development of treatments according to the specific balance system affected in each patient. The Brazilian version of <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> has not been specifically tested after stroke. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intra- and inter-rater reliability and concurrent and convergent validity of the total score of <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> and BESTest sections for adults with hemiparesis after stroke. METHOD: The study included 16 subjects (61. 1 &# 177; 7. 5 years) with chronic hemiparesis (54. 5 &# 177; 43. 5 months after stroke). <b>The</b> <b>BESTest</b> was administered by two raters in the same week {{and one of the}} raters repeated the test after a one-week interval. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess intra- and interrater reliability. Concurrent validity with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and convergent validity with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-Brazil) were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Both <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> total score (ICC= 0. 98) and <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> sections (ICC between 0. 85 and 0. 96) have excellent intrarater reliability. Interrater reliability for the total score was excellent (ICC= 0. 93) and, for the sections, it ranged between 0. 71 and 0. 94. The correlation coefficient between <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> and <b>the</b> BBS and ABC-Brazil were 0. 78 and 0. 59, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Brazilian version of <b>the</b> <b>BESTest</b> demonstrated adequate reliability when measured by sections and could identify what balance system was affected in patients after stroke. Concurrent validity was excellent with the BBS total score and good to excellent with the sections. The total scores but not the sections present adequate convergent validity with the ABC-Brazil. However, other psychometric properties should be further investigated...|$|R
