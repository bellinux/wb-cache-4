5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed.

5|$|Some of the {{architectural}} features incorporated throughout the castle included: corbelled battlemented wallheads on the towers; turrets set above {{first or second}} storey level; a large elongated aperture provided light in the first floor hall; and shot holes in the southwest tower. The fenestrations on the wing added in the late 18th century differed from <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> earlier parts of the structure, being larger and more regular in appearance.|$|E

Testing methods applied to the codex included ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography, optical microscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The specific aim of this non-destructive testing was to compare the materials used in the codex with <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> other pre-Columbian codices.|$|E

5|$|Wheel of Fortune (often known {{simply as}} Wheel) is an American {{television}} game show created by Merv Griffin.

5|$|ASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and {{a number}} of closely related sign {{languages}} derived from ASL are used in many different countries. Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in these imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects. On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language. For some imported ASL varieties, such as <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.|$|E

5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their firepower. As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon are similar to <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had {{the distinction of being}} the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.|$|E

In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were fired at the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
5|$|Skis used in {{cross-country}} are {{lighter and}} narrower than <b>those</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> alpine skiing. Ski bottoms {{are designed to}} provide a gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E
