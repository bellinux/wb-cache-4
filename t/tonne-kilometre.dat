5000|$|Saskatchewan {{covers a}} vast area, with the {{majority}} of the south central grasslands supporting an agricultural economy. The province sustains only 2% of Canada's population, and 20% of Canada's roads. Challenges are presented to support increased demands on the road infrastructure. Over 4,000 km of rail lines are not being used (and this number is rising), with this mode of transportation replaced by vehicular traffic. As well Saskatchewan's economy is diversifying into the oil and gas sector, and mining which also is increasing truck traffic. Roads are becoming secondary highways to provide means for the agricultural farmer or the industry trucker to find a route to a city market or consolidated elevator. [...] The quantity of smaller wood grain elevators has declined in favour of concrete inland grain terminals. Grain hauling by truck by <b>tonne-kilometre</b> has increased 17 times over the level of the 1970s. Thin membrane surface TMS roads handle vehicle and light traffic routes. Gravel highways suffice if the average annual daily traffic (AADT) is below 150 vehicles a day. Saskatchewan classifies road system depending on amount of use or road function and can be further designated as major arterial, minor arterial, collector and local.|$|E
30|$|The {{total number}} of {{allowances}} allocated to each aircraft operator {{will be determined by}} a benchmark which is calculated in three consecutive steps: First, the share of auctioned allowances is subtracted from the overall “cap”. Second, the remaining CO 2 -emissions will be divided by the sum of verified <b>tonne-kilometre</b> data for flights falling under the geographical scope of the EU-ETS in the monitoring year 2010, as reported by all participating aircraft operators. Third, the specific amount of allowances each operator receives is calculated by multiplying the respective individual <b>tonne-kilometre</b> value of the monitoring year with the benchmark. Each operator’s revenue tonne-kilometres are calculated by multiplying the mission distance (great-circle-distance plus an additional fixed surcharge of 95  km) by the payload transported (cargo, mail and passengers). For the calculation of the performed tonne-kilometres, each passenger including baggage is assigned a value of 100  kg.|$|E

Eurostat data report that freight transport in Sweden (by rail, road and waterways) increased by 17  % in <b>tonne-kilometre</b> terms between 2000 and 2008. Passenger transport increased little over the same period. This puts the increase in total greenhouse gas emissions into perspective.

30|$|As the EU-ETS will be {{introduced}} in 2012, forecast flight schedules were produced based on the latest available scheduled data. Given the current economic situation, no traffic growth was assumed between 2008 and 2010. For the years 2010 – 2012, on the other hand, regional growth factors derived from common manufacturers’ forecasts were applied to the base year flight schedules {{in order to produce}} a forecast up to the year 2012. The introduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft, potential improvements in the field of Air Traffic Management and a further increase in terms of load factors were considered by assuming a 1 % efficiency improvement per year resulting in a corresponding reduction of fuel-consumption and emissions per <b>tonne-kilometre.</b> This way, a reliable and best possible estimation of traffic volumes and CO 2 -emissions of European flight operations up to the year 2012 could be performed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the factors that}} have influenced the energy intensity of the Spanish road freight transport of heavy goods vehicles over the period 1996 – 2012. This article aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the factors behind the energy intensity change of road freight and also to inform the design of measures to improve energy efficiency in road freight transport. The paper uses both annual single-period and chained multi-period multiplicative LMDI-II decomposition analysis. The results suggest that the decrease in the energy intensity of Spanish road freight in the period is explained by the change in the real energy intensity index (lower energy consumption per <b>tonne-kilometre</b> transported), which is partially offset by the behaviour of the structural index (greater share in freight transport of those commodities the transportation of which is more energy intensive). The change in energy intensity is analysed in more depth by quantifying the contribution of each commodity through the attribution of changes in Divisia indices...|$|E
30|$|Road freight {{transport}} has negative environmental impacts such as energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and pollution emissions. For this reason, new indicators {{relate to the}} wider impacts of transport operations on the environment are defined: fuel and energy consumption, expressed in liters or {{tonnes of oil equivalent}} (toe), and CO 2 emissions, expressed in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (tCO 2 e). Table 1 shows the equivalences used for the calculation of these indicators from the running kilometers. These equivalences make possible to estimate the environmental impacts of transport using fuel and emission efficiency indicators [29]. Given that the PRFSS has no data on energy consumption, fuel consumption average values of 0.25 to 0.35 (liters per kilometer, depending of vehicle size) were considered assuming that road transport operations monitored in other European studies [26, 29, 30] are representative of the general movement of goods by road in Spain. The transport energy performance indicator, defined as fuel efficiency, has been converted to emission efficiency with the main unit gram CO 2 emitted per <b>tonne-kilometre</b> (gr CO 2 /tkm).|$|E

40|$|Freight is an {{important}} source of CO 2 emissions. In France, there is a will to reduce transports emissions (Grenelle of Environment). The objective of this research is to quantify the freight CO 2 emissions by sectors of activity and to assess the influence of logistical practices on freight transport energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. For this research, we utilize the French 2004 shipper survey. This latter describes the characteristics of 3000 shippers, of 10000 shipments, and of 20000 different legs of the transport chains. Using this survey, we computed the energy consumption of each consignment, leg by leg and then summed it on the transport chain. This energy or CO 2, when related to the tonne-kilometres gives the unitary consumption, in grams of oil equivalent per <b>tonne-kilometre</b> (goe/tkm) or unitary emission of the shipment. This data give us some results by type of activity and by mode. We will try to identify Activity types with similar levels of emissions of CO 2.

40|$|What are the {{characteristics}} of freight transport which {{have an impact on}} CO 2 emissions? Among those characteristics, what is the importance of the shipper’s logistical choices on CO 2 emissions? To answer this question we use the 2004 French shipper survey. This survey describes {{the characteristics}} of 3 000 shippers, of 10 000 shipments, and of 20 000 different legs of the transport chains. We computed the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of each shipment, leg by leg and then summed it on the transport chain, per shipment. This CO 2 emission, when related to the tonne-kilometres, gives the carbon intensity of the shipment, in grams of CO 2 per <b>tonne-kilometre.</b> We find that there is a very high variability of carbon intensity per shipment: from less than 0. 01 to more than 100 kgCO 2 /tkm. We then analyse this carbon intensity per shipment according to two types of shipment characteristics: the shippers ’ logistical choices (shipment frequency and mode choice) on the one hand and, on the other hand, transport demand characteristics independent of the logistical choices (distance as the crow fly and yearly tonnage shipped to the same client). Using a log log model, where carbon intensity is a function of these characteristics, we fin...|$|E
40|$|Freight {{transport}} {{is closely}} linked to industrial and commercial activities and {{can be seen as}} a fully integrated element of the production process. Shipper production and logistic constraints play an important role in the choice of transport solutions. However, there is little statistical data on which to base an analysis of the relationship between transport and its production and logistics related determinants. For this reason two large national surveys were undertaken in France to provide us with new empirical data. The paper presents the methodological aspects of these surveys (the 1988 Shipper Survey and the 2004 ECHO Survey). The use of 'the shipment' as the measurement unit instead of the usual tonne or <b>tonne-kilometre</b> approach is one of the major innovations of these surveys which provide a new statistical insight. Another particularity is the tracking of the shipment and the identification of each transport leg and operator involved in the shipment. The whole transport chain is described, from both the physical and organizational standpoint. A selection of results, indicators and trends, is presented with a focus on the main changes that have occurred in recent years based on a comparison between the two datasets. Special attention is paid to the relationship between transport choices and the production characteristics of sites and the increasing spatial and temporal fragmentation of shipments which makes the choice of modes other than the road increasingly difficult...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The Swedish {{government}} {{is likely to}} implement longer and heavier road freight vehicles, so-called high-capacity vehicles (HCVs), in the near future. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analysis the expected effects on the whole transport system regarding tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres on road, CO 2 and socio-economics with three possible implementation strategies (HCVs on all roads, a designated road network and a designated road network with a kilometre-based truck charge) and two vehicle types (74 t/ 25. 25 m and 74 t/ 34 m). Design/methodology/approach: Calculations are based on two well-established scenarios for transport development in Sweden. Changes per <b>tonne-kilometre</b> are modelled for ten product groups with considerations taken to their transport networks. Socio-economic effects are analysed using the net present value rating method over a 40 -year period. Findings: The study shows the increase in demand for transport and the modal shift, from rail and sea to road, in terms of tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres and CO 2 emissions for three implementation strategies of HCVs in two scenarios. All implementation strategies show a positive social net-benefit with the introduction of HCVs. Research limitations/implications: The results reveal potential benefits to the implementation of HCVs. The results are limited by possible over/under-estimations of effects considered in the calculations, due to uncertainties and assumptions. Practical implications: The results highlight expected levels of modal shift and induced transport for different HCV implementation strategies and how they depend on transport and climate policies and the expected growth of tonne-kilometres. Originality/value: The calculations consider socio-economic effects, particularly from increased CO 2 emissions due to modal shift and induced traffic, which is lacking in previous studies. To balance conflicting economic and environmental goals, the findings indicate that the implementation of HCVs could be accompanied by other policy measures. The findings are based on the Swedish context, but the model can be adapted to other countries or regions and to study other freight transport reforms...|$|E
