5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes {{for a handful of}} bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E

25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers {{from the top of the}} coil.|$|E
25|$|Brochs' close groupings and profusion in {{many areas}} may indeed suggest {{that they had a}} {{primarily}} defensive or even offensive function. Some of them were sited beside precipitous cliffs and were protected by large ramparts, artificial or natural: a good example is at Burland near Gulberwick in Shetland, on a clifftop and cut off from the mainland by huge ditches. Often they are at key strategic points. In Shetland they sometimes cluster on each side of narrow stretches of water: the broch of Mousa, for instance, is directly opposite another at Burraland in Sandwick. In Orkney <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen on the facing shores of Eynhallow Sound, and many at the exits and entrances of the great harbour of Scapa Flow. In Sutherland quite a few are placed along the sides and at the mouths of deep valleys. Writing in 1956 John Stewart suggested that brochs were forts put up by a military society to scan and protect the countryside and seas.|$|E

25|$|Pollen {{analyses}} {{show that}} the dry geest soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the Pleistocene sandy soils quickly led however to soil degradation. So the land cleared by fire could only {{be used for a}} short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. Even at that time the first Calluna (heather) heaths appeared (see above). Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in Uelzen district. On Lüneburg Heath there are numerous Megalithic sites and tumuli from the Neolithic and the early Bronze Age. The most famous are the Oldendorfer Totenstatt (Oldendorf Gravesite) and the Sieben Steinhäuser (Seven Stone Houses). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince's Grave (Fürstengrab). Also near Wilsede there is the well-known stone and juniper group known as Hannibal's Grave (Hannibals Grab).|$|E

The western painted and the ornate box turtle are turtle species known to exist and about eight species of lizards such as the greater short-horned lizard have been documented. Amphibians such as the Columbia spotted frog and the boreal toad are considered species of concern because of their high susceptibility to disease, habitat loss and human introduced toxins. Boreal toads are found at elevations of between [...] and the Columbia spotted frog can live at elevations as high as [...] in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.|$|E
500|$|Another {{hundred or}} so known objects in the Solar System are {{suspected}} to be dwarf planets. Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets will be identified when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored, and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered. Individual astronomers recognize several of these, and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects, ranging from [...] "nearly certain" [...] to [...] "possible" [...] dwarf planets.' Brown currently identifies ten known trans-Neptunian objects—the four accepted by the IAU plus , , , , [...] and —as [...] "virtually certain", with another twenty highly likely.

In 1969, folk {{songwriter}} and singer John Stewart recorded [...] "Armstrong", a tribute to Armstrong and his first steps on the Moon. Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor; the building cost $53.2million and was dedicated on October 27, 2007, during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts. In 1971, Armstrong was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point for his service to the country. The Armstrong Air and Space Museum, in Armstong's hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio, and the airport in New Knoxville, where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen, were named after him.|$|E
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly {{with that of the}} original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett, a {{reviewer}} from IGN, praised {{both the}} {{writing and the}} acting of season 4.

[...] Aubry D'Arminio praised the season, but she also showed disapproval at what she felt was a lack of use for some of The Offices supporting cast in the episodes directly following the Writers' Strike, saying [...] "I just feel a bit sad that, minus Leslie David Baker's Stanley, these excellent actors/characters haven't been highlighted nearly enough since the series' return in April." [...] In a comprehensive review of the fourth season DVD, IGN reviewers Travis Fickett and Phil Pirrello both believed [...] "this season {{to be one of the}} show's best, [...] that 14 episodes across four discs gives way to crowding, especially when the season tries to tackle Jim and Pam dating, Angela and Dwight breaking up, Andy and Angela dating by way of awkward silence, Michael and Jan breaking up, Toby leaving the office and a new love interest for Michael joining the cast." [...] Fickett and Pirrello gave the season a total score of 8 out of 10.|$|E
