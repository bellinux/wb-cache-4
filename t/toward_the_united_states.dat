5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{began as a}} subtropical cyclone over the central Atlantic and became a hurricane while moving westward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Lili did not gain any additional strength before curving away from land and weakening into a tropical storm. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane's effects on land were minimal, despite multiple tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Initial uncertainty in its track prompted some concern of a landfall in North Carolina, but it remained predominately over the open ocean.|$|E

5|$|The Perfect Storm {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years.

25|$|Albanian-Chinese {{relations}} had stagnated by 1970, {{and when}} the Asian giant began to reemerge from isolation and the Cultural Revolution in the early 1970s, Mao and the other Communist Chinese leaders reassessed their commitment to tiny Albania. In response, Albania began broadening its contacts with the outside world. Albania opened trade negotiations with France, Italy, and the recently independent Asian and African states, and in 1971 it normalised relations with Yugoslavia and Greece. Albania's leaders abhorred the People's Republic of China's contacts with the United States in the early 1970s, and its press and radio ignored President Richard Nixon's trip to Beijing in 1972. Albania actively worked to reduce its dependence on Communist China by diversifying trade and by improving diplomatic and cultural relations, especially with Western Europe. But Albania shunned the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and was the only European country that refused {{to take part in}} the Helsinki Conference of July 1975.

500|$|A low {{pressure}} system {{moving through the}} Mid-Atlantic states pulled Carrie northwest, back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> East Coast, at an accelerated forward speed. Later on September 2, the storm had begun {{to show signs of}} reorganization, including an improved appearance on satellite imagery and the development of some thunderstorm activity, although significant reintensification was considered unlikely. However, with the advance of a trough embedded in the westerlies, Carrie quickly deepened under the influence of baroclinic processes. While the storm's maximum sustained winds increased, it also began to shed its tropical characteristics and resemble an extratropical cyclone. Moving once again toward the north-northeast, Carrie was declared extratropical by the National Hurricane Center during the late afternoon on September 2. In the official Atlantic Hurricane Database, however, Carrie is listed as a tropical cyclone until 1800 UTC on September 3, at which point it possessed winds of [...] and a central barometric pressure of [...] As a result, these data are considered representative of the storm's peak intensity.
