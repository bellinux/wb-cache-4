5|$|Prior to the 2008 season, it was {{reported}} by numerous news sources that <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> thinking of including Hughes in a trade to the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana. The trade never happened; Santana {{was traded to the}} New York Mets instead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> on the road.|$|E

5|$|Hughes first {{committed}} to Santa Clara University, but {{he chose to}} sign with the New York Yankees when they selected {{him in the first}} round, with the 23rd overall selection, of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> awarded this pick as compensation when free agent pitcher Andy Pettitte signed with the Houston Astros.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{spent part}} of the offseason of 1925–26 working out at Artie McGovern's gym, where he got back into shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and {{surrounded}} the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> not expected to win the pennant.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Yankees {{held the}} AL East lead {{entering}} August, but faded and ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before {{the building was}} renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, and <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> required {{to play at the}} Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.|$|E

5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to be split into two halves. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> given a berth in an {{expanded}} playoff tournament because they led the American League East when the strike began. The Milwaukee Brewers finished the second half in first place to earn the division's other playoff berth.|$|E
5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Krichell was {{involved}} in a minor scandal. Harry Nicolas was a high school baseball star in Long Island. The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with a blank check, being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas never reached the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in their front office hiring him.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Lemon {{became a}} scout for Cleveland. The next season, {{he became a}} coach with the Indians. In 1961, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies {{coaching}} staff. The California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967–1968. In 1976, Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner {{and they had been}} the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon's pitching years. In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame, Lemon was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, Krichell {{discovered}} Hank Greenberg while on a scouting trip in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg {{would be the next}} Lou Gehrig. Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Orioles began {{play in the}} AL in 1901. After two seasons, the Orioles were {{replaced}} by a club in New York City; {{it is unclear whether}} it was an expansion team or a relocated version of the Orioles. Frank Farrell and William S. Devery purchased the franchise, naming it the New York Highlanders. In 1913, the team changed its name to the Yankees. From 1921 to 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> the most successful Major League franchise, winning 20 World Series titles and 29 AL pennants. This period included streaks of four consecutive championships from 1936 to 1939 and five straight titles from 1949 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> just 1½ {{games behind}} the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly {{for the last}} month of the season. In eight games, Smith did not allow a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moved to}} the Polo Grounds for game two. Sheldon Jones took the mound for the Giants despite a 6–10 record going into the game, {{allowing}} the Giants to save Sal Maglie for the series' game three or {{the first game of}} the World Series. The Dodgers used Clem Labine, a rookie who had started just six games for the Dodgers in his career, because they lacked pitchers who were ready for the game. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> among those in attendance as spectators.|$|E
50|$|Weaver's {{time with}} <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>was</b> very turbulent, {{bouncing}} {{in and out}} of the starting rotation. In Game 4 of the 2003 World Series, he allowed a 12th inning walk-off home run to Álex González.|$|R

5|$|After Peckinpaugh, {{the captain}} of <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>was</b> traded, Babe Ruth was named the new team captain. Ruth was {{suspended}} in May 1922 and Scott was named captain in Ruth's place. Scott remained the Yankees' captain through 1925.|$|R
5|$|This was {{the first}} World Series {{appearance}} (and first National League pennant win) for the Cardinals, and {{would be the first}} of eleven World Series championships in Cardinals history. <b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in 1921 and their first world championship in 1923. They would play in another 36 World Series (and win 26 of those) {{through the end of the}} 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|After fifth-place {{finishes}} in 1968 and 1969 (the latter {{in the newly}} created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth {{by the end of}} their campaign with a record of 79–76.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>were</b> preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was, as they had not heard from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
