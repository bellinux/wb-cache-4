They flocked to our poor human doctor this morning when the fame {{of what he had}} done to the sick child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their eyes while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples or not. The {{ancestors}} of these--people precisely like them in color, dress, manners, customs, simplicity--flocked in vast multitudes after Christ, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a word, it is no wonder they worshiped Him. No wonder His deeds were <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so great that at one time--thirty miles from here--they had to let a sick man down through the roof because no approach could be made to the door; no wonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach from a ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that even in the desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His solitude, and He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their confiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great commotion in a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to another in words to this effect: [...] "They say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town was foaled May 7, 1947, in Salisbury, Maryland.

His sire line traced directly back to Black Allan. He was a bay with no white markings. <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town was sold at a dispersal sale as a weanling and went to Mississippi. From there he was sold again to an owner in Arkansas. While he was there, a Walking Horse trainer named Steve Hill came across the horse and bought a half interest in him. <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town's other owner soon put him in full-time training at Hill's Tennessee stable. Hill described <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town as an extremely tough horse to ride and handle for the first {{year and a half of}} his training. It was possibly because of this problem that the horse was gelded. Eventually, Hill was able to begin showing <b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, with much success.|$|R

Phil and Grace Archer had been married just a few months earlier, and their blossoming relationship was <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> However, searching for a story which would demonstrate some real tragedy among the increasingly unconvincing episode cliff-hangers, Godfrey Baseley had decided that Grace would have to die. It was explained to the cast as an [...] "exercise in topicality. [...] " [...] The scripts for the week of 19 September 1955 were written, recorded, and broadcast on each day.

In his maiden speech he voiced his concern that people under the age of 30 were ineligible to take up a seat in the Legislative Council. The year after his election, Glen was appointed as government whip, and it was a position that he held in government and opposition until 1970, when Don Dunstan elevated him into what is still {{regarded as one of the}} most talented ministries this state has seen.

But Canada 2 ̆ 7 s smallest province became <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> when the government of Alex B. Campbell took a bold step: it proposed to make the island a veritable laboratory for renewable energy. Thus was born the Institute of Man and Resources, whose mandate was to research, develop, and demonstrate systems for alternative energy, and resource self-sufficiency. Most often associated with the Ark, a 2 ̆ 2 bioshelter 2 ̆ 2 experiment in sustainable living, the IMR attracted a mix of back-to-the-landers, committed young engineers, scientists, and ordinary citizens interested in moving the world beyond oil. The IMR also attracted considerable attention in environmental circles, nationally and even internationally. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 This book chronicles the rise and fall of the Institute of Man and Resources, an important Canadian environmental group of the 1970 s, and contributes to the broader literature on the history of environmentalism. Indeed, as the debate over global warming sharpens public awareness once more about the repercussions of fossil fuel use, this balanced and nuanced history seems more timely and relevant than ever...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHistory plays a {{major role}} in the {{formation}} of nations. Museums of history, as they emerged during the long 19 th century, are pivotal sites for the display of national heritage and identity. The present article considers the origins of the State Historical Museum in Moscow as a “festival of public activity” and discusses its unique civic character. Although the idea of a public museum was not new, in imperial Russia it had existed only as a figment for much of the nineteenth century, until Russian National Museum (Russkii natsional’nyi muzei) was founded in 1872. The press represented the museum as an institution that should cultivate in its visitors pride for the country and “lay a foundation for national consciousness. ” The museum’s vast task—to visually represent the millennial history of the Russian state—qualified the Historical Museum as a national institution. The museum was “national” in another sense, too: it came to occupy a major place in public culture. Prepared by years of open discourse that problematized and prioritized issues of national identity in the course of which Russian society also learned the basic grammar of representation, the museum assumed a prominent place in society. Years before its opening, the Historical Museum had already become <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> Paradoxically, unlike the popular discourse built around the museum, the institution itself did not fare well. When in 1883, eleven years after its founding, the museum finally opened its doors to the public in conjunction with Alexander III’s coronation, only a fraction of the overall design was implemented. Today the newly opened State Historical Museum returns to assume the role in society that was well articulated but never realized by its progenitor: to serve as an anchor of national identity, a link between the present and the past, and a monument to a revived national tradition...|$|E
