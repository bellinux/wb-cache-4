For instance, one should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while depressed or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.|$|E

25|$|If {{the system}} is rescaled, the change in {{conductivity}} depends only on the distance between a fixed saddle point and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems that are all in different universality classes {{have been found to}} share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems that are all in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>circumstances</b> can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in quantum chromodynamics and might have been important {{in the formation of the}} early universe.|$|E
25|$|Guns. As in Europe, {{firearms}} were integrated gradually {{into local}} armies, working {{in tandem with}} the spear, bow and war-club. They sometimes compared unfavorably with traditional weapons such as poisoned arrows, or the quick charges of motivated cavalry and spearmen. As noted above, the Portuguese were unsuccessful in the Zambezi region for decades because in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>circumstances,</b> hard-driving spearmen could overwhelm musketeers. Deployment of guns was not as organized as that in Europe, where squares of gunmen drilled to deliver massed fire. A loose skirmishing formation was more common, just as it was with the bow. Guns were valued not only for their bullets but the psychological effect of their noise and smoke. They also figured prominently in the armament of small groups of royal or elite troops. One exception to this pattern appears to be Dahomey, where arquebusiers were drilled in a standardized fashion, and delivered volleys of fire with a counter-marching maneuver. Over time, most native kingdoms gradually began to use more guns, and these were eventually to change the landscape considerably. Formerly dominant kingdoms like Benin found their hegemony weakened, as new powers arose. The smaller riverine states of the Niger Delta for example began to arm their massive war-canoes with guns and cannon obtained from European sources, and began to carve out new commercial empires that nibbled away the power of the older states. This process was to accelerate in the 19th century.|$|E

If the pregnancy proceeded to a safe delivery parents now face lower energy levels and stamina because of the same reason.

40|$|The Julia {{programming}} language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia {{was designed to}} be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2.

There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing.

In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> algorithm for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>circumstance</b> and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming).
