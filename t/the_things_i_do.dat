6000|$|But <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on <b>the</b> water {{only partly}} counted. What {{completed}} everything, and won {{for me the}} title of [...] "Prince of the Oyster Beds," [...] was that I was a good fellow ashore with my money, buying drinks like a man. I little dreamed that the time would come when the Oakland water-front, which had shocked me at first would be shocked and annoyed by the devilry of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

6000|$|I hear a {{good deal}} about doing things on the [...] "spur of the moment"--I {{invariably}} regret <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{on the spur of the}} moment. That disclaimer of mine was a case in point. I am ashamed every time I think of my bursting out before an unconcerned public with that bombastic pow-wow about burning publishers' letters, and all that sort of imbecility, and about my not being an imitator, etc. Who would find out that I am a natural fool if I kept always cool and never let nature come to the surface? Nobody.|$|E

Why, Nietzsche stood in a row of ramrods in the silly old Prussian army, and Shaw takes temperance beverages in the suburbs; but <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> are unprecedented things. This round road I am treading is an untrodden path. I do believe in breaking out; I am a revolutionist.

6000|$|... "No man {{makes my}} kill." [...] Keen smote his breast a valorous blow. [...] "I {{make my own}} kill. I am glad to live when I make my own kill. When I creep through the snow upon the great moose, I am glad. And when I draw the bow, so, with my full strength, and drive the arrow fierce and swift and to the heart, I am glad. And the meat of no man's kill tastes as sweet as the meat of my kill. I am glad to live, glad in my own cunning and strength, glad that I am a doer of things, a doer of things for myself. Of what other reason to live than that? Why should I live if I delight not in myself and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> And it is because I delight and am glad that I go forth to hunt and fish, and it is because I go forth to hunt and fish that I grow cunning and strong. The man who stays in the lodge by the fire grows not cunning and strong. He is not made happy in the eating of my kill, nor is living to him a delight. He does not live. And so I say it is well this Stranger Man should go. His wisdom does not make us wise. If he be cunning, {{there is no need}} that we be cunning. If need arise, we go to him for his cunning. We eat the meat of his kill, and it tastes unsweet. We merit by his strength, and in it there is no delight. We do not live when he does our living for us. We grow fat and like women, and we are afraid to work, and we forget how to do things for ourselves. Let the man go, O Tantlatch, that we may be men! I am Keen, a man, and I make my own kill!" ...|$|E

The name Love and Death was chosen because love and death are the two most significant things you can go through in life.|$|E
