5|$|On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was {{released}} to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package. According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed Apple Maps, Facebook integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally. On September 18, 2013, Apple released iOS 7 and the iPhone 4S is among other compatible iOS devices that also receive the update without any lagging issues compared to the iPhone 4. Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which {{was released}} on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting {{that they should not}} upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> the iPad 2, but it still did not run as fast as newer models.|$|E

500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E

[...] Turner, during the trial, picked apart the {{testimony}} of eyewitness Henry Cook, and in his opening and closing statements suggested that Cook likely had been a lookout for a group of young men who broke into the poolroom to steal beer, then grabbed the coins while they were there. Turner also obtained a statement from the cab driver who had taken Gideon from Bay Harbor, Florida to a bar in Panama City, Florida, stating that Gideon was carrying neither wine, beer nor Coke when he picked him up, even though Cook testified that he had watched Gideon walk from the pool hall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> then wait for a cab.
