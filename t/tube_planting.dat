40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed at}} studying {{the correlation between}} ice plant sanitary conditions and bacteriological quality of ice. The sanitary conditions in accordance with GMP regulations, the bacteriological quality of tube ice, and the processing water in 20 plants in Bangkok were studied. A modified inspection form from the Office of Food and Drug Administration was used for sanitary condition surveys. Ice and processing water samples were collected 2 times per plant with 3 samples each time. All 120 samples were analyzed for bacteriological quality by means of Standard Plate Count technique (Pour plate method) and Most Probable Number technique (MPN method). The results indicated that forty percent (8 <b>Tube</b> <b>plants)</b> failed and the remaining passed sanitary condition criteria. 23 % of Tube Ice samples were acceptable in the standard permission level in terms of Total coliform bacteria and Fecal coliform bacteria. All <b>Tube</b> Ice <b>plant</b> processing water samples were acceptable {{in comparison with the}} standard permission level. Ice plant sanitary conditions were significantly correlated to bacteriological quality of the ice (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. The {{hot metal}} silicon content is {{important}} for the quality of the iron, but also as an indicator of the thermal state of the furnace. In order to stable operation of the blast furnace, a model is needed to predict hot metal silicon content more accurately. Towards this goal, a model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) is developed to model and predict hot metal silicon content, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted to search the optimal set of the LSSVM model parameters. Prediction experiment is conducted based on the data obtained from a blast furnace past operation records in a steel <b>tube</b> <b>plant</b> and being preprocessed in several different ways. The experimental results show that the proposed methods yielded more accurate predictions than the neural network modeling methods. ...|$|R
