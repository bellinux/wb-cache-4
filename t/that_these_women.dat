5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
25|$|In 19th-century Tasmania, {{the term}} flash mob {{was used to}} {{describe}} a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term flash language for the jargon <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> used. The 19th-century Australian term flash mob referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term flash mob or the events it describes.|$|E
25|$|As preterm {{birth is}} such a risk for women with {{multiple}} pregnancies, {{it has been suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 40 (the {{same age}} {{his father had been}} when he married), Esau took two Hittite wives, Judith the {{daughter}} of Beeri, and Basemath the daughter of Elon, who vexed Isaac and Rebecca to no end, as these women were also idol-worshippers. One reason why Isaac became blind in his old age was due to the smoke of the incense <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> offered to their idols.|$|E
25|$|Many {{women face}} issues with sexual abuse {{while working in}} {{agriculture}} fields as well. Many {{of the women who}} work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of <b>that.</b> <b>These</b> <b>women</b> may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because {{the fact that they are}} documented will be brought up and may be deported.|$|E
25|$|In addition, many aristocratic Viking women {{wanted to}} serve Freyja and {{represent}} her in Midgard. They married Viking warlords who had Odin {{as a role}} model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of Valhalla. In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the einherjar, the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by Valkyries. However, {{the duties of the}} mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle. Scholars no longer believe <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the Darraðarljóð.|$|E

5000|$|Status of Women in Tribal Society (1974) showed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> tribal <b>women</b> {{aspired to}} urban non-nomadic futures for their children, and that women’s rights in these tribes {{were based on}} tribal customs rather than Islamic or state law.|$|R

25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E
25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{argues that}} {{although}} some of these women {{may appear to be}} engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found {{that the majority of the}} women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.|$|E

500|$|One of Shakespeare's {{principal}} {{sources for}} the Three Witches {{is found in the}} account of King Duncan in Raphael Holinshed's history of Britain, The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1587). In Holinshed, the future King Macbeth of Scotland and his companion Banquo encounter [...] "three women in strange and wild apparell, resembling creatures of elder world" [...] who hail the men with glowing prophecies and then vanish [...] "immediately out of their sight". Holinshed observes that [...] "the common opinion was <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were either the Weird Sisters, that is… the goddesses of destiny, or else some nymphs or fairies endued with knowledge of prophecy by their necromantical science" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{conflict}} the rape victims {{were seen as}} a symbol of [...] "social pollution" [...] and shame. Few were able to return to families or old homes because of this. [...] Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called the victims birangona ("heroine"), but this served as a reminder <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were now deemed socially unacceptable as they were [...] "dishonored", and the term became associated with barangona ("prostitute"). The official strategy of marrying the women off and encouraging them to be seen as war heroines failed as few men came forward, and those who did expected the state to provide a large dowry. Those women who did marry were usually mistreated, and the majority of men, once having received a dowry, abandoned their wives.|$|E
500|$|Although in his {{objections}} to Wilberforce's 1786 bill Loughborough had noted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were dead {{long before they}} suffered the flames, many newspapers of the day made no such distinction. [...] The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon Devereaux's opinion, could be [...] "rooted in the growing reverence for domesticated womanhood" [...] {{that might have been}} expected at the time. [...] As many objections may also have been raised by the perceived iniquity of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at Tyburn removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged. [...] A widening gulf between the numbers of men and women whipped in London (during the 1790s, 393men versus 47women), which mirrors a similar decline in the sending of women to the pillory, may also indicate an imposition of commonly-held gender ideals on English penal practices.|$|E

In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman.

500|$|In 1912 WSPU members adopted arson {{as another}} tactic {{to win the}} vote. After Prime Minister Asquith had visited the Theatre Royal in Dublin, suffragette activists Gladys Evans, Mary Leigh, Lizzie Baker and Mabel Capper of Oxford Street, Manchester {{attempted}} to cause an explosion using gunpowder and benzine, which resulted in minimal damage. During the same evening Mary Leigh threw an axe at the carriage containing John Redmond, the Lord Mayor, and Prime Minister Asquith. Over {{the next two years}} women set fire to a refreshments building in Regent's Park, an orchid house at Kew Gardens, pillar boxes, and a railway carriage. Although Pankhurst confirmed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> had not been commanded by her or Christabel, they both assured the public that they supported the arsonist suffragettes. There were similar incidents around the country. One WSPU member, for example, put a small hatchet into the Prime Minister's carriage inscribed with the words: [...] "Votes for Women," [...] and other suffragettes used acid to burn the same slogan into golf courses used by MPs. In 1914 Mary Richardson slashed the Velasquez painting Rokeby Venus to protest against Pankhurst's imprisonment.|$|E
500|$|Original Stories {{gained a}} {{reputation}} in the 20th century as an oppressively didactic book and was derided by early scholars of children’s literature such as Geoffrey Summerfield. Recent scholars, particularly Mitzi Myers, have re-evaluated Wollstonecraft’s book and 18th-century children’s literature in general, assessing it within its historical context rather than judging it according to modern tastes. Myers suggests, in her series of seminal articles, that women writers of children’s literature such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Maria Edgeworth were not only using the genre of children’s literature to teach but also to promote visions of society distinct {{from those of the}} Romantics. These authors believed that they could effect great change by exposing young children to their ideas of a better society, even though they were [...] "only" [...] writing stories about seemingly insignificant topics such as small animals or little girls. Myers argues that because scholars have traditionally paid more attention to Romantic poetry and prose (the works of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example) than to children’s literature, they have missed the social critique <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> writers of children’s literature were offering.|$|E

2500|$|The men {{who were}} in charge of these women, either a husband, father or brother, could send these women to mental {{institutions}} stating that they believed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were mentally ill because of their strong opinions. [...] "Between the years of 1850-1900, women were placed in mental institutions for behaving in ways the male society did not agree with." [...] These men had the last say {{when it came to the}} mental health of these women, so if they believed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were mentally ill, or if they simply wanted to silence the voices and opinions of these women, they could easily send them to mental institutions. This was an easy way to render them vulnerable and submissive.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, a {{study of}} 314 women in New Zealand and Australia was done. Most {{of the women in}} the study were middle class, conservative, Protestant and white.
