5|$|Bresnahan also {{developed}} the first batting helmet. He {{was hit in}} the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E

5|$|The westernmost {{portion of}} what is now NY251 between NY383 in Scottsville and the {{junction}} of River and Quaker Roads south of the village was once part of Route15, an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. Route15 was extended northward from its original terminus in Caledonia to Scottsville via River Road on July24, 1911; however, it was realigned on March1, 1921, to enter Scottsville on modern NY383 instead. When the first set of posted routes were assigned in New York in 1924, <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> modern NY251 did not receive a designation. Another section did, however, as the portion extending from Mendon east to Victor was designated as part of NY15. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY15 was rerouted between Victor and Pittsford to follow current NY96. The former routing of NY15 from Victor to Mendon became part of NY251, a new highway extending from NY15 in Victor to NY33 in Gates via Chili and Scottsville. West of Scottsville, NY251 was routed on modern NY383 and NY386.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E

25|$|Victorian craftswoman Therese Haynes was so enamoured of Archer {{that late}} in his life, she made a {{horseshoe}} ornament from his tail hair.

25|$|The {{government}} {{of the state of}} North Carolina began to take an interest in Singletary Lake and other Carolina Bays in the 19th century. The North Carolina General Assembly blocked all further private claims on lakes. Soon after, the state assembly pass legislation that granted ownership of all lakes greater than 500acres (2.02km²) in Cumberland, Columbus and Bladen Counties to the state.
