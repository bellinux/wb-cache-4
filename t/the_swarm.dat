5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind.

In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to <b>the</b> <b>Swarm.</b> She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim <b>the</b> <b>Swarm</b> while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>swarming</b> {{mobility}} can be affect by many {{of environment}} factors. First, <b>the</b> most <b>swarming</b> strain generally requires an energy-rich, solid medium. Some of the strains like Salmonella enterica require the presence of particular supplements. P. hauseri ZMd 44 could swarm on LB agar plate without additional supplements. However, a lack of energy or carbon source would delay or inhibit such swarming characteristic to be triggered. The reason was <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> mobility was promoted by high growth rate due to the nutrient energy supports. Several strains of Proteus genus have been shown that various additional amino acids added to <b>the</b> minimal medium (<b>swarming</b> limited) agar would promote <b>the</b> <b>swarming,</b> like alanine, asparagine, and glutamic acid. This phenomenon revealed the specific amino acid could be the energy source and stimulation of swarming (Jones and Park 1967). In our previous study, copper ion significantly inhibited <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility of P. hauseri, while Mobley et al. showed that zinc ion restrict the migration of P. mirabilis.|$|R

40|$|Most marine {{bacteria}} secrete exopolysaccharide (EPS), {{which is}} important for bacterial survival in the marine environment. However, it is still unclear whether the self-secreted EPS is involved in marine bacterial motility. Here we studied the role of EPS in <b>the</b> lateral flagella-driven <b>swarming</b> motility of benthic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM 9913 (SM 9913) by a comparison of wild SM 9913 and ΔepsT, an EPS synthesis defective mutant. Reduction of EPS production in ΔepsT {{did not affect the}} growth rate or the swimming motility, but significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility on a swarming plate, suggesting that the EPS {{may play a role in}} SM 9913 <b>swarming.</b> However, <b>the</b> expression and assembly of lateral flagella in ΔepsT were not affected. Instead, ΔepsT had a different swarming behavior from wild SM 9913. <b>The</b> <b>swarming</b> of ΔepsT did not have an obvious rapid swarming period, and its rate became much lower than that of wild SM 9913 after 35 h incubation. An addition of surfactin or SM 9913 EPS on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> plate could rescue <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> level. These results indicate that the self-secreted EPS is required for <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> of SM 9913. This study widens our understanding of the function of the EPS of benthic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Motility is {{a feature}} of many {{pathogens}} {{that contributes to the}} migration and dispersion of the infectious agent. Whether gentamycin has a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) on <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> and swimming motility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine whether short-term pretreatment of sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin alter motility of E. coli and the mechanisms involved therein. Methods: After exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations (0. 8 μg/ml) of gentamicin, <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> and swimming motility of E. coli was tested in semi-solid media. Real-time PCR was used to detect the gene expression of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The production of SDH and fumarate by E. coli pretreated with or without gentamycin was measured. Fumarate was added to swarming agar to determine whether fumarate could restore <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility of E. coli. Results: After pretreatment of E. coli with sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin, swarming motility was repressed in the absence of growth inhibition. The expression of all four subunits of SDH was down-regulated, and the intracellular concentration of SDH and fumarate, produced by E. coli, were both decreased. Supplementary fumarate could restore <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility inhibited by gentamycin. A selective inhibitor of SDH (propanedioic acid) could strongly repress <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility. Conclusion: Sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamycin inhibits <b>the</b> <b>swarming</b> motility of E. coli. This effect is mediated by a reduction in cellular fumarate caused by down-regulation of SDH. Gentamycin may be advantageous for treatment of E. coli infections...|$|R

5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> being the pair which holds the territory that <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of <b>the</b> <b>swarm,</b> which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E

On the other hand in the proposed model <b>the</b> <b>swarms</b> are provided with the intelligence of a spider which enables them to avoid premature convergence and also help them to escape from local optima. The proposed approaches have been validated using a series of benchmark test functions with high dimensions.

5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into <b>the</b> <b>Swarm,</b> it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls <b>the</b> <b>Swarm</b> through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E
5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group.

50|$|The Caulobacter stalked cell stage {{provides}} a fitness advantage by anchoring the cell to surfaces to form biofilms and or to exploit nutrient sources.

This may be particularly useful in severely nutrient-limited environments when the scant resources available can be depleted very quickly.
