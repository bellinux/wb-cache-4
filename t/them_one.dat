5|$|As Pat Moran recovers in the hospital, {{he sends}} {{messengers}} out to contact {{his wife and}} child, but they all fail to find <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> day, the blind girl has lost her way and stumbles into the hospital grounds. She encounters the doctor and tells him of her story and plight. Weakly reclining in a chair nearby, Pat Moran overhears her and recognizes the girl as his daughter. The grief of the separated family abates with their reunion and doctor's assurance that the blind girl that her sight can be restored.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} North Korean defense {{halted the}} Marines. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill overwhelmed <b>them,</b> <b>one</b> hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from U.S. tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's previously successful tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise failed in the face of massive U.S. numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|Back in San Francisco, {{dental records}} matched to teeth {{found in the}} ashes lead to a young {{immigrant}} who vanished six months prior, having joined a doomsday cult. Elsewhere, this cult is seen operating as telemarketers, working in a large assembly hall as propaganda slogans are projected onto the walls around <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> of the members is apprehended by Black, and during his interrogation {{it becomes clear that}} the cult, fronting as Gehenna Industries, is brainwashing its terrified members, incinerating those who disobey.|$|E

5|$|Bank of America Stadium {{is owned}} entirely by the Panthers, making <b>them</b> <b>one</b> {{of the few}} teams in the NFL to own the {{facility}} they play in. The stadium was specially designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the Panthers. On some days the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are some exceptions, and such tours must be arranged in advance.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{was born}} in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents. In 1817, after holding several ranks in the army, he became the equerry of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the {{position}} of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them {{in the hope of}} allowing <b>them</b> <b>one</b> day to wield power through her.|$|E

5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} <b>them</b> <b>one</b> after the other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two {{of these were}} installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E
5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
5|$|Formed by Sumner and Hook {{after the}} two {{attended}} a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division soon moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made <b>them</b> <b>one</b> of the pioneers of the late-1970s post-punk movement. The band's self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew {{the attention of the}} Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to the city center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between <b>them</b> <b>one</b> tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society held {{a celebration}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them. He was by this point the only {{remaining}} member of the zoo's original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration {{of him and his}} influence on <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the visual representations of the institution, the university's individual departments, faculties, and schools also employ symbols to visually represent <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> such example is the Faculty of Engineering's fireball emblem, adopted by the faculty in 1960. The fireball was adopted from the coat of arms of the defunct Hamilton College.|$|E

5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} neutralise the Würzburg system by developing countermeasures against it, Jones {{and his team}} needed to study one of the systems, {{or at least the}} more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed. Fortunately for <b>them,</b> <b>one</b> such site had recently been sighted by an RAF reconnaissance Spitfire from the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit during a flight over part of the French English Channel coast near Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Isolated seamounts {{and those}} without clear {{volcanic}} origins are less common; examples include Bollons Seamount, Eratosthenes Seamount, Axial Seamount and Gorringe Ridge. If all known seamounts were collected into one area, {{they would make}} a landform the size of Europe. Their overall abundance makes <b>them</b> <b>one</b> of the most common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth, a sort of exploratory frontier.|$|E

5|$|McClellan did {{not believe}} his army {{was ready for a}} battle, and hoped that Lee would not give <b>them</b> <b>one.</b> Nonetheless, he left his troops at Malvern Hill and {{traveled}} downstream aboard the ironclad USS Galena to inspect his army's future resting place at Harrison's Landing. McClellan did not delegate an interim commander; Porter, who was in command during the initial attack, became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{critics also}} {{mentioned}} its presentation. Stella praised the visuals {{and enjoyed the}} music despite it sounding dated, while Hatfield praised the music but criticized the graphics as uninspired. Reddick praised the visual overhaul, despite limited animation for sprites outside battle. Dutton echoed Hatfield's sentiments about the visuals, finding <b>them</b> <b>one</b> of his main criticisms of the presentation alongside the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Nirvana's active career ended {{following}} the death of Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love.
