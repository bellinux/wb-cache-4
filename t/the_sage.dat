5|$|Seven years later, {{an older}} Link awakens {{in an area}} of the Sacred Realm known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru, one of the seven sages who protect the {{entrance}} to the Sacred Realm. Rauru explains that Link's spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf, who has now taken over Hyrule. The seven sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are unaware of their identities as sages. Link is returned to the Temple of Time; there he meets the mysterious Sheik, who guides him to free five temples from Ganondorf's control, allowing each temple's sage to awaken. Link befriended all five sages as a child: Saria, <b>the</b> <b>Sage</b> of the Forest Temple; Darunia, <b>the</b> <b>Sage</b> of the Fire Temple; Ruto, <b>the</b> <b>Sage</b> of the Water Temple; Impa, <b>the</b> <b>Sage</b> of the Shadow Temple; and Nabooru, <b>the</b> <b>Sage</b> of the Spirit Temple. After the five sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Zelda in disguise, and the seventh sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the Triforce of Power, while Zelda received the Triforce of Wisdom and Link the Triforce of Courage.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana {{presents}} a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> is Vashista {{and the king}} is Vishwamitra. Once, king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista. <b>The</b> <b>sage</b> welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary {{for the performance of}} the sacred rituals and charity by <b>the</b> <b>sage.</b> Agitated, Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king's men. She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king's army and <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> followed her wish. Intensely, she produced Pahlava warriors, who were slain by Vishwamita's army. So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage. From her mouth, emerged the Kambhojas, from her udder Barvaras, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores on her skin, Haritas, Kiratas and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra's army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista.|$|E

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of <b>the</b> <b>sage)</b> into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. <b>The</b> <b>sage,</b> with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. <b>The</b> <b>sage</b> then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, <b>the</b> <b>sage</b> bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E

50|$|As per Hindu legend, god Shiva was strolling in Thillai Vanam.

He was followed by his consort, Vishnu as Mohini. <b>The</b> <b>sages</b> and their wives were enchanted by {{the beauty of the}} pair. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, <b>the</b> <b>sages</b> got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (nāgas) by performing rituals. Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on his matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, <b>the</b> <b>sages</b> invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Shiva as a shawl around his waist. Then followed a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Shiva (the sequence derived the name Gajasamharamurthy to Shiva). <b>The</b> <b>sages</b> gathered all their spiritual strength and invoked a powerful demon Muyalakan - a symbol of complete arrogance and ignorance. Shiva wore a gentle smile, stepped on the demon's back, immobilized him and performed the Ánanda Tandava (the dance of eternal bliss) and disclosed his true form. <b>The</b> <b>sages</b> surrendered and understood the ultimate realisation that god cannot be controlled by the rituals.|$|R
