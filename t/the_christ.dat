5|$|Australian-American actor Mel Gibson is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the episode; his voice was impersonated by André Sogliuzzo. Gibson directed the film The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> 2: Crucify This. The fictional sequel {{is a combination of}} The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> and Rush Hour (1998), and stars Chris Tucker, who starred in Rush Hour, and Jim Caviezel who portrayed Jesus in The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Biblical {{scenes and}} figures {{depicted}} in the Church of the Holy Mother of God include the worshiping of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> child as the eucharistic victim (the Melismos) in {{the lower part of}} the apse, the raising of Lazarus, the Annunciation, Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, the Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in the upper part of the cella, the Descent from the Cross, the mourning of Jesus, and the Dormition of the Theotokos on the west wall. The north and south walls of the cella, as well as the wall piers, bear frescoes of saints, including rare images of military saints on horseback. Murals of Saint Petka and Saint Nicholas were painted in the upper reaches of the narthex, in the south and the north tower respectively.|$|E

5|$|Many Christians {{believe the}} star was a miraculous sign {{to mark the}} birth of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that the star {{fulfilled}} a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link the star to unusual astronomical events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a comet or a supernova.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{appearance}} of the icon is unclear: although the early image has been interpreted as a bust of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Pantocrator type, late Byzantine references, such as coins by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and the Deesis mosaic in the Chora Church, use the term for depictions of a standing Christ on a pedestal.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christ</b> Church {{scriptorium}} {{was particularly}} active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting {{of the documents}} produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite elegant, the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad grammar and other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christ</b> myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ending {{was to have}} John killed, and {{his image}} kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film. McG and Nolan did continue <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> element of John's character though, {{in which he has}} some followers who believe what he knows about Skynet and others who do not.|$|E

5|$|To the {{immediate}} south-west {{of the church}} building, St Botolph's Aldersgate owned an irregularly shaped churchyard enclosed by Aldersgate Street to the east, <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Church Greyfriars burial ground to the west, housing and the burial ground of St Leonard, Foster Lane, {{to the south and}} housing along Little Britain to the north. The churchyard was used as a burial ground and as a public open space.

5|$|While Aronofsky's {{other movies}} have evoked {{significant}} emotional response, {{they were still}} far from the turmoil aroused by Noah. It was screened {{for the first time}} on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> or The Da Vinci Code. Noah has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

He will not fret himself, lest he should do evil; because he can always put his trust in the Lord, until the tyranny be overpast. He will not hastily rebel: but neither will he truckle basely and cowardly to the ways of this wicked world. For <b>Christ</b> <b>the</b> Lord hates those ways, and has judged them, and doomed them to destruction; and he reigns, and will reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.|$|R
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ,</b> a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> the King Church.|$|E
5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion of <b>the</b> <b>Christ</b> in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor. The film garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as various accolades.|$|E
