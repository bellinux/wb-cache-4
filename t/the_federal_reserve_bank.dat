In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank.

A member bank is a privately owned bank that must buy an amount equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus of stock in the <b>Reserve</b> <b>Bank</b> within its region of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> System. This stock [...] "may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan" [...] and all member banks receive a 6% annual dividend. No stock in any <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Bank</b> has ever been sold to the public, to foreigners, or to any non-bank U.S. firm. These member banks must maintain fractional reserves either as vault currency or on account at its <b>Reserve</b> <b>Bank.</b> As of October 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> has paid interest to banks' holdings in Reserve Banks' accounts. The dividends paid by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Banks</b> to member banks are considered partial compensation for the lack of interest paid on the required reserves.
