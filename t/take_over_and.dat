5|$|Found in open woodland, {{parks and}} gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater {{is common in}} {{northern}} and eastern Australia and southern New Guinea. It appears to be sedentary in parts of its range and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to <b>take</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E

5|$|The {{improvement}} of the road from Buffalo southwest to Pennsylvania in the mid-19th century soon allowed for continuous travel across {{the entire state of}} New York. With the advent of the automobile, the state began to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> pave major thoroughfares {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. In 1908, the state legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes. One of the routes assigned at this time was Route6, an Albany–Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike from Buffalo to Utica, the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady, and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany. From Auburn to Chittenango, Route6 utilized most of the newer, northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the Red Army {{reconnaissance}} and sabotage detachments {{were formed}} {{under the supervision}} of the Second Department of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces. These forces were subordinate to front commanders. The infamous NKVD internal security and espionage agency also had their own special purpose (osnaz) detachments, including many saboteur teams who were airdropped into enemy-occupied territories to work with (and often <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> lead) the Soviet Partisans.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} made in two versions: a {{cinematic}} version in Norwegian and a television version in English. First Solum would direct a scene in Norwegian, {{and it would be}} shot.

The actors' accents were good enough that it {{did not need to be}} dubbed, while sufficiently noticeable to make the film exotic and authentic. A documentary about the production was shot concurrently.|$|E

Schäffer soon planned a full-blown naval assault on the Hawaiian islands. His actions were not sanctioned by RAC governor Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, who gave no instructions beyond either regaining the lost company items or compensation for them in sandalwood.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding {{his general}} support for Milošević in this period, Bajatović {{ultimately}} became aligned with a reformist faction in the Socialist Party led by Ivica Dačić. He remarked in September 2002 that the party's relationship with Milošević {{would need to}} become more reciprocal, noting that some of Milošević's recent communications to the party could be perceived as dictates. He accused Milošević's wife Mirjana Marković of trying to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> radicalize the party, and he opposed Milošević's efforts to place Bogoljub Bjelica into a position of party leadership.|$|E
25|$|The ages of {{the victims}} ranged from six to thirteen. According to The Washington Post, police and coroner {{accounts}} of the children's wounds differed dramatically; Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said Roberts shot his victims in the head at close range, with 17 or 18 shots fired in all, including the one he used to take his own life as police stormed into the school by breaking through the window glass. Janice Ballenger, deputy coroner in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, counted {{at least a dozen}} shotgun pellet inflicted wounds in one child alone before asking a colleague to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> continue for her.|$|E

25|$|They had a {{difficult}} relationship with the Mamluks of Egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state. Their competition centered over the Hejaz {{and the right to}} provide kiswa of the Ka'aba in Mecca. The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession, combined by periodic tribal revolts, as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands. During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule, the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom. The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the Banu Taher clan to <b>take</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> establish themselves as the new rulers of Yemen in 1454 AD.|$|E
25|$|Both freight and {{passenger}} services have featured at Lyttelton since it opened in 1867. With the cessation of suburban passenger trains to Lyttelton in the 1970s, freight became the mainstay of the railways’ business at Lyttelton and today passenger traffic from Lyttelton plays only a minor role. Tranz Scenic have run a limited tourist service from the station in recent years during the summer season though patronage of these trains is limited to cruise ship passengers. Proposals {{have been made to}} reinstate a commuter rail service from Lyttelton, however this is not considered to be a realistic possibility for the foreseeable future. Operations at Lyttelton have included all three forms of motive power, with steam being dominant until the late 1960s when diesel began to <b>take</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> electric power from 1929 to 1970. All trains at Lyttelton are now diesel-hauled.|$|E
25|$|For IIIAC, the {{cease-fire}} agreement meant a lessening of the hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, {{but there was}} never a time in the following months when a guard detachment could consider itself safe. By March, political and military differences had again split China wide open and, although a pretense at negotiation continued, clashes increased between Communists and Nationalists. Neither side was blameless in the covert renewal of hostilities, but the major share of blame fell to the Communists, who definitely violated the January 10 agreement in March and April by moving troops from Shansi and Hopeh into Manchuria. With the assistance of the Soviet occupation forces, which conveniently withdrew when Chinese Communists arrived to <b>take</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> which left large stockpiles of Japanese weapons and munitions behind, Mao Zedong managed to strengthen his forces considerably during {{the cease-fire}}.|$|E
