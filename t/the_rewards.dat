5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of <b>the</b> <b>rewards</b> and dangers of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to <b>the</b> <b>rewards</b> of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, <b>the</b> <b>rewards</b> for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study.

40|$|The {{factors that}} {{contribute}} to individual differences in <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> value of cute infant facial characteristics are poorly understood.

By contrast, maternal tendencies did not predict women’s subjective ratings of the cuteness of these infant faces. These results show, for the first time, that <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> value of infant facial cuteness is greater among women who report being more interested in interacting with infants, implicating maternal tendencies in individual differences in <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> value of infant cuteness. Moreover, our results indicate that the relationship between maternal tendencies and <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> value of infant facial cuteness is not due to individual differences in women’s ability to detect infant cuteness.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ability of three chimpanzees and three orangutans to track {{the position of a}} reward after a series of displacements. <b>The</b> <b>reward</b> was placed under one of two opaque containers resting on a platform. Experiment 1 investigated rotational displacements in which the platform was rotated 0 °, 180 °, or 360 °. Experiment 2 investigated transpositional displacements in which the platform remained stationary while the containers either remained stationary, or swapped their positions (in a one- two- or three-step sequence). In both experiments, the initial position of <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> was indicated either by directly showing <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> under <b>the</b> containers, or by placing a landmark, which had been previously associated with <b>the</b> <b>reward,</b> on top of the baited container.

5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. <b>The</b> <b>rewards</b> that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E
5|$|William of Poitiers {{describes}} a council called by Duke William, {{in which the}} writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, {{it is unlikely that}} any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of <b>the</b> <b>rewards</b> from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife {{for the duration of the}} invasion.|$|E

Two conflicting approaches are considered. In the developmental approach the task structure {{is seen as the}} key element in explaining why cooperative learning works or not. In the motivational approach <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> structure is seen as the core element.

With simple tasks <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> structure hardly needs special attention. Feedback on task accomplishment is sufficient. With more complex tasks <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> structure needs more fine tuning with the task. Key words: cooperative learning; primary school; task structure; reward structur...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} {{faced by}} firms that undertake crowdsourcing-contests to get solutions from crowds to their problems is to design an incentive structure which helps attract high quality solutions.

Using data from Threadless. com, we find that participants exert less effort as competition for <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> increases. This indicates that increasing <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> may adversely {{affect the quality of}} the solutions produced as it will increase the competition. However, counter-intuitively the policy simulations indicate that increasing <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> increases both <b>the</b> quantity and quality of submitted solutions. This is because under the new policy of higher reward, individual equilibrium behavior is different.

30|$|Figures 2 and 3 show <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> {{performance}} for different values of v 1, where v 0 = 100 m/s in Figure 2 and v 0 = 50 m/s in Figure 3. It is observed that <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> performance of <b>the</b> proposed overhead & speed method {{is better than}} all the other methods, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> and <b>the</b> importance of considering both the moving speed and the handoff overhead in making the inter-relay handoff decisions. It is seen that <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> performance of <b>the</b> overhead method varies significantly with the moving speed. When the actual moving speed v 1 is close to the original speed, for example, around 100 m/s in Figure 2 and 50 m/s in Figure 3, the difference between the proposed method and the overhead method is the minimum. In this case, the effect of the moving speed changes on <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> performance is much less than that of the handoff overhead. As the difference between the actual moving speed (v 1) and the original moving speed (v 0) increases, i.e., v 1 either much smaller or much larger than v 0, the gap between the overhead method and the proposed method increases, because of the increasing effect of the moving speed on the SNR, which eventually affects the transmission rate and <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> function. By taking into consideration the moving speed changes in deriving the channel state transition matrix and making the handoff decisions, <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> performance of both the proposed and the speed methods keeps almost constant when the train is moving at different speeds. Although <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> performance of <b>the</b> conventional method also keeps unchanged with the moving speed, its reward function is lower than both the proposed one and the speed one, because it does not consider the effects of the moving speed and handoff overhead on <b>the</b> <b>reward.</b> <b>The</b> effect of the moving speed on <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> function in <b>the</b> conventional method can be complicated. On one hand, using this handoff method allows the MS to always connect to the best RS that provides it with the highest transmission rate, which increases the reward; on the other hand, this increases the number of handoffs and reduce <b>the</b> <b>reward.</b> Overall, as we can observe from the figures that <b>the</b> <b>reward</b> is not very much sensitive to the moving speed.|$|R
