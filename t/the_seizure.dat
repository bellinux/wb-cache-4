5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> remains.|$|E

5|$|Both Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German fleet. Irene frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht on cruises throughout Europe. In 1894, Irene was deployed to East Asian waters; Prinzess Wilhelm joined her the following year. Prinzess Wilhelm {{was one of}} three ships involved in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> of the naval base Kiaochou Bay in November 1897, led by Admiral Otto von Diederichs. Irene was in dock for engine maintenance at the time, and so she was not present during the operation. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>seizure,</b> the Cruiser Division was reorganized as the East Asia Squadron. Both ships were present in the Philippines {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Diederichs hoped to use the crisis as an opportunity to seize another naval base in the region, though this was unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|In {{epilepsy}} surgery {{a distinction}} {{can be made}} between resective and disconnective procedures. In a resective procedure {{the area of the}} brain that causes <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> is removed. In a disconnective procedure the neural connections in the brain that allow <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> to spread are disconnected. In most cases epilepsy surgery is only an option when the area of the brain that causes <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> - <b>the</b> so-called epileptic focus can be clearly identified and is not responsible for critical functions such as language. Several imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance tomography and functional techniques like electrocorticography are used to demarcate the epileptic focus clearly.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{a person}} is {{considered}} to be a potential candidate for surgery if adequate trials of two first-line seizure medicines (ones that are commonly effective in controlling <b>the</b> type of <b>seizures</b> <b>the</b> person is experiencing) and one two-drug combination all have failed to control <b>the</b> <b>seizures.</b> A trial of a medication is considered adequate when it has been increased gradually to the maximum dosage that does not cause serious side effects and then is given for a long enough period. If the person has frequent seizures, any improvement will be obvious after a short time. If <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> generally occur far apart, however, it may take months to determine whether <b>the</b> time between <b>seizures</b> is increasing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gelastic {{epilepsy}} {{has been}} reported to originate from various conditions, particularly from hypothalamic hamartoma (HH). In the present study, we report a patient with gelastic seizures (GSs), followed by complex partial and tonic-clonic seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a rare combination of HH and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Following resectioning of <b>the</b> HH, <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> were reduced, but not fully controlled, with medica-tion by the one year follow-up. HH and partial ACC patients may experience seizures; <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> in <b>the</b> case presented in this study may have originated from HH, partial ACC or both. Considering <b>the</b> fact that <b>seizure</b> frequency reduced following surgery, they may have mainly occurred from HH. Additionally it was considered to be likely that <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> following surgery were due to secondary epileptogenesis, partial ACC, or both...|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> of the 377 hostages, NATO did {{not carry}} out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E

50|$|To qualify, {{documentation}} to the Social Security Administration of an EEG detailing {{a typical}} seizure is required, though a normal diagnosis does {{not rule out}} benefits.

40|$|Purpose: The {{understanding}} of brain activity, {{and in particular}} events such as epileptic <b>seizures,</b> lies on <b>the</b> characterisation {{of the dynamics of}} the neural networks. The theory of non-linear dynamics provides signal analysis techniques which may give new information on the behaviour of such networks. Methods: We calculated correlation dimension maps for 19 -channel EEG data from 3 patients with a total of 7 absence <b>seizures.</b> <b>The</b> signals were analysed before, during and after <b>the</b> <b>seizures.</b> Phase randomised surrogate data was used to test chaos. Results: In <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> of two patients we could distinguish two dynamical regions on the cerebral cortex, one that seemed to exhibit chaos whereas the other seemed to exhibit noise. The pattern shown is essentially <b>the</b> same for <b>seizures</b> triggered by hyperventilation, but differ for seizures triggered by light flashes. The chaotic dynamics that one seems to observe is determined by a small number of variables and has low complexity. On the other hand, in <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> of another patient no chaotic region was found. Before and during <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> no chaos was found either, in all cases. Conclusions: The application of non-linear signal analysis revealed the existence of differences in the spatial dynamics associated to absence seizures. This may contribute to the {{understanding of}} those seizures and be of assistance in clinical diagnosis. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} types of {{seizures}}, gelastic seizures are hard to control {{for an extended period}} of time. The best outlook is for children suffering <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> due to a benign tumor in their hypothalamus. The removal of these tumors can be effective not only for the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>seizures,</b> but also <b>the</b> behavioral and cognitive symptoms that come along with the syndrome.Cases have also been found that anti epileptic drugs have stopped seizures fully.|$|R
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Italian fleet {{for the first}} decade of their careers. They saw action in the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912, where they participated in <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> of Cyrenaica in North Africa and operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict.

25|$|Increases in {{pseudoephedrine}} diversion were noted, {{beginning with}} <b>the</b> <b>seizures</b> in March and April 2003 of four shipments of product destined for Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred in <b>the</b> United States and Panama, and totaled over 22 million, 60-milligram pseudoephedrine tablets.

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower <b>the</b> <b>seizure</b> threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
