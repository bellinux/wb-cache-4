5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people <b>think</b> <b>this</b> to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to <b>think.</b> <b>This</b> points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever <b>think</b> <b>this</b> film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E

5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker if you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of {{the north and west}} sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner <b>think</b> <b>this</b> may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{point out}} that the story is linked to the {{preceding}} account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. Some <b>think</b> <b>this</b> proximity of the stories results from the work of a redactor. On the other hand, according to Saul Zalewski, the two accounts are inseparable and form a literary unified unit.|$|E
25|$|The group {{recorded}} {{their debut}} five-track extended play, I <b>Think</b> <b>this</b> Town is Nervous, which was issued by Hot Records in December 1985.

25|$|Criticism of {{the term}} {{intellectual}} property ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors <b>think</b> <b>this</b> term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform {{in the public interest}} or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.|$|E
25|$|While {{some public}} health officials, pediatricians, {{and social workers}} wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, others did not <b>think</b> <b>this</b> would solve the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, director of the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people <b>think</b> <b>this</b> way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
25|$|Following this, {{businessman}} and friend Paul Sykes announced {{his intention to}} cease his partial funding of UKIP and to return his support to the Conservatives, as he feared that the Euro-sceptic vote might be split. The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk's challenge for the party leadership.
