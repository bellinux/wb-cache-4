500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. [...] "It just didn't happen'" [...] says Payne. [...] "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think {{that by the end of}} that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not the}} characters' simple speech helps build basic {{language}} skills has been debated. Los Angeles Times critic Lynne Heffley commended the interactive aspects of the show but mentioned that the simplified dialogue can distract from the educational content. She writes, [...] "the repetition of single words and use of incomplete sentences ... offer a mixed result: at times seeming too babyish, at other times effectively underscoring concepts, ideas and vocabulary." [...] In her Common Sense Media review, Andrea Graham stated that the language [...] "should {{not be seen as}} detrimental to a child's speech development – rather, it's a language that young children understand and appreciate." [...] Jaime Egan of Families.com wrote negatively of the dialogue but felt that it did not divert from the educational value. She wrote that [...] "even though the characters do not speak in complete sentences ... the lessons that this show teaches can be invaluable." [...] The hosts of Ray William Johnson's Equals Three criticized the simplified language, stating that the puppets [...] "didn't even use full sentences. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> enough words to make themselves understood." [...] Amy Sohn of New York magazine expressed her opinion that the language ruined the show as a whole, calling the characters [...] "speech-impaired." [...] The Star Tribunes James Lileks deemed the series [...] "brain-rotting," [...] and Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press called Oobis writers [...] "lazy" [...] for using such a simple concept.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of spontaneous speech is the abundance of speech repairs, in which speakers go back and repeat or change something <b>they</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> In other work [7], we proposed a language model for speech recognition that can detect and correct speech repairs in English. In this paper, we show that this model works equally as well on a Japanese corpus of spontaneous speech. The structure of the model captures the language independent aspect of speech repairs, while machine training techniques on an annotated corpus learn the language dependent aspects. 1. INTRODUCTION One of the biggest challenges in recognizing and understanding spontaneous speech is dealing with speech repairs, where speakers go back and change or repeat something <b>they</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> The following illustrates an English speech repair from the Trains corpus [6], a corpus of humanhuman task-oriented spoken dialogs.

5000|$|Ahenobarbus was a cognomen {{used by a}} plebeian {{branch of}} the gens Domitia in the late Roman Republic and early Empire. [...] The name means [...] "red-beard" [...] (literally, [...] "bronze-beard") in Latin. According to legend, Castor and Pollux {{announced}} {{to one of their}} ancestors the victory of the Romans over the Latins at the battle of Lake Regillus, and, to confirm the truth of what <b>they</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> <b>they</b> stroked his black hair and beard, which immediately became red.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> ' you,' because they were so tired of this [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} {{and it is}} sadly true, that in our society, people {{do not like to}} read for {{pleasure}} as in other cultures. Sometimes, it is really difficult for teachers to make their students read, not only because it is difficult for them reading in another language, but also because they do not even read in their mother tongue. We can say this because we have talked and interviewed our students from different courses of the university that we have worked at for more than eight years, and most of them say {{that they do not have}} time, that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> do not like to read, that they are really busy doing other activities, or <b>they</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that it is a boring activity. Besides, if they do not read in their mother tongue because they do not like it, or they do not find the material interesting,why do we think as teachers that they are going to read any material? Why are they going to read something that sometimes they do not even understand or is tedious for them? Consequently, it is important for teachers to make their students develop good habits in reading, because teachers know and realize that with reading [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Ladd offered Lucas some of {{the only}} support from the studio; he dealt with {{scrutiny}} from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. Initially, Fox approved $8million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: [...] "we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things. Then, {{it was obvious that}} 8million wasn't going to do it—they had approved 8million." [...] After requests from the team that [...] "it had to be more", the executives [...] "got a bit scared". For two weeks, Lucas and his crew [...] "didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures". At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. Kurtz said that [...] "it came out to be like 9.8 or [...]9 or something like that, and in the end <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yes, that's okay, we'll go ahead.

2500|$|Afterwards, the {{incident}} has caused some debates {{because it is}} rare that a Christian black metal band gets signed to a secular label. Previously only Horde's release of Hellig Usvart in 1994 on Nuclear Blast is a similar known case. In December 1998, the drummer Armoth {{said in an interview}} with the Art for the Ears webzine that they sent the CD and a short biography for Cacophonous Records and that Cacophonous Records just wanted to sign Antestor because of the music, which was exactly what the band wanted to do. Some time later, in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth).

40|$|The {{residual}} fluctuations {{that naturally}} arise in experimental inquiry are analyzed {{in terms of}} their time histories. Although these fluctuations are generally relegated to a statistical purgatory known as unexplained variance, this article shows that they may harbor a long-term memory process known as 1 /f noise. This type of noise has been encountered in a number of biological and physical systems and is theorized to be a signature of dynamic complexity. Its presence in psychological data appears {{to be associated with the}} most elementary aspect of cognitive process, the formation of representations. The work described here concerns memory and the temporal evolution of cognitive activity. Although many of the ideas presented make little contact with current cognitive theories, almost all of the empirical work derives from the well-known observation that memory inevitably makes an appearance in repeated episodes of measurement. Explicit memory, for example, was a bedeviling factor in the early studies of magnitude estimation, signal detection, and absolute identification.

40|$|Sometimes {{a person}} may require the {{previous}} speaker to repeat, explain, confirm, etc., what <b>they</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> Such "other-initiations of repair," as they are called, usually come sharply. On occasion, however, they are issued some time after the offending talk has passed. This might pose a puzzle to the previous speaker who would normally expect problems to be identified immediately. This article argues that recipients can help them by signaling that their other-initiation has, for whatever reason, become separated from {{the source of the}} trouble. This is first shown for the particular practice of using "you mean [...] . " to check one's understanding. A variety of similar practices are then collected together to suggest that the need for managing this puzzle is quite generic and widespread. Finally, it is shown that such practices can have consequences for our understanding of repair more broadly. Examining their use allows us to refine our characterization of where other-initiations normally occur and provides evidence that this contiguous positioning is preferred over noncontiguous positioning...|$|R
