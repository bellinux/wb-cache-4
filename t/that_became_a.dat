5|$|A special side story, titled , was {{developed}} by Toriyama and published together with chapter 386 on August 31, 1992, in issue No. 36/37 of Weekly Shōnen Jump. Toriyama created a short series, Neko Majin, <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> self-parody of Dragon Ball. First appearing in August 1999, the eight-chapter series was released sporadically in Weekly Shōnen Jump and Monthly Shōnen Jump until it was completed in 2005. These chapters were compiled into one kanzenban volume released on April 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Banks and Bob Nelson {{became the}} first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company {{dealership}} in 1967. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an import car dealership before the venture with Banks. Banks was appointed {{to the board of directors}} of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969. On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> proud possession.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he {{supplies}} 007 with {{a modified}} Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> {{hallmark of the}} series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, {{with the exception of}} Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E

5|$|For , {{a planned}} {{expansion}} to Halo 3 <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> full game, O'Donnell and Salvatori abandoned all previous Halo themes and started anew. Due to ODSTs {{shift to a}} new protagonist, O'Donnell created new music that was evocative of past Halo but branched in a different direction. Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, detective story feel, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the film noir atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} celebrity of sorts at Michigan. He was {{mentioned}} in several issues of Time magazine, and his wedding was even {{announced in the}} magazine. In addition, his time at Michigan defined an era in a way <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> permanent reference because his contemporaries would {{say that they were}} at Michigan in the Chappuis years. In 1988, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10' latitude. He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.|$|E

The Bridgewater Canal and the Leigh Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal cross the town west to east, the canals meeting at Leigh Bridge just south of the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans {{the opportunity to develop}} a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> cornerstone in the history of human civilization. Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley {{through the end of the}} Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.|$|E
5|$|The show's monologues are sourced {{largely from}} Beckerman's book. The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell.

5|$|The {{third group}} are those churches {{established}} as new cathedrals since the Reformation. They include five great medieval abbey churches established as new cathedrals under Henry VIII: Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and Peterborough. Five further large churches later became cathedrals: St Albans and Southwark, which were of monastic foundation, and Manchester, Ripon, and Southwell, which were collegiate churches (and {{all of which}} consequently combine the functions of cathedral and parish church). Westminster Abbey was a Benedictine monastery <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> cathedral after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but only for ten years.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> {{part of the}} GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 1/9 were removed, while Route 25T became US 1/9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1/9 Business (now Route 139). In 1964, the US 1/9 {{approaches to the}} George Washington Bridge, which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side, were rebuilt into a freeway <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> part of I-95. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township, {{which was the first}} cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1/9 was a part of Route 25, was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E

5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Sangam {{literature}} of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia. In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> model for later Indian kingdoms. Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself. The renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite. Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> part of Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from {{the time when the}} English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although the themes, {{events and}} {{characters}} of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, {{and there is no}} one canonical version; Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. Many elements and incidents that are now {{an integral part of the}} Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance <b>that</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.|$|E
