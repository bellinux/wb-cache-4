5|$|Although London {{has many}} ties to Middlesex County, it is a <b>totally</b> {{separate}} entity; {{the two have}} no jurisdictional overlap. The exception is the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail, as the judiciary is administered directly by the province.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was not <b>totally</b> {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service. The advances in machinery and armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily the equal of even a modern armoured cruiser, and was <b>totally</b> outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought {{played a major role in}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} organs include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, {{which can be}} partially or <b>totally</b> fused. There {{may also be a}} range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream that is <b>totally</b> condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead {{is not easily}} condensed <b>totally</b> and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be <b>totally</b> excluded.|$|E
5|$|Jim's {{health is}} excellent. That's {{not the reason}} he didn't {{participate}} in (Bat III).

His health in no way impacted on his involvement in the Bat Out of Hell project.|$|E
5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was <b>totally</b> {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
5|$|June 6–7, 1832 – The {{center of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone passes over or {{very close to the}} islands. Two schooners in St. George's Harbour are driven aground, and several houses are partially or <b>totally</b> unroofed. Tree damage is extensive.|$|E
5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until {{during the first}} {{millennium}} BCE he {{came to be seen}} as a <b>totally</b> malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E

5|$|Roslin {{was more}} {{severely}} {{damaged by the}} Earl of Hertford, who burned the castle during the War of the Rough Wooing in 1544. The keep was almost <b>totally</b> destroyed, although its one remaining ruined wall can still be seen.|$|E

This figure {{did not include}} financial losses in coastal cities.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{substantial}} hobby devoted to collecting old toy soldiers, {{with an abundance of}} small manufacturers, dealers, and toy soldier shows. There are published articles of these figures in some magazines, such as Plastic Warrior Magazine, and there are also published books <b>totally</b> or partially devoted to these figures.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>totally</b> {{reliable}} {{test for}} Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as {{well of the}} amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression {{of the amount of}} copper in the body. The gold standard—or most ideal test—is a liver biopsy.|$|E
5|$|You know, I {{think the}} Triton kind of, I think was a spur for that routine as I think back. Because I then {{imagined}} what a trip {{like that would}} have been like with a <b>totally</b> incompetent commander, and the cruise of USS Codfish was the final result.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Trevor Potts re-enacted the Boat Journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia {{in honour of}} Sir Ernest Shackleton, <b>totally</b> unsupported, in {{a replica}} of the James Caird.

25|$|Table 1 of an April 2008 {{discussion}} {{paper from the}} Centre for European Economic Research by Heinemann et al. analysed each Group's stance on a hypothetical generalised EU tax. The results for each Group are given in the diagram on the right with the horizontal scale scaled so that -100% = <b>totally</b> against and 100% = <b>totally</b> for. The results are also given in the table below, rescaled so that 0% = <b>totally</b> against, 100% = <b>totally</b> for.|$|E
25|$|There {{were certain}} groups who took {{to it with}} great enthusiasm, other groups were {{directly}} lukewarm and other hostile, each profession reacted differently. The social workers took to it with enthusiasm; the psychoanalysts treated it with caution, curiously and for me infuriatingly pediatricians were initially hostile but subsequently many of them became very supporting; adult psychiatrists <b>totally</b> uninterested, <b>totally</b> ignorant, <b>totally</b> uninterested.|$|E
25|$|While {{chain is}} {{sometimes}} merely {{a synonym for}} <b>totally</b> ordered set, it can also refer to a <b>totally</b> ordered subset of some partially ordered set. The latter definition has {{a crucial role in}} Zorn's lemma.|$|E

25|$|A newly {{acquired}} subsidiary {{is one example}} of where it might be suitable for an area to be simultaneously not-so-stubby and <b>totally</b> stubby if the practical place to put an ASBR is {{on the edge of a}} <b>totally</b> stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the <b>totally</b> stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. In Cisco's implementation, the external routes can be summarized before injecting them into the <b>totally</b> stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an advertisement makes sense.|$|E
