5|$|Parker and Colesberry {{looked at}} {{locations}} near Jackson, Mississippi, where {{they set up}} production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel.

Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being shot {{in a number of}} locales in Mississippi.|$|E

It delivered the ground attack version the following year for evaluation, although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but {{it was decided to}} give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a versatile horse, appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred trotting horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du cheval français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du cheval français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as versatile horses <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> both riding and driving.|$|E
