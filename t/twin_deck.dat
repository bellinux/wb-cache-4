5000|$|The current Government Bridge is {{the fourth}} {{crossing}} of the Mississippi in this vicinity, having been built in 1896 on the same location and using the same piers as the 1872 structure. It too is a <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> structure that carries both rail (top level) and road traffic (bottom level), but it increased the rail lines from one to two to ease what had become a rail traffic bottleneck. It was designed by Ralph Modjeski and built by the Phoenix Bridge Company.

5000|$|The {{company has}} been {{building}} ferries since at least 1985, when the 60 passenger Island Princess was delivered to Scottish owners, and she still operates as a whale watching boat off the Isle of Mull. Several further ferry orders followed including the 29 m Roll-on/roll-off ferry Eynhallow for Orkney Ferries in 1987, and the 19 m Maid of the Forth for the Forth River in 1989. In 2001 Abels secured a contract to build a <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> ferry for the Portsmouth Harbour Ferry Company. Shortly afterwards the company was awarded a follow-on contract for a second ferry. The first ship, Spirit of Gosport was delivered successfully, but the second, Spirit of Portsmouth was only partially constructed when the customer cancelled the order,however in 2016-17, 'Spirit of Portsmouth' was completed and renamed 'Forth Hope', she has become a medical ferry for Vine Trust in South America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two ships}} of the Calliope sub-class - HMS Calliope and Champion - {{were the last}} pair of the eight [...] "light {{armoured}} cruisers" [...] to be ordered in July and August 1914 under the 1913 Programme. They both had geared turbines, the first Royal Navy cruisers to be so fitted. They also had increased belt armour; Champion had just two screws. They were commissioned in mid to late 1915, as modifications to the Caroline subclass with higher speeds, a more efficient boiler layout {{and a reduction in}} the number of funnels to two. The two ships had different machinery types for comparative purposes. Calliope and Champion underwent similar gun armament modifications to the Caroline subclass. They also had underwater tubes rather than the deck mounted weapons of the Caroline subclass and were given two <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> mounted torpedo tubes during the war but these were later removed to reduce top weight.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Cabinet {{approved}} the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, {{who said that}} new regulations were needed to cater {{for changes in the}} aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes {{in the last few years}} to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). These included Certification of Service Providers; Regulatory Functions; Airworthiness of Aircraft; Licensing; and Flight Operations and Rules of the Air. A transition period of six months from the date of promulgation was provided to allow stakeholders to comply with the amended Regulations.|$|E

5000|$|The bridge {{had been}} built in a {{difficult}} part of the rapids, and its drawspan was {{at an angle to}} the current, making the bridge hard for steamboats to clear. Many felt that the bridge had been intentionally constructed to interfere with steamboat traffic. On May 6, 1856, the steamer Effie Afton collided with the bridge after one of its paddles stopped. The crew were rescued, but the steamer caught fire, damaged the bridge, and sank. Steamboat companies sued to have the bridge dismantled. The M&M and the Rock Island Line hired Abraham Lincoln to defend the bridge. The case worked its way to the Supreme Court and was decided in the bridge's favor in 1862 during the Civil War. In the meantime, the M&M and Rock Island merged to become the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. [...] Durant took his earnings from the M&M merger to form a new company called the Union Pacific Railroad. Lincoln in doing research as private attorney visited M&M facilities and met with various M&M officials in Council Bluffs. When the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 gave Lincoln the power to decide the eastern terminus of the transcontinental he picked a location that was most favorable to his former clients. The case eventually ended in a hung jury, and was dismissed. The US Supreme Court eventually decided a subsequent suit in December 1862, and the bridge remained operational.The first bridge only lasted until 1866, at which time it was considered inadequate for the ever-increasing loads carried by the railroad. It was replaced by a heavier wooden structure that reused the original piers. In turn, this structure was replaced by an iron, <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> bridge in 1872 that carried both a single rail line and a separate roadway. This bridge was at a new location on the western tip of Arsenal Island and the original bridge and rail line was abandoned. The relocation was driven by the federal government, which still owned the island and wished to redevelop it into an arsenal. The original bridge and rail line severed the property in two and this development constraint was removed by relocating the bridge to an extreme end of the island. The federal government jointly used this bridge for access with the railroad, giving rise to the current name - Government Bridge.|$|E
40|$|Long-span bridges are {{flexible}} and therefore {{are sensitive to}} wind induced effects. One way to improve the stability of long span bridges against flutter is to use cross-sections that involve twin side-by-side decks. However, this can amplify responses due to vortex induced oscillations. ^ Wind tunnel testing is a well-established practice to evaluate the stability of bridges against wind loads. In order to study {{the response of the}} prototype in laboratory, dynamic similarity requirements should be satisfied. One of the parameters that is normally violated in wind tunnel testing is Reynolds number. In this dissertation, the effects of Reynolds number on the aerodynamics of a double deck bridge were evaluated by measuring fluctuating forces on a motionless sectional model of a bridge at different wind speeds representing different Reynolds regimes. Also, the efficacy of vortex mitigation devices was evaluated at different Reynolds number regimes. ^ One other parameter that is frequently ignored in wind tunnel studies is the correct simulation of turbulence characteristics. Due to the difficulties in simulating flow with large turbulence length scale on a sectional model, wind tunnel tests are often performed in smooth flow as a conservative approach. The validity of simplifying assumptions in calculation of buffeting loads, as the direct impact of turbulence, needs to be verified for <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> bridges. The effects of turbulence characteristics were investigated by testing sectional models of a <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> bridge under two different turbulent flow conditions. ^ Not only the flow properties play an important role on the aerodynamic response of the bridge, but also the geometry of the cross section shape is expected to have significant effects. In this dissertation, the effects of deck details, such as width of the gap between the twin decks, and traffic barriers on the aerodynamic characteristics of a <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> bridge were investigated, particularly on the vortex shedding forces with the aim of clarifying how these shape details can alter the wind induced responses. ^ Finally, a summary of the issues that are involved in designing a dynamic test rig for high Reynolds number tests is given, using the studied cross section as an example. ...|$|E

This paper analyses different concepts for passenger cabin and cargo hold arrangements, and investigates their potential benefit. Conceptual methods are used to estimate the mass of the pressurized vessel. Three different aerodynamic shapes are being investigated.

40|$|The current {{research}} analyzed the flutter {{response of the}} Stonecutters Cable-Stayed Bridge in Hong Kong, which has a <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> configuration, under the effect of wind. The aerodynamic instability response of the bridge steel deck of the main span is mainly {{the focus of the}} current project. Initially, a complete finite element bridge model was created in ABAQUS finite element software, representing all the structural elements of the Stonecutters Cable-Stayed Bridge in a lumped mass bridge model. The natural frequencies and the vibration modes were validated against the data available in the literature at first. Secondly, the effect of the mean wind loading for wind speeds between 35 m/s and 211 m/s were determined. The vertical and horizontal displacements and the torsional angle at mid-span are indicated to determine the bridge performance under mean wind load. Moreover the flutter instability was modeled based on Scanlan’s theory and the response of the bridge model at several different locations along the main and the side span and the top of the tower, were determined for wind speeds of 35 m/s and higher, where this critical aerodynamic instability is expected to occur. In addition, the responses of the bridge under natural wind data were also determined by applying a wind speed recorded data to the bridge model. Finally, the critical flutter wind speed and the flutter frequency were determined by Fast Fourier Transform in MATLAB program. The flutter onset wind speed was also determined...|$|E
40|$|To {{perform a}} {{realistic}} reliability {{analysis of a}} complex cable-stayed steel footbridge subject to natural hazard and corrosion, this article addresses a rational process of modeling and simulation based on identification, model updating, and validation. In particular, the object {{of this study is}} the Ponte del Mare footbridge located in Pescara, Italy; this bridge was selected as being a complex <b>twin</b> <b>deck</b> curved footbridge because it is prone to corrosion by the aggressive marine environment. With the modeling and simulation objectives in mind, a preliminary finite element (FE) model was realized using the ANSYS software. However, uncertainties in FE modeling and changes during its construction suggested the use of experimental system identification. As a result, the sensor location was supported by a preliminary FE model of the footbridge, although to discriminate close modes of the footbridge and locate identification sensor layouts, Auto Modal Assurance Criterion (AutoMAC) values and stabilization diagram techniques were adopted. Modal characteristics of the footbridge were extracted from signals produced by ambient vibration via the stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm, although similar quantities were identified with free-decay signals produced by impulse excitation using the ERA algorithm. All these procedures were implemented in the Structural Dynamic Identification Toolbox (SDIT) code developed in a MATLAB environment. The discrepancies between analytical and experimental frequencies led to a first update of the FE model based on Powell's dog-leg method that relied on a trust-region approach. As a result, the identified FE model was capable of reproducing the response of the footbridge subject to realistic gravity and wind load conditions. Finally, the FE was further updated in the modal domain, by changing both the stationary aerodynamic coefficients and the flutter derivatives of deck sections {{to take into account the}} effects of the curved deck layou...|$|E
40|$|Stonecutters Bridge of Hong Kong is a {{cable-stayed}} bridge with two single-column pylons each 298 m high and an aerodynamic <b>twin</b> <b>deck.</b> The total {{length of the}} bridge is 1596 m with a main span of 1018 m. The top 118 m of the tower will comprise structural steel and concrete composite while the bottom part will be of reinforced concrete. The bridge deck at the central span will be of steel whilst the side spans will be of concrete. Stonecutters Bridge has adopted a twin-girder deck design with a wide clear separation of 14. 3 m between the two longitudinal girders. Although {{a number of studies}} have been conducted to investigate the aerodynamic performance of twin-girder deck, the actual real life application of this type of deck is extremely limited. This therefore triggered the need for conducting the present studies, the main objective of which is to investigate the performance of Stonecutters Bridge against flutter at its in-service stage as well as during construction. Based on the flutter derivatives obtained from the 1 : 80 scale rigid section model experiment, flutter analysis was carried out using 3 -D finite element based single parameter searching method developed by the second author of this paper. A total of 6 finite element models of the bridge covering the in-service stage as well as 5 construction stages were established. The dynamic characteristics of the bridge associated with these stages were computed and applied in the analyses. Apart from the critical wind speeds for the onset of flutter, the dominant modes of vibration participating in the flutter vibration were also identified. The results indicate that the bridge will be stable against flutter at its in-service stage as well as during construction at wind speeds much higher than the verification wind speed of 95 m/s (1 -minute mean).

40|$|When {{evaluating}} flutter instability, it {{is often}} assumed that incident wind is normal to the longitudinal axis of a bridge and the flutter critical wind speed estimated from this direction is most unfavorable. However, the results obtained in this study via oblique sectional model tests of four typical types of bridge decks show that the lowest flutter critical wind speeds often occur in the yaw wind cases. The four types of bridge decks tested include a flat single-box deck, a flat π-shaped thin-wall <b>deck,</b> a flat <b>twin</b> side-girder <b>deck,</b> and a truss-stiffened deck with and without a narrow central gap. The yaw wind effect could reduce the critical wind speed by about 6 %, 2 %, 8 %, 7 %, respectively, for the above four types of decks within a wind inclination angle range between - 3 ° and 3 °, and the yaw wind angles corresponding to the minimal critical wind speeds are between 4 ° and 15 °. It was {{also found that the}} flutter critical wind speed varies in an undulate manner with the increase of yaw angle, and the variation pattern is largely dependent on both deck shape and wind inclination angle. Therefore, the cosine rule based on the mean wind decomposition is generally inapplicable to the estimation of flutter critical wind speed of long-span bridges under skew winds. The unfavorable effect of yaw wind on the flutter instability of long-span bridges should be taken into consideration seriously in the future practice, especially for supper-long span bridges in strong wind regions.
