Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to work towards it.|$|E
5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding {{the direction of}} its nuclear program, is recruited by the US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal. He becomes {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project, witnesses the tests, and travels to Hiroshima recording the aftermath. Anton regrets the consequences of the atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> with an indoor speed skating rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 Winter Olympics, but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics, had opted for the outdoor L'anneau de vitesse. In its bid, the speed skating events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E

While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who {{was known for his}} cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E

5|$|The risk {{of civil}} {{conflict}} continued, however, and Parliament decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to slight, or damage {{so as to}} put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed {{to the ground in}} the operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E
5|$|Two {{raids on}} Indiana soil {{during the war}} caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and {{southern}} Indiana. The Newburgh Raid on July 18, 1862, occurred when Confederate officer Adam Johnson briefly captured Newburgh by convincing the Union troops garrisoning the town that he had cannon on the surrounding hills, {{when in fact they}} were merely camouflaged stovepipes. The raid convinced the federal government <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids.|$|E

5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E
5|$|Commitment to SS {{ideology}} was emphasized {{throughout the}} recruitment, membership process, and training. Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and were taught <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior. Esoteric rituals and {{the awarding of}} regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology. Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a solstice celebration. Church weddings were replaced with SS Ehewein, a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler. These pseudo-religious rites and ceremonies often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places. In 1933, Himmler bought Wewelsburg, a castle in Westphalia. He initially intended it {{to be used as}} an SS training centre, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to get rid of}} Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conscription}} ran {{contrary to}} British political tradition, but the sheer {{scale of the}} Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers broadcast the news in special editions. While some settlers supported {{the extension of the}} same system to white Southern Rhodesians, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of John Chilembwe's anticolonial uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to move the ship {{farther away from the}} front, {{despite the fact that she}} had only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, after the end of the war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{was forced}} to {{publicly}} defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander {{by a number of}} senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General John Wilton, all of whom had acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E
