2500|$|Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well {{as other}} medieval poems written in Hebrew, {{presents}} some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem [...] "Figs". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: [...] "end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight." [...] The next line of the poem was translated as [...] "And in return, here is my flatus." [...] The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means [...] "vine twig". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that [...] "Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line—'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'—could fit either way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Indeed. And so my plan is {{to think}} of verses in the Bible about Sennacherib and his doings, which {{resemble}} these; this verse, for instance, I remember: [...] "Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah did Sennacherib, King of Assyria, come up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them. And Hezekiah, King of Judah, sent to the King of Assyria to Lachish," [...] and so on. Well, there it actually is, you see. There's Sennacherib, and there's Lachish.

Thackeray’s own small upright handwriting; {{that of his}} daughter, now Mrs. Richmond Ritchie, a rather large round handwriting; and that of an amanuensis whose name I do not know. The interest is mainly this, that it shows that Thackeray dictated a considerable part of the book; and, as Mrs. Ritchie tells me, he dictated it without having previously written anything. The copy was sent straight to press as it stands, with, as you will see, remarkably little alteration. As Esmond is {{generally considered to be}} his most perfect work in point of style, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> remarkable fact and adds considerably to the interest of the MS.” ...|$|E
6000|$|You may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{story of}} disillusionment. When I {{first heard the}} story, I thought so too. But, so far as Dunstone goes, {{that is not the}} case. It is rare that I see him now, but the other day we smoked two cigars apiece together. And in a moment of {{confidence}} he spoke of her. He said how anxious he felt for her health, called her his [...] "Dainty Little Lady," [...] and spoke of the coarseness of other women. I am afraid this is not a very eventful story, and yet there is that----That very convenient gesture, an arm protruded and flickering fingers, conveys my meaning best. Perhaps you will understand.|$|E
6000|$|Now, we have {{obligation}} sufficient thus to do, {{for that}} our Lord loved us, and gave himself for us, to deliver us from death, {{that we might}} live through him. The world, when they hear the doctrine that I have asserted and handled in this little book; to wit, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, will be apt, because themselves are unbelievers, to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> doctrine that leads to looseness, and that gives liberty to the flesh; but if you that believe love your brethren and your neighbours truly, and as you should, you will put to silence the ignorance of such foolish men, and stop their mouths from speaking evil of you. And, I say, let the love of Christ constrain us to this. Who deserveth our heart, our mouth, our life, our goods, so much as Jesus Christ, who has bought us to himself by his blood, to this very end, {{that we should be}} a peculiar people, zealous of good works? ...|$|E

60|$|When {{the good}} man reached the village {{he had no}} need to inquire which was Adam the miller's field, for he saw the crowd {{gathered}} in a rich-looking meadow. As he opened the gate Adam met him, and without ceremony at once accused him of having taken possession of his field. 'Peace, Adam,' said the priest. 'The field hath been taken not by me, but by a higher power, either good or evil--I fear the latter,' and {{he made his way to}} the people. True enough, the foundations were laid as at Whittle, and even the mortar was ready for the masons. 'I am loth to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sorry jest of the Evil One,' said Father Ambrose; 'ye must help me to outwit him, and to give him his labour for his pains. Let each one carry what he can, and, doubtless, Adam will be glad to cart the remainder,'--a proposition the burly miller agreed to at once. Accordingly each of the people walked off with a piece of wood, and Adam started for his team. Before long the field was cleared, and ere sunset the foundations were again laid in the original place, and a goodly piece of wall had been built.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} ten {{o'clock at night}} when I cast myself down upon my bed, and began to gather my {{scattered}} wits, and reflect upon what I had seen and heard. But the more I reflected the less I could make of it. Was I mad, or drunk, or dreaming, or was I merely {{the victim of a}} gigantic and most elaborate hoax? How was it possible that I, a rational man, not unacquainted with the leading scientific facts of our history, and hitherto an absolute and utter disbeliever in all the hocus-pocus which in Europe goes by the name of the supernatural, could believe that I had within the last few minutes been engaged in conversation with a woman two thousand and odd years old? The thing was contrary to the experience of human nature, and absolutely and utterly impossible. It must be a hoax, and yet, if it were a hoax, what was I to make of it? What, too, was to be said of the figures on the water, of the woman's extraordinary acquaintance with the remote past, and her ignorance, or apparent ignorance, of any subsequent history? What, too, of her wonderful and awful loveliness? This, at any rate, was a patent fact, and beyond the experience of the world. No merely mortal woman could shine with such a supernatural radiance. About that she had, at any rate, been in the right--it was not safe for any man to look upon such beauty. I was a hardened vessel in such matters, having, {{with the exception of one}} painful experience of my green and tender youth, put the softer sex (I sometimes <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> misnomer) almost entirely out of my thoughts. But now, to my intense horror, I knew that I could never put away the vision of those glorious eyes; and alas! the very diablerie of the woman, whilst it horrified and repelled, attracted in even a greater degree. A person with the experience of two thousand years at her back, with the command of such tremendous powers, and the knowledge of a mystery that could hold off death, was certainly worth falling in love with, if ever woman was. But, alas! it was not a question of whether or no she was worth it, for so far as I could judge, not being versed in such matters, I, a fellow of my college, noted for what my acquaintances are pleased to call my misogyny, and a respectable man now well on in middle life, had fallen absolutely and hopelessly in love with this white sorceress. Nonsense; it must be nonsense! She had warned me fairly, and I had refused to take the warning. Curses on the fatal curiosity that is ever prompting man to draw the veil from woman, and curses on the natural impulse that begets it! It is the cause of half--ay, and more than half--of our misfortunes. Why cannot man be content to live alone and be happy, and let the women live alone and be happy too? But perhaps they would not be happy, and I am not sure that we should either. Here is a nice state of affairs. I, at my age, to fall a victim to this modern Circe! But then she was not modern, at least she said not. She was almost as ancient as the original Circe.|$|E
