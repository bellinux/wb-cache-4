2500|$|Dieter Bohn of The Verge {{liked the}} new Control Center setup, {{including}} customizable toggles and 3D Touch-expandable options, writing that [...] "there {{are a few}} panels that I'm really impressed with", specifically highlighting the Apple TV remote as a possible replacement of the normal remote. He did, however, note the lack of <b>third-party</b> <b>access</b> to Control Center, with a hope for support in the future, {{and a lack of}} Wi-Fi network selection ability. He praised the screen-recording functionality, calling it [...] "super neat". Bohn severely criticized the notifications view, writing that he has a [...] "very serious disagreement" [...] with Apple on how to manage it, elaborating that he prefers to use that screen as much as possible while stating that [...] "Apple's philosophy is that I'm trying way too hard" [...] to control speedy notifications. Bohn liked the new Files app, new drag-and-drop functionality on the home screen enabling users to drag multiple apps at once, and significantly praised multitasking on iPad. Writing that [...] "Multitasking on the iPad is a near-revelatory experience", he enjoyed the application dock and the ability to place up to three apps on the screen at once with more freedom on placement. Bohn conceded that [...] "It's not as intuitive nor as simple [...] as easy to manipulate as a traditional windowing system like you'll get on a Mac, PC, or Chromebook", but still praised it for being [...] "radically more powerful than what has ever been available on an iPad before". Finally, Bohn praised Siri for improvements to the voice, highlighted augmented reality allowing for [...] "incredible games", and reiterated an earlier sentiment that iOS 11 is [...] "the most ambitious software update from Apple in a very, very long time".|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} reforms on railroad efficiency in Europe by using a new panel data set that covers most EU countries {{over a period of}} more than 20 years.

However, the reform effects depend on sequencing: introduction of multiple reforms in a package has negative effects, while sequential reforms improve efficiency. We also show that our results are robust against potential problems of endogeneity. Copyright (c) The London School of Economics and Political Science 2008. ...|$|R
