50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high pressure (thermo)forming process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8. The process {{is derived from the}} macroscopic <b>trapped</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> process 2. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 Âµm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
40|$|Incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> is a {{cost-effective}} process for rapid manufacturing of sheet metal products. However, incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> {{also has some}} limitations such as severe sheet thinning and long processing time. These limitations hamper the forming part quality and production efficiency, thus restricting the incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> application in industrial practice. To overcome the problem of sheet thinning, a variety of processes, such as multi-step incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming,</b> have been proposed to improve the material flow and thickness distribution. In this work, a new process has been developed by introducing multi-point forming as preforming step before conducting incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> processing. Employing an established hybrid <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> system and the corresponding thickness prediction model, the preform shape can be optimized by employing a two-step optimization approach to improve the sheet thickness distribution. In total, two case study examples, including a hemisphere part and an aerospace cowling part, are fabricated using the developed hybrid flexible process in this study. The experimental {{results show that the}} hybrid flexible forming process with the optimal preform design could achieve sheet parts with more uniform thickness distribution and reduced forming time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a newly developed flexible <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> approach with better sheet thickness distribution and reduced processing time comparing {{to the conventional}} incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming.</b> In the approach, a two-step forming process has been proposed: multi-point forming as preforming is employed to achieve an initial shape and designed thickness distribution; After the preforming, incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> process is then applied to finalize part geometry with desired thickness distribution. In the work, a numerical model for predicting the thickness distribution of the final part is developed by integrating finite element simulation and analytical prediction of ISF process. To achieve the uniformity of final thickness distribution, the preformed shape is optimized based on the developed thickness prediction model. Additionally, a real industrial case problem of forming an aerospace cowling is used to validate the proposed hybrid flexible <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> approach.

40|$|Incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> is a {{versatile}} <b>sheet</b> metal <b>forming</b> process where a <b>sheet</b> metal is <b>formed</b> into its final shape {{by a series}} of localized deformation without a specialised die. However, it still has many shortcomings that need to be overcome such as geometric accuracy, surface roughness, formability, forming speed, and so on. This project focus on minimising the surface roughness of aluminium sheet and improving its thickness uniformity in incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> via optimisation of wall angle, feed rate, and step size. Besides, the effect of wall angle, feed rate, and step size to the surface roughness and thickness uniformity of aluminium sheet was investigated in this project. First of all, part design and tool path generation were done in CATIA software to form the shape of pyramid frustum. Then, the blank holder and the forming tool made of mild steel were fabricated afterwards. Through the selected design of experiments, the incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> experiments were carried out on a 3 -axis CNC milling machine. From the results, it was observed that surface roughness and thickness uniformity were inversely varied due to the formation of surface waviness. Increase in feed rate and decrease in step size will produce a lower surface roughness, while uniform thickness reduction was obtained by reducing the wall angle and step size. By using Taguchi analysis, the optimum parameters for minimum surface roughness and uniform thickness reduction of aluminium sheet were determined. Meanwhile, analysis of variance concluded that step size is the most significant parameter to both the surface roughness and thickness uniformity of aluminium sheet in incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming.</b> The finding of this project helps to reduce the time in optimising the surface roughness and thickness uniformity in incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming...</b>|$|R

40|$|A strain-based forming limit {{criterion}} {{is widely}} used in sheet-metal forming industry to predict necking. However, this criterion is usually valid when the strain path is linear throughout the deformation process [1]. Strain path in incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming</b> is often found to be severely nonlinear throughout the deformation history. Therefore, the practice of using a strain-based forming limit criterion often leads to erroneous assessments of formability and failure prediction. On the other hands, stress-based forming limit is insensitive against any changes in the strain path and hence it is first used to model the necking limit in incremental <b>sheet</b> <b>forming.</b> The stress-based forming limit is also combined with the fracture limit based on {{maximum shear stress criterion}} to show necking and fracture together. A derivation for a general mapping method from strain-based FLC to stress-based FLC using a non-quadratic yield function has been made. Simulation model is evaluated for a single point incremental forming using AA 6022 -T 43, and checked the accuracy against experiments.
