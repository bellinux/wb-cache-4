5|$|Van der Sloot (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, Natalee Holloway, who was declared legally dead six years after she disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van der Sloot remained in custody. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van Der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the results of the investigation. On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidence</b> to solve the case.|$|E

Judicial and police organs do not express any eagerness <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidence</b> about the homophobic motives of those who perpetrate crimes. Judges are not obliged to consider such motives as aggravating the circumstances of guilt, or to impose more severe punishments when homophobic motives are present.

25|$|Following her civil trial, Hutchinson needed also {{to face a}} {{trial by}} the clergy, and this could not take place until the {{following}} March. In the interim, she {{was not allowed to}} return home, but instead was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld, which was located in Roxbury, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, yet she was rarely able to see her children because of the winter weather, which was particularly harsh that year. She was frequently visited by the various ministers; modern writer Eve LaPlante claims that they came with the intention of reforming her thinking and also <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidence</b> to use against her in the forthcoming church trial.

25|$|In February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay {{issued a}} {{circular}} {{letter to the}} other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance.

Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop Liberty, owned by John Hancock, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the Treason Act 1543 which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England.

50|$|For {{a number}} of reasons, the Purépecha origins are {{shrouded}} in mystery. Much of Purépecha culture is very distinct from other Mesoamerican cultures. The Purépecha language has {{more in common with}} Zuni in the southwest U.S. and Quechua in Peru and is unrelated to any other Mesoamerican language. Jeromimo de Acalá’s collection of stories from Purépecha elders states that these people migrated to the Lake Pátzcuaro region, developing alliances among the people who were already here. Eventually, they became the dominant group and established their city at Tzintzuntzan. According <b>to</b> <b>collected</b> <b>evidence,</b> the Purépecha people may have begun to dominate the Pátzcuaro Lake area as early as 1000 C.E., but definitely by 1250.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidences</b> on the role of {{transglutaminase}} (TG, E.

Treatment of melanoma cells with nimesulide produces a considerable reduction of cell proliferation, paralleled by a remarkable decrease of the intracellular concentration of polyamines spermidine and spermine. NMS treatment induces cancer cell differentiation, likely through the observed enhancement of TG and tyrosinase activities and increase of melanin production, well known markers of melanocyte differentiation. The overall results highlight the possibility that nimesulide acts as antineoplastic agent likely through the induction of intracellular TG activity...|$|R

500|$|Identifying deaths {{specifically}} {{attributable to}} the Berlin Wall is not straightforward. Although East Germans were aware of deaths on the Wall from West German media broadcasts which {{they were able to}} receive, reliable information was closely held by the East German authorities. A number of different West German institutions kept their own records. These included the West Berlin police, the Central Registry of State Judicial Administration in Salzgitter (which tracked all border fatalities) and the Arbeitsgruppe 13 August (Working Group 13 August), a West Berlin association. Within the jurisdiction of the West-Berlin police, the State Security Department was responsible for the registration of known incidents. The records distinguish between individuals who died at the outer border of West-Berlin (80 incidents), unclear incidents (with 5 possible wall victims) and border guards who were shot. The Central Registry of State Judicial Administrations in Salzgitter, was also given a mandate <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidence</b> of actual or attempted murder in the GDR. In 1991, it published the [...] "Salzgitter-Report" [...] with the names of 78 victims. However, since the Registration Agency had no access to the GDR archives, the data was regarded as incomplete. Both agencies mainly listed incidents that could have been observed from West-Berlin or had been reported by fugitives or border patrols who left the GDR.|$|E

Zenigata wants <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>evidence,</b> but Lupin points out they must escape the castle first. They start a fire as a distraction and steal the Count's autogyro. However, as they attempt to rescue Clarisse, Lupin is shot. Clarisse offers the ring to the Count in exchange for Lupin's life. [...] After securing the ring, the Count's attempt at betrayal is foiled when Fujiko's actions allow her, Lupin, and Zenigata to flee. As Lupin recovers from his injuries, Zenigata attempts to convince his superiors at Interpol to prosecute the Count for counterfeiting, but fearing political repercussions, they halt the investigation and remove him from the case. Meanwhile, Lupin intends to stop the wedding and rescue the princess. He also reveals his reasons for rescuing Clarisse to Jigen, Goemon and her family's former gardener — as a young girl, she had saved his life during his unsuccessful first attempt to find the source of the counterfeit bills ten years earlier. Fujiko tips off Lupin on a way to sneak into the castle, and forms a plan with Zenigata to publicly reveal the counterfeiting operation under the cover of pursuing Lupin.|$|E
