25|$|Podophyllotoxin is an antineoplastic lignan {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the American Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum or Podophyllum emodi).

25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata.

40|$|Background: Although the {{incidence}} of glioma is relatively low, {{it is the most}} malignant tumor of the central nervous system. The prognosis of high-grade glioma patient is very poor due to the difficulties in complete resection and resistance to radio-/chemotherapy. Therefore, it is worth investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in glioma drug resistance. MicroRNAs have been found to play important roles in tumor progression and drug resistance. Our previous work showed that miR- 181 b is involved in the regulation of temozolomide resistance. In the current study, we investigated whether miR- 181 b also plays a role in antagonizing the effect of <b>teniposide.</b> Methods: MiR- 181 b expression was measured in 90 glioma patient tissues and its relationship to prognosis of these patients was analyzed. Cell sensitivity to <b>teniposide</b> was tested in 48 primary cultured glioma samples. Then miR- 181 b stably overexpressed U 87 cells were generated. The candidate genes of miR- 181 b from our previous study were reanalyzed, and the interaction between miR- 181 b and target gene MDM 2 was confirmed by dual luciferase assay. Cell sensitivity to <b>teniposide</b> was detected on miR- 181 b over expressed and MDM 2 down regulated cells. Results: Our data confirmed the low expression levels of miR- 181 b in high-grade glioma tissues, which is related to <b>teniposide</b> resistance in primary cultured glioma cells. Overexpression of miR- 181 b increased glioma cell sensitivity to <b>teniposide.</b> Through target gene prediction, we found that MDM 2 is a candidate target of miR- 181 b. MDM 2 knockdown mimicked the sensitization effect of miR- 181 b. Further study revealed that miR- 181 b binds to the 3 '-UTR region of MDM 2 leading to the decrease in MDM 2 levels and subsequent increase in <b>teniposide</b> sensitivity. Partial restoration of MDM 2 attenuated the sensitivity enhancement by miR- 181 b. Conclusions: MiR- 181 b is an important positive regulator on glioma cell sensitivity to <b>teniposide.</b> It confers glioma cell sensitivity to <b>teniposide</b> through binding to the 3 '-UTR region of MDM 2 leading to its reduced expression. Our findings not only reveal the novel mechanism involved in <b>teniposide</b> resistance, but also shed light on the optimization of glioma treatment in the future.

Using a panel of prototypical substrates and inhibitors for specific cytochromes P 450, we identified sub-strates for CYP 3 A 4 (midazolam, erythromycin, cyclosporin, and dexamethasone) as inhibitors of catechol formation from both etoposide and <b>teniposide.</b> Dexamethasone inhibition was com-petitive, with K 1 values of 60 and 45 MM for etoposide and <b>teniposide,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of the present study}} was to answer the question whether the catalytic topoisomerase-II inhibitor, dexrazoxane, can be used as a modulator of teniposide-induced DNA damage and programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the bone marrow cells in vivo. The alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis, scoring of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and mitotic activity were undertaken in the current study as markers of DNA damage. Apoptosis was analysed by the occurrence of a hypodiploid DNA peak and caspase- 3 activity. Oxidative stress marker such as intracellular reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidised glutathione were assessed in bone marrow as a possible mechanism underlying this amelioration. Dexrazoxane was neither genotoxic nor apoptogenic in mice at the tested dose. Moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that dexrazoxane affords significant protection against teniposide-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in the bone marrow cells in vivo and effectively suppresses the apoptotic signalling triggered by <b>teniposide.</b> <b>Teniposide</b> induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative stress including accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, enhanced lipid peroxidation, accumulation of oxidised glutathione and reduction in the reduced glutathione level. Prior administration of dexrazoxane ahead of <b>teniposide</b> challenge ameliorated these biochemical alterations. It is thus concluded that pretreatment with dexrazoxane attenuates teniposide-induced oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage and apoptosis in bone marrow cells. Based on our data presented, strategies can be developed to decrease the teniposide-induced DNA damage in normal cells using dexrazoxane. Therefore, dexrazoxane can be a good candidate to decrease the deleterious effects of <b>teniposide</b> in the bone marrow cells of cancer patients treated with <b>teniposide...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Approximately 60 % of {{patients}} with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop brain metastases, Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) gives symptomatic improvement in more than 50 % of these patients. Because brain metastases are a sign of systemic progression, and chemotherapy {{was found to be}} effective as well, ir becomes questionable whether WBRT is the only appropriate therapy in this situation. Patients and Methods: In a phase III study, SCLC patients with brain metastases were randomized to receive <b>teniposide</b> with or without WBRT. <b>Teniposide</b> 120 mg/m(2) wets given intravenously three rimes a week, every 3 weeks. WBRT(10 fractions of 3 Gy) had to start within 3 weeks from the start of chemotherapy. Response was measured clinically and by computed tomography of the brain. Results: One hundred twenty eligible patients were randomized.
