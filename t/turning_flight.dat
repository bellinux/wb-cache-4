Moreover, the dynamic stall phenomenon which occur during such flight condition lead to very high torsion moments, and therefore to huge loads in the whole control path. Hence, {{the purpose of this}} Master Thesis is to improve the dynamic stall phenomenon simulation, investigating how the existing dynamic stall models can be improved for the blade loads prediction in helicopter simulation. The approach to use for this purpose should be to compare the simulation with flight test and Gensim's results, adjusting dynamic stall model to improve the blade loads prediction. Furthermore, it could be useful to investigate the behaviour of the dynamically corrected polar in combination with the static and the dynamic stall setting...|$|R

50|$|In <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> {{the load}} factor is {{normally}} greater than +1. For example, in a turn with a 60° angle of bank the load factor is +2. Again, {{if the same}} turn is performed with the aircraft inverted, the load factor becomes -2. In general, in a balanced turn in which the angle of bank is θ, the load factor n {{is related to the}} cosine of θ by the formula: Another way to achieve load factors significantly higher than +1 is to pull on the elevator control {{at the bottom of a}} dive, whereas strongly pushing the stick forward during straight and level flight is likely to produce negative load factors, by causing the lift to act in the opposite direction to normal, i.e. downwards.|$|E

50|$|To turn, an {{aircraft}} must {{roll in the}} direction of the turn, increasing the aircraft's bank angle. <b>Turning</b> <b>flight</b> lowers the wing's lift component against gravity and hence causes a descent. To compensate, the lift force must be increased by increasing the angle of attack by use of up elevator deflection which increases drag. Turning can be described as 'climbing around a circle' (wing lift is diverted to turning the aircraft) so the increase in wing angle of attack creates even more drag. The tighter the turn radius attempted, the more drag induced, this requires that power (thrust) be added to overcome the drag. The maximum rate of turn possible for a given aircraft design is limited by its wing size and available engine power: the maximum turn the aircraft can achieve and hold is its sustained turn performance. As the bank angle increases so does the g-force applied to the aircraft, this having the effect of increasing the wing loading and also the stalling speed. This effect is also experienced during level pitching maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new method of characterizing the external noise radiation {{of a helicopter}} suitable {{for use in the}} generation of ground noise contours for community land use planning and assessing the acoustic observability of helicopter flight plans. This work is an extension of the semi-empirical Rotorcraft Noise Model / Quasi-Static Acoustic Mapping (RNM/Q-SAM) methodology of characterizing helicopter externally radiated noise using acoustic radiation hemispheres. Current methods of interpolation of data on RNM acoustic radiation spheres are found to lead to high levels of inaccuracy when using sparse microphone arrays. A new method of interpolation based on the theory of radial basis functions is developed in this thesis and shown to lead to significantly improved accuracy. This thesis also extends the RNM/Q-SAM methodology to <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> conditions. New test procedures are developed for steady <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> conditions and then used in the acoustic flight testing of the Bell 206 B helicopter. The extended RNM/Q-SAM method is applied to the resulting data set in order to generate the first acoustic radiation hemispheres for a helicopter in steady <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> across a range of flight path angles. The results indicate that the extended Quasi-Static Acoustic Mapping technique is valid for steady <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> Blade-Vortex Interaction noise. Furthermore, steady <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> alone is shown not to lead to large increases in externally radiated noise compared to similar straight-line flight conditions. This indicates that high BVI noise levels reported during turns in prior research were most likely caused by transient maneuvers and not <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> alone...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a theoretical study of the flight dynamics and han-dling qualities of hingeless rotor helicopters in <b>turning</b> <b>flight.</b> Frequency responses in pitch, roll, and heave are evaluated for various advance ratios, turn rates, and turn directions; comparisons are made with criteria of the ADS- 33 handling qualities specifications. The results show that couplings between lateral and longitudinal dynamics are present in turn-ing flight. Flight speed, load factor, and direction of turn affect frequency and damping of both poles and zeros. Zeros that are stable in straight flight can become lowly damped or nonminimum-phase and cause a deterioration of handling qualities. This may also cause flight control systems designed for straight flight to perform poorly in some <b>turning</b> <b>flight</b> conditions. The bandwidth criteria of the ADS- 33 specifications do not explicitly address maneuvering flight conditions. Therefore, there remains an open question of whether the degradations of handling qualities identified in this study are real (possibly through mech-anisms other than those intended in the original formulation of the specification) or are a mathematical artifact...|$|E
