40|$|AbstractSo far, traffic {{assignment}} {{to a network}} has been modelled by aggregating <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> into zone centroids. The paper introduces a disaggregate model of <b>trip</b> <b>ends,</b> by associating to each zone a set of “anchor nodes” for network access and a random vector of terminal costs’ (or time) between <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> and zonal anchors. These can be specified by OD pair. Assuming that terminal costs and network costs are independent, the system assignment can be performed in two stages, respectively network and terminal. A probit model based on Clark's formulas is recommended. A computation scheme is provided that loads OD flows by anchor pair onto the network in an efficient way. A binary case is addressed as illustration. Also reported is an application to the roadway network of the Paris area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Since {{primary school}} trips usually start from home, {{attention}} by many scholars have {{been focused on}} the home end for data gathering. Thereafter category analysis has often been relied upon when predicting school travel demands. In this paper, school end was relied on for data gathering and multivariate regression for future travel demand prediction. 9859 pupils were surveyed by way of questionnaires at 21 primary schools. The town was divided into 5 zones. The study was carried out in Skudai Town, Malaysia. Based on the hypothesis that the number of primary school <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> are expected to be the same because school trips are fixed, the choice of <b>trip</b> <b>end</b> would have inconsequential effect on the outcome. The study compared empirical data for home and school <b>trip</b> <b>end</b> productions and attractions. Variance from both data results was insignificant, although some claims from home based family survey were found to be grossly exaggerated. Data from the school <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> was relied on for travel demand prediction because of its completeness. Accessibility, trip attraction and trip production were then related to school trip rates under daylight and dry weather conditions. The paper concluded that, accessibility is an important parameter when predicting demand for future school trip rates.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to capture vehicle location, it is now feasible to easily collect multiple days of travel data automatically. However, GPS-collected data are not ready for direct use in trip rate or route choice research until <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> are identified within large GPS data streams. One common parameter used to divide trips is dwell time, the time a vehicle is stationary. Identifying trips is particularly challenging when there is trip chaining with brief stops, such as picking up and dropping off passengers. It is hard to distinguish these stops from those caused by traffic controls or congestion. Although the dwell time method is effective in many cases, it is not foolproof and recent research indicates use of additional logic improves trip dividing. While some studies incorporating more than dwell time to identify <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> having been conducted, research including actual <b>trip</b> <b>ends</b> to evaluate the success of trip dividing methods used have been limited. In this research, 12 ten-day real-world GPS travel datasets were used to develop, calibrate and compare three methods to identify trip start points in the data stream. The true start and end points of each trip were identified in advance in the GPS data stream using a supplemental trip log completed by the participants so that the accuracy of each automated trip division method could be measured and compared. A heuristic model, which combines heading change, dwell time and distance between the GPS points and the road network, performs best, correctly identifying 94 % of <b>trip</b> <b>ends.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Direct demand {{models have}} been {{developed}} based on ticket sales data for 85 local rail stations in South Wales. Initially log-linear regression models were calibrated, incorporating a variety of independent variables. Geographical Information Systems were used to implement flexible station catchment definition methods, notably flow-specific catchments where population units were allocated to stations by minimising the total travel time to individual destinations. To validate these methods a survey of ultimate <b>trip</b> <b>end</b> locations was carried out on the Rhymney line in South Wales. To give consistency with predictions from <b>trip</b> <b>end</b> models, methods were developed to constrain predicted trip numbers for each flow based on the total trips observed or predicted from origin stations. Simple scaling had only limited success, so probabilistic trip distribution models were calibrated by using both the linear and non-linear regression.
