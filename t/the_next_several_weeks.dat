The game debuted {{at the top of}} Media Create's sales charts, selling 213,579 copies during its first week. The release was also noted to have helped boost the sales of the Nintendo 3DS console. Although the amount of pre-orders surpassed that of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days for the Nintendo DS, the first week's sales were lower. Nevertheless, Media Create noted that this was due to the {{comparison}} between the amount of units sold between the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo 3DS during the time the games were released, with the former having sold more copies than the latter.

By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>weeks,</b> Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops.

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 A {{catalytic}} gas process compressor experienced {{low frequency}} vibrations {{in excess of}} trip levels following installation of a honeycomb balance piston. After 12 years of operation, low seal oil differential forced an unplanned unit shutdown. The source was identified as caustic corrosion of the aluminum balance piston. A stainless steel (SS) honeycomb seal was installed {{in place of the}} aluminum labyrinth seal. During <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two <b>weeks,</b> <b>several</b> trips of the compressor train were experienced caused by high levels of subsynchronous vibrations. Ties of the vibration problem to process conditions were studied and tested. Rotordynamic analysis identified the combination of damper bearing and honeycomb balance piston seal as the source of the low frequency vibrations. This paper describes the operating history of compressor, the vibration data recorded during a vibration event, teardown inspection results, and the subsequent rotordynamic analysis. The combination of low support stiffness with negative honeycomb stiffness lowered the frequency of the first natural frequency to a point that the honeycomb seal became destabilizing. To minimize unplanned capacity loss of the unit, an aluminum labyrinth seal was reinstalled, the caustic source corrected, and the unit restarted. The high levels of low frequency vibration have been eliminated and the unit has operated without vibration incidents for over 12 months...|$|R

The protests also involved turning loose several white mice at the event, which Fair attendees began scooping up off the ground.

We describe a case of local transmission in Canada and review tools available for confi rming a diagnosis. Improved molecular tools and global clinical awareness are needed to recognize cases of endemic syphilis imported to areas where it is not normally seen. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum is the causative agent of endemic syphilis, also called nonvenereal syphilis. Other diseases caused by nonvenereal treponematoses are yaws (T. pallidum subsp. pertenue) and pinta (T. carateum). The 3 diseases are a substantial cause of illness in the nonindustrialized world, but they are rarely encountered in industrialized areas. Endemic syphilis is encountered in dry, hot regions, including Sahelian areas of western Africa and parts of Botswana, Zimbabwe, and the Arabian Peninsula (1 – 4). The causative organism is transmitted by direct contact with secretions from lesions or on fomites. The clinical spectrum of these diseases involves various degrees of involvement of the skin, mucous membranes, and skeletal system, depending on the organism (1, 2, 5, 6). The Study In February 2011, a 1 -year-old girl was referred to our infectious diseases clinic for assessment of skin lesions.

Mali staunchly claimed that city {{had nothing to do with}} the incident, but his other original reactions were bewildering. Constantly asked by the reporters how is he not interested into the security of his own citizens due to his obvious detached attitude towards the incident, he responded that, since no one actually knows what happened, he feels secure and that he didn't inquire on anything about it (for example, the police, which was called by the neighbors and bystanders during the incident refused to come to scene) cause it is not his job. However, two weeks after the incident, prime minister Vučić stated that those who demolished the buildings by night are [...] "complete idiots" [...] and they should demolish them by day, in which case he would help them personally.
