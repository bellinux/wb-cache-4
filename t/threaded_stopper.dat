Mrs. Ladd purchased second-hand bottles from dealers ("marine store collectors") and instructed her bottle-washers and fillers to use all bottles, no matter what the brand. This was against the rules of the Aerated Waters and Cordial Makers' Employés' Union, (It was some 20 years before the manufacturers had a similar agreement) and the men refused to do so, and threatened strike action if forced to disobey Union Rules. Mrs. Ladd's motives were financial: she purchased secondhand bottles for 8d. per dozen, whereas new bottles cost 36s. per gross (3s. per dozen). In today's money that would be around $5.00 v. $22.00 per dozen.|$|E

Wherein the piezoelectric stator is made base, the composite type actuating element and stator formed. As the composite type actuating element is set by the axial vibration type actuating element, horizontal bending vibration type actuating element and vertical bending vibration type actuating element formed. The stator is an empty cylinder with a waist and tapered hole. In addition, the rotor {{is a kind of}} a hollow cone. It can be through the preload adjusting module to withstand the stator. As the preload adjusting module is set by the limit element, spring, washer and nut formed. While the shaft is a kind of cylinder with screw <b>thread</b> and <b>stopper,</b> it can pass through the piezoelectric stator, rotor and the preload adjusting module, making it a composite type piezoelectric motor. When we provide appropriate driving voltage, frequency, loading and phase angle to the piezoelectric stator, we can let the piezoelectric motor produces rapid rotation. Of course, we can also change through the driving phase angle, to change the direction of rotation of the piezoelectric motor. According to the experimental results, we found that its maximum speed and loading are 480 rpm and 2305 gw under conditions of 180 V p-p, 35 kHz and 0 0 driving phase angle. Most importantly, we also found that the composite type piezoelectric motor has a very good conversion efficiency of the driving phase angle. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscience and {{nanotechnology}} are new {{fields of}} science and technology that deal with the study and control of matter on the nanometre range. One of their main challenges is the manipulation of single atoms and molecules to build up devices and machines of nanometre size that could accomplish tasks with effects visible in a macroscopic scale. Devices and machines of nanometre size are, in principle, defined by analogy with their macroscopic counterparts. A ‘molecular device’ is an assembly of a discrete number of molecular components designed to achieve a specific function and a ‘molecular machine’ is a particular type of molecular device, in which the component parts can display changes in their relative positions as result of some external stimuli to perform a net task. In this thesis we studied some examples of synthetic molecules that seem suitable candidates for developing molecular devices, specifically rotaxanes and a dithienylethene-based switch. Rotaxanes are molecular shuttles composed of one or more macrocyclic structures locked onto a linear <b>thread</b> by bulky <b>stoppers</b> placed at both ends. The macrocyclic structure can shuttle along the thread, allowing a translational or positional isomerism, which infers the switching of macroscopic material properties through controlled motion (shuttling) at the molecular level. On the other hand, dithienylethene-based molecules can exist in two stable configurations, the so-called open and closed forms that have very different electronic properties, and it is possible to switch between them by irradiation with light of a particular wavelength. These examples have been extensively studied in solution. However, for most foreseeable nanotechnological applications they have to be integrated in the solid state, to be used as building blocks for the preparation of functional and addressable materials. The approach followed in this thesis is to immobilize them on a surface and study them in the form of monolayers or thin films. ...|$|R

Binding constants (Ka) for all of these 1 : 1 complexes, which were determined both (1) by isothermal titration calorimetry in MeCN solution and (2) by the 1 H NMR spectroscopic single-point method in CD 3 CN solution, were found to be, on the average, an order of magnitude less than the Ka values obtained for DB 24 C 8 and DP 24 C 8 with dibenzylammonium (DBA+) hexafluorophosphate {{and three of}} its derivatives, also disubstituted at the para positions of the benzyl groups with CO 2 Me, F and Me. In the case of BMP 25 C 8, however, the Ka values with both categories (BIPY 2 + and DBA+) of guests are much of a muchness, being both small and error prone. The equilibrium thermodynamics for these small libraries of [2]pseudorotaxanes indicate that the best bistable [2]rotaxanes incorporating both DBA+ and BIPY 2 + recognition sites are going to involve ester functions in their dumbbell components and will employ DP 24 C 8 or, failing that, DB 24 C 8 as the ring component.

40|$|Traditionally, dendrimeric and {{polymeric}} macromolecules {{have been}} pieced together using {{the strength of}} covalent and metal coordinative bonds. The incorporation of non-covalent interactions within these polymers may prove interesting in the fundamental role that interlocked components play in entanglements, rheology, elasticity and mechanical properties of the polymers in which they will be incorporated. The focus of this thesis is to explore the incorporation of the 1, 2 -bis(pyridinium) ethane (Loeb) rotaxane motif into various polymeric and dendrimeric architectures and study how these new interpenetrated and interlocked components affect {{the properties of the}} resulting systems. A series of molecules possessing both recognition elements covalently bound to one another, in a daisy chain fashion, were synthesized in order to study their self-complexing and oligomerizing abilities in competitive and non-competitive solvents. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy and high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were used to characterize these compounds and study their polymerization behavior. The same rotaxane motif was then used to synthesize a series of branched [n]rotaxanes. [2]-, [3]- and [4]Rotaxanes were obtained using a <b>threading</b> followed by <b>stoppering</b> approach and subsequently characterized by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. Isolated product yields and product distributions are discussed with respect to the core size and macrocyclic arrangement about the core. To study the effect of incorporating Frechet dendrons as stoppers and as macrocyclic appendages into this rotaxane motif, various dendrimeric [2]rotaxanes were synthesized. By altering the size of the dendrons employed, a 1 H NMR spectroscopic study was performed in a variety of solvents of differing polarity. Their results as well as ESI-MS investigations will be discussed. Finally, Frechet dendrons were incorporated into a series of [3]rotaxanes and their [2]rotaxane molecular shuttle counterparts. This was done in order to study the effect dendrons have on the translational isomerism of shuttling [2]rotaxane systems. The systems were characterized by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. In addition, the rates of the shuttling process as well as the recognition site occupancy were measured using variable temperature NMR (VT-NMR) spectroscopy as well as NMR simulation software.

40|$|Electronic version {{does not}} contain {{associated}} previously published materialThis thesis reveals the strategies for the construction and replication of mechanically interlocked molecules, particularly rotaxanes, which consist of a macrocyclic ring that encircles a linear component terminated with bulky groups. The work highlights our recent research activities in exploring the recognition-mediated synthesis of this class of interlocked molecule and its amplification by replication. Our starting point is the minimal model of self-replication. The introductory chapters (Chapter 1 and 2) provide some background and significance to the study, which presents comprehensive review of the published work {{carried out in the}} area of self-replication with existing examples from biomimetic and discrete synthetic assemblies. In Chapter 1, we mainly discuss the do and the donʼts in designing successful self-replicating systems based on our own experience in previous work. Our chief concerns in Chapter 2 are the understanding of the chemistry of the mechanical bond and the synthesis of rotaxanes by three means of approaches (clipping, <b>threading</b> and <b>stoppering,</b> and slippage). Attractive and useful examples are illustrated for each mechanism. Moreover, the definition and the roles of templated-synthesis of interlocked molecules are described. Recent advances in the {{understanding of the nature of}} the mechanical bond have also been introduced into molecular electronic devices. Emphasis is placed in Chapter 3 upon the essential requirements for the design of self-replicating rotaxanes, namely a recognition site, a reactive site and a binding site. These aspects are explained in the designed minimal model chosen in the past (Replication model 1) and the alternate proposed models (Replication model 2 and Replication model 3). The importance of high association constant to provide substantial amount of pseudorotaxane [L•M] precursors is exemplified in the simple kinetic model of rotaxane formation. The advantages and disadvantages of each independent minimal replication model are also summarized. In the self-replicating rotaxane frameworks, the principal strategy involves a selection of an efficient macrocycle to accommodate the guest unit. Thus, Chapter 4 exclusively describes the design, synthesis and binding properties of a series of macrocycle incorporating the hydrogen bond donors and/or hydrogen bond acceptors motif. In particular, the guests were designed and synthesised based on the mutual interactions with the macrocycle framework and the binding experiments is described in details. An account is provided of the problems faced in the synthetic attempts towards the formation of these macrocycles. The novel macrocycle MEU demonstrated a deficient binding performance with amide and urea compounds, and thus abandoned in later stages. The developed macrocycle MDG and MP have been selected as our workhorse macrocycles, which successfully increase the binding strength in the pseudorotaxanes formation. We have learnt that the association constant, Kₐ can be manipulated by the changing the binding site of the guest or redesign the framework of the macrocycle itself. An exhaustive investigation of the performance of self-replicating rotaxanes focuses on Replication model 1 is demonstrated in Chapter 5. It was evident now that as a consequence of low Kₐ, a substantial amount of thread is present over rotaxane. The implementation of the simple kinetic model of rotaxane formation is prevailed through out this chapter. The position of the central reversible equilibrium in this model effectively resulted in a different reactivity of thread and rotaxane. Therefore, it is concluded that the ratio of rotaxane and thread is sensitive to both the association constant for the [L•M] complex and to the ratio of k[subscript(rotaxane) ]/k[subscript(thread) ]. The key marker for the efficiency of the rotaxane-forming protocol is the ratio of rotaxane, R to thread, T. In previous chapter, the Kₐ for the [L•M] complex was around 100 M⁻¹ and k[subscript(T) ] = 3 k[subscript(R) ], which led to an unacceptably small [R]/[T] ratio. We demonstrated for the first time in Chapter 6, that it is possible to manipulate the Kₐ for the [L•M] complex by means of a change in temperature. Yields of a rotaxane can be improved by employing a two-step capture protocol. Cooling a solution of the linear and macrocyclic components required for the rotaxane increases the population of the target pseudorotaxane, which is then captured by a rapid capping reaction between an azide and PPh₃. The resulting iminophosphorane rotaxane can then be manipulated synthetically at elevated temperatures. Following this, these imines could be reduced readily to afford the stable amine rotaxane. Replication model 2 is subsequently proposed as alternate replication framework in Chapter 7, which realised significant advantages over the first model. A number of designs of a potential self-replicating rotaxane have been fabricated in order to integrate self-replication with the formation of rotaxanes. An account is provided of the problems faced with the unanticipated larger cavity of the newly prepared acid recognition macrocycles, and hence, force us to search for a new scaffold of the nitrone structures. Pleasingly, a substantial amount of rotaxane was present, mostly as trans diastereoisomer. It is concluded that the resulting rotaxane structures may be self-replicating through the recognition-mediated pathways from the preliminary kinetic experiments. Nonetheless, the remainder of the full kinetic analysis are prevented given a small quantity of the necessary building block. Chapter 8 reveals our recent efforts to demonstrate the notions behind the final replication scheme, Replication model 3. We have become aware that the reactive site must be placed sufficiently far away from the binding site to inhibit the remote steric effect through the proximity of the macrocyclic component. The design of novel nitrone structures is described in details. We bring together conclusions that can be drawn from three designated replication models in Chapter 9. Experimental and synthetic procedures of the target compounds and appropriate spectroscopic analysis of the products are elaborated in Chapter 10...|$|R
