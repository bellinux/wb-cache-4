25|$|Zillions of Games is a {{commercial}} general game playing system developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler in 1998. The game rules are specified with S-expressions, Zillions rule language. It {{was designed to}} handle mostly abstract strategy board games or puzzles.

25|$|A {{problem is}} {{regarded}} as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them,</b> such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such {{as the amount of}} communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.|$|E

25|$|The traffic {{problems}} that had blighted Potsdamer Platz for decades {{continued to be}} a big headache, despite the new lights, and these led to a strong desire <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them</b> once and for all. By now Berlin was a major centre of innovation in many different fields including architecture. In addition, the city’s colossal pace of change (compared by some to that of Chicago), had caused its chief planner, Martin Wagner (1885–1957), to foresee the entire centre being made over totally as often as every 25 years. These factors combined to produce some far more radical and futuristic plans for Potsdamer Platz in the late 1920s and early 1930s, especially around 1928-9, when the creative fervour was at its peak. On the cards was an almost total redevelopment of the area. One design submitted by Wagner himself comprised an array of gleaming new buildings arranged around a vast multi-level system of fly-overs and underpasses, with a huge glass-roofed circular car-park in the middle. Unfortunately the worldwide Great Depression of the time, triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, meant that most of the plans remained on the drawing board. However, in Germany this depression was virtually a continuation of an economic morass that had blighted the country since the end of World War I, partly the result of the war reparations the country had been made to pay, and this morass had brought about the closure and demolition of the Grand Hotel Belle Vue, on the corner of Bellevuestraße and Königgrätzer Straße, thus enabling one revolutionary new building to struggle through to reality despite considerable financial odds.|$|E

500|$|Blow {{recognized}} that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, {{and did not have}} any set difficulty curve. He designed most of the game's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles, allowing them to experience the rest of the game even if they could not solve a difficult puzzle. Only certain boss fights require the player to defeat the enemy character before continuing on, using a combination of the time mechanics. Blow hoped that players would be able to find solutions to puzzles they had skipped by completing puzzles later in the game. Blow felt that [...] "unearned rewards are false and meaningless", and thus included collectibles earned only after solving a puzzle. He strongly discouraged players from using a walkthrough to work their way through Braid, instead encouraging players <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them</b> on their own so that they [...] "will feel very good about" [...] completing the puzzles without help; Blow created his own official [...] "walkthrough" [...] that guides the player but instead restates his insistence that the player work through the puzzles on their own. Some puzzles pay homage to other video games; one level features a Donkey Kong-inspired puzzle, and the ending of most worlds tells the player that [...] "the princess is in another castle", similar to the end of each world in Super Mario Bros.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{a message}} {{recorded}} by Ojeda Ríos was {{played at the}} commemoration of the Cry of Lares. In it he rememorated {{the creation of the}} Junta Republicana de Cuba y Puerto Rico, which was established in a reunion held at New York and which served to plan this event and its counterpart, the Cry of Yara. Tracing the origin of the local independence movement to several events that preceded this insurrection, Ojeda Ríos discussed the various individuals that had led the armed organizations throughout history, while also noting simulates in the working eviroment of the 1860s and the 1950s. He later discussed the existence of reformists within the independence movement, citing that they unwittingly [...] "helped consolidate the current colonial status" [...] citing a then-independentist Luis Muñoz Marín as the leader of this movement. Ojeda Ríos also cited his belief that the establishment of the Commonwealth had [...] "served to provide an illegitimate and false consent" [...] to the territorial status, which he describes as resulting in the elimination of agricultural production, displacement of local businesses by large corporations and the application of obligatory service that served to serve both large scale wars and secondary interventions throughout Latin America. Directing his focus to the independence movement, he recognized the strategic differences between organizations but insisted that they {{should not be allowed to}} divide them, suggesting that a Constituent Assembly would be held <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them</b> once independence was achieved. Ojeda Ríos requested that those that choose to pursue an electoral alternative should employ the legislature to advance their cause and avoid diverting from this goal. He labelled the anti-war activities of Santiago and a campaign led by Marta Villaizán and Aleida Centeno denouncing the privatization and experimentation of local natural resources as examples to follow for the civil society and called attention towards the moves of the federal government in El Yunque and the intervention of Fortuño and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in this process. Ojeda Ríos closed his intervention by citing what he perceived as movements being made by Venezuela and Cuba to consolidate Latin American and the Caribbean and acclaimed independentist and Latin American unity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} half of the seventies were the first news about the {{presence}} of guerrillas in the villages, the commander aparacimiento Ramon, talking to people and saying they were the Guerrilla Army of the Poor. They passed many villages asking what problems people had and offering <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them.</b> The told peasants that the land belonged to the poor and that they should trust them. In 1977, Ramon a -guerilla commander- regularly visited the village of La Llorona and after finding that the issue of land was causing many problems in the community, taught people to practice new measurements, which spread fear among landowners. That same year, the group under Ramon arbitrarily executed the Spanish landowner José Hernández, near El Recreo, which he owner. Following this, a clandestine group of mercenaries, dubbed [...] "fighters of the rich" [...] was formed to protect the interests of landlords; public authority of El Estor organized the group and paid its members, stemming from the funding of major landowners. The group, irregular, was related to the military commissioners of the region and with commanders of the Army, although mutual rivalries also took place. The secret organization murdered several people, including victims who had no connection whatsoever with insurgent groups.|$|E

2500|$|This propagator {{cannot be}} correct {{in this way}} as it would violate causality. On the other side, it {{provides}} a linear rising potential, , that would give reason to quark confinement. An important aspect of this functional form is that the gluon propagator appears to go to zero with momenta. This will become a crucial point in the following. From these studies by Gribov, Zwanziger extended his approach. The inescapable conclusion was that the gluon propagator should go to zero with momenta while the ghost propagator should be enhanced {{with respect to the}} free case running to infinity. This became known in literature as the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. When this scenario was proposed, computational resources were insufficient to decide whether it was correct or not. Rather, people pursued a different approach using the Dyson-Schwinger equations. This is a set of coupled equations for the n-point functions of the theory forming a hierarchy. This means that the equation for the n-point function will depend on the (n+1)-point function. So, <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>them</b> one needs a proper truncation. On the other side, these equations are non-perturbative and could permit to obtain the behavior of the n-point functions in any regime. A solution to this hierarchy through truncation was proposed by Reinhard Alkofer, Andreas Hauck and Lorenz von Smekal. This paper and the following publications from this group, the German group, set the agenda for the determination of the behavior of the propagators in the Landau gauge in the subsequent years. The main conclusions these authors arrived to were to confirm the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario and that the running coupling should reach a finite non-null fixed point when momenta runs to zero. This paper represents the birth of the so-called scaling solution as the propagators are seen to obey scaling laws with given exponents. A proposal in the eighties by John Cornwall was in contrast with this scenario rather showing that the gluons get massive when momenta goes to zero and the propagator should be finite and non-null there [...] but went ignored at that time because the theoretical evidence appeared overwhelming for the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. Attempts to solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations numerically seemed to provide a different scenario but this could have been due to the way truncation and approximations were applied.|$|E

When applied to robot control, such methods allow to write more general and flexible control programs and enable reasoning about the robot’s observations, the actions involved in a task, action parameters and the reasons why an action was performed.
