5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E

25|$|Brian Tomasik cites ethical {{reasons for}} people to remain childfree. Also, they will {{have more time to}} focus on themselves, which will allow for greater {{creativity}} and the exploration of personal ambitions. In this way, they may benefit themselves and society more <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had a child.|$|E
25|$|Big Indian Farms is {{a remote}} {{clearing}} in the Chequamegon Forest where {{as many as}} 130 Potawatomi and others lived from around 1896 to 1908. In this isolated spot {{they were able to}} preserve their ancestors' culture better <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had lived under the direct influence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs on a reservation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people are}} married {{when they reach}} {{retirement}} age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, {{men are more likely}} to retire if their wives are also retired <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are still in the labor force, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} {{involved the}} same 308 electoral districts as in 2004, except in New Brunswick, where {{the boundary between}} Acadie—Bathurst and Miramichi was ruled to be illegal. Many of the candidates were also the same: fewer incumbents chose to leave <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had served a full term, and the parties have generally blocked challenges to sitting MPs {{for the duration of}} the minority government, although there had been some exceptions.|$|E
25|$|In November, OPERA {{published}} refined results {{where they}} noted {{their chances of}} being wrong as even less, thus tightening their error bounds. Neutrinos arrived approximately 57.8ns earlier <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had traveled at light-speed, giving a relative speed difference of approximately one part per 42,000 against that of light. The new significance level became 6.2sigma. The collaboration submitted its results for peer-reviewed publication to the Journal of High Energy Physics.|$|E
25|$|Across {{both types}} of skiing, LW9 {{competitors}} use skis that would be slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were able-bodied. If they are using outriggers, these are fitted to the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier is standing. While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant boards or toe boards. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
30|$|Exclusion criteria: Patients were {{excluded}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were younger <b>than</b> 18, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{did not actually}} have septic shock, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were not mechanically ventilated, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> received less <b>than</b> 0.25  mg/kg/min of norepinephrine, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> deceased before the 24 th hour, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were already {{included in this study}} or <b>if</b> less <b>than</b> 3 blood gases analysis was available during the first 72  h of their ICU care.|$|R

25|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} is a life-extending procedure. The typical {{patient will}} live 10 to 15 years longer with a kidney transplant than if kept on dialysis. The increase in longevity is greater for younger patients, but even 75-year-old recipients (the oldest group {{for which there}} is data) gain an average four more years of life. People generally have more energy, a less restricted diet, and fewer complications with a kidney transplant <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> stay on conventional dialysis.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{space is}} a {{precious}} commodity and public transport utilises it {{more efficiently than}} a car dominant society, allowing cities to be built more compactly <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were dependent on automobile transport. If public transport planning {{is at the core}} of urban planning, it will also force cities to be built more compactly to create efficient feeds into the stations and stops of transport. This will at the same time allow the creation of centers around the hubs, serving passengers' daily commercial needs and public services. This approach significantly reduces urban sprawl.|$|E
25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often medical waste, {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were to hire out a truck service.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two ski poles, except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one skis and two ski poles. The para-Alpine ski configuration {{is sometimes called}} a 3 track. FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In para-Nordic, skiers compete with two skis and two poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were able bodied. Skiers in this classification may use outriggers. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base, and are fitted for the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier is standing. In the biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|Many {{argue that}} Los Angeles paid an unfairly low price to the farmers of Owens Valley for their land. Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara {{observed}} that the price that Los Angeles {{was willing to pay}} to other water sources per acre-foot of water was far higher than what the farmers received. Farmers who resisted the pressure from Los Angeles until 1930 received the highest price for their land; most farmers sold their land from 1905 to 1925, and received less than Los Angeles was actually willing to pay. However, the sale of their land brought the farmers substantially more income <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had kept the land for farming and ranching. None of the sales were made under threat of eminent domain.|$|E
30|$|Not surprisingly, {{women tend}} to prefer longer term work {{arrangements}} <b>than</b> men, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have a temporary contract. In fact, while the share of women with a permanent contract is relatively low, that of women holding a temporary contract of between 1 and 3 years of length is greater.|$|R

25|$|When overs are lost, {{setting an}} {{adjusted}} {{target for the}} team batting second is {{not as simple as}} reducing the run target proportionally to the loss in overs, because a team with ten wickets in hand and 25 overs to bat can play more aggressively <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had ten wickets and a full 50 overs, for example, and can consequently achieve a higher run rate. The D/L method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{constant}} public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|After STW-9 {{entered the}} market, a 'cartel' was formed {{between the two}} {{stations}} for the duty of buying from both Australian and overseas production sources. The two stations set up a separate company, TV Facilities, (50%/50% partners). This allowed the stations to purchase programs cheaper <b>than</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were two separate entities, which would bid on shows and subsequently raise prices. This partnership was disliked by Eastern States stations who could not increase their charges to the extent which they would have liked. Allocation of programs was decided by a coin toss, which would allow the winner to pick first and then alternate the picking of programs. However TVW would always be in a more dominant position as it had the rights to continuing shows from the previous six years as well as half of the new programs.|$|E
25|$|Only about 30% of {{the graves}} have goods. This {{circumstance}} probably rightly {{has been interpreted}} {{as some sort of}} distinction in dominance, but the exact nature is not known. If the goods were gifts, then some were more honored <b>than</b> others; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were possessions, then some were wealthier than others.|$|R
