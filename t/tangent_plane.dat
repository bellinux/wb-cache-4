25|$|This {{notion of}} {{parallel}} transport of tangent vectors, by affine transformations, along a curve has a characteristic feature: {{the point of}} contact of the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> with the surface always moves with the curve under parallel translation (i.e., as the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> is rolled along the surface, the point of contact moves). This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections. In more modern approaches, the point of contact is viewed as the origin in the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> (which is then a vector space), {{and the movement of}} the origin is corrected by a translation, so that parallel transport is linear, rather than affine.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} {{breaks down}} {{only if there}} exists a point p for which s(p) is the antipodal point of p, since such a point {{is the only one}} that cannot be stereographically projected onto the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> of p.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{treatment}} of affine connections, {{the point of}} contact is viewed as the origin in the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> (which is then a vector space), {{and the movement of}} the origin is corrected by a translation, and so Cartan connections are not needed. However, there is no canonical way to do this in general: in particular for the conformal connection of a sphere congruence, {{it is not possible to}} separate the motion of the point of contact from the rest of the motion in a natural way.|$|E

A vector in the <b>tangent</b> <b>plane</b> is transported along a geodesic as the unique vector field with constant length and making a constant angle with the velocity vector of the geodesic.
