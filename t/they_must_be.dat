However, it remains less developed than Russia’s western regions and modernisation plans are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> an even number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in the}} statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} brings one materia {{into the}} party when they join, carrying one spell {{that can be used}} in combat. Materia have a limited number of uses before <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel tanks are located throughout the submarine: <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E

The college also has a three-year part-time master's degree in police science. As {{the chief of police}} and deputy chief of police are part of the prosecuting authority, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a candidate of law to act in such a position. Although there no longer is a formal requirement for such an education, the role as prosecutor effectively hinders others from holding the position.|$|E
5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E

When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> wisely spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. The main difference between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> revived before the level can be completed.|$|E

Upon asking why he was conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> conned themselves.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to participate in the}} Eurovision Song Contest. For broadcasters to participate, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> member of the EBU and register their intention to compete before the deadline specified in the rules of that year's event. Each participating broadcaster pays a fee towards the organisation of the contest. Should a country withdraw from the contest after the deadline, they will still need to pay these fees, and may also incur a fine or temporary ban.|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> expressed {{with common}} units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if {{a measure of}} 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E
