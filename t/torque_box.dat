There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction.

50|$|Unlike the Series 10, the Series 30 had {{leading edge}} devices {{to reduce the}} landing speeds at higher landing weights; full-span slats reduced {{approach}} speeds by 6 knots despite 5,000 lb greater weight. The slats were lighter than slotted Krueger flaps, since the structure associated with the slat is a more efficient <b>torque</b> <b>box</b> than the structure associated with the slotted Krueger.

50|$|On {{perimeter}} frames, {{the areas}} where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating {{what is known as}} <b>torque</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety {{in the event of}} a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, hence the use of <b>torque</b> <b>boxes,</b> and soft suspension settings.|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of the new simulation approach is tested for a typical vehicle structure in two possible orientations called normal mode and reversed mode. The results obtained for the impact problem in normal structural mode show that a desirable energy absorption pattern of 45 %, 25 % and 20 % of the total impact energy could be achieved through plastic deformation of the front frame, sheet metal and <b>torque</b> <b>box</b> respectively. Testing the impact system in reversed structural mode results in a rather poor energy absorption pattern in which 2.5 %, 50 % and 43 % of the total impact energy were absorbed through deformation of the front frame, sheet metal and <b>torque</b> <b>box</b> respectively, showing that unreasonably high {{percentage of the total}} impact energy is transmitted to the interior structures.|$|E

American Motors (with its partner Renault) during the late-1970s incorporated unibody construction when designing the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) platform using the manufacturing principles (unisides, floorpan with integrated frame rails and crumple zones, and roof panel) used in its passenger cars, such as the Hornets and all-wheel-drive Eagles for a new type of frame called the [...] "Uniframe ... a robust stamped steel frame welded to a strong unit-body structure, giving the strength of a conventional heavy frame with the weight advantages of Unibody construction."

40|$|Expressions are {{provided}} for calculating the torsional stiffness {{of a car}} body passenger compartment. The two main reaction systems which contribute towards the torsional stiffness, i. e. the couple due to shear forces in the roof and floor and the rectangular frame formed by the sill <b>torque</b> <b>boxes</b> and the end bulkheads of the passenger compartment, are considered separately. This enables the behaviour to be studied qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It is shown theoretically and diagrammatically that the first system {{is dependent on the}} bend stiffness of the members forming the door apertures. Simplifying assumptions permit the expressions developed to be sufficiently straightforward for them to be acceptable for repeated use in the design office to optimize the distribution of material. Alternative approaches are suggested for cases where greater accuracy is necessary. The basic expressions relate to a simplified structure but a technique is supplied for assessing the contribution of extra members. The effect of the horizontal offset of the wheel centres from the ends of the passenger compartment is dis-cussed and the influence of suspension and structure geometries on the effective offset is mentioned. Ways in which the deflections of the passenger compartment affect the front and rear end structures are discussed qualitatively...|$|R
2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by laying up the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular <b>torque</b> <b>boxes</b> {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from âˆ’5Â° to +15Â° as flaps and âˆ’4Â° to +16Â° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural load limit is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational load limit.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reversed}} system witnessed rapid {{consumption of the}} front frame within the first 20 milliseconds of the impact leading to transfer of huge amount of the impact load on the other components. As a result both the radiator and the sheet metal experienced unreasonably high peak deformation. Some of the interior structures which include; the <b>torque</b> <b>box</b> and the engine mount equally show extended deformation, suggesting increased structural intrusion and poor energy management scheme (FigureÂ  5 b). However, the firewall, the drive-line and transmission mount maintain similar deformation pattern as in normal structural mode but with slightly increased peak values (FigureÂ  6 b).|$|E

The following airplane sections, which are common on all of the airplanes in the family, will be presented: common nose cone design; common wing <b>torque</b> <b>box</b> design; and common tail cone design.

2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, <b>torque</b> <b>boxes</b> to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|R
40|$|A {{parabolic}} trough collector has been developed for various applications in the 200 - 400 Â°C temperature range in solar fields up to the hundreds Megawatts range.

40|$|While most {{instruction}} aims {{to provide}} students with content knowledge accompanied by practical application, the classroom experience typically has difficulty providing students with non-trivial examples. Graduating students also express a lack of confidence in integrating knowledge gained in disparate courses regarding identifying problems and synthesizing solutions. Many programs include industry-based projects as a solution to these issues. This approach has various drawbacks, including the difficulty of implementing such a project in a sizable number of the courses, the need for a significant commitment of class time, establishing contacts and ensuring that students have sufficient access to them to develop a model. The Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Department at Wichita State University is developing an integrated set of realistic virtual reality models of a manufacturing line at Boeing Wichita. This line and the virtual models will serve as a mega-case that will be used throughout the curriculum to vertically integrate the concepts across the curriculum and provide a situated learning experience for students.

A good correlation is obtained, both in the buckling and postbuckling behavior and in the collapse modality, demonstrating the capability of the dynamic explicit analyses to capture the highly nonlinear response of the aeronautical panels. The results also show the possibility of CFRP structures working deeply in the postbuckling region if properly designed and, consequently, the possibility of a weight reduction of aerospace structures thanks to the possibility of moving up the ultimate load toward the collapse load without any loss in the structural safety...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the great}} speed range in a {{finishing}} block of a wire rod mill, the reduction of torsional vibrations {{makes it possible to}} achieve closer rolling tolerances. The components transmitting the <b>torque</b> like gear <b>box,</b> coupling etc. can generate non-smooth or alternating torques which affect the product quality. To study the influences of torsion vibrations on the product quality, the dynamic interactions of the block and rolling process are simultaneously analyzed by a simulation model. As an example, a three stand arrangement is considered. The real transmission system is idealized as a structurally discrete torsional vibration model. The generalized rotational coordinates with a large number of rotational degrees of freedom can be reduced among others constants by means of gear ratios. Euler-Lagrange equations are applied to create the coupled equations of motion, which together constitute an ordinary differential equation of order 28. The rolling and main drive torques are defined as excitation for vibration {{on the right side of}} the equation system. A DC motor is selected as main drive and the voltage circuit equation of motor is integrated into the system of differential equations. The armature current and its interaction are consequently simulated. The rotational speed of rolls and motor, as well as roll torques, longitudinal stresses in rod and section widths are shown in diagrams as the result and thereby the torsional vibration of the essential elements of the system are studied for different temperatures and cross-sectional variations...|$|R
40|$|Fuel economy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters for vehicle powertrains, which is of particular interest for heavy-duty powertrain calibration. Conventionally, this work relies heavily on road tests, which cost more and may lead to long duration product development cycles. The paper proposes a novel hardware-in-loop modeling and calibration method to work it out. A dSPACE hardware-based test bench was successfully established and validated, which is valuable for a more efficient and easier shift schedule in calibration. Meanwhile, a real-time dynamic powertrain model, including a diesel engine, <b>torque</b> converter, gear <b>box</b> and driver model was built. Typical driving cycles that both velocity and slope information were constructed for different road conditions. A basic economic shift schedule was initially calculated and then optimal calibrated by the test bench. The results show that there is an optimal relationship between an economic shift schedule and speed regulation. By matching the best economic shift schedule regulation to different road conditions; the fuel economy of vehicles can be improved. In a smooth driving cycle; when the powertrain applies a larger speed regulation such as 12 % and the corresponding shift schedule; the fuel consumption is smaller and is reduced by 13 %. In a complex driving cycle, when the powertrain applies a smaller speed regulation such as 5 % along with the corresponding shift schedule; the fuel consumption is smaller and is reduced by 5 %. The method thus can provide guidance for economic calibration experiments of off-road heavy-duty vehicles...|$|R
