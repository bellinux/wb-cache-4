5|$|Hurricane Isidore was {{the ninth}} named storm {{and the second}} {{hurricane}} in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in September. The tropical cyclone peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, causing damage as well as four fatalities in Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. Isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern Gulf Coast as a Category4 hurricane, but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a <b>track</b> <b>change</b> that brought the storm over the Yucatán Peninsula for over a day, which significantly weakened the cyclone. Its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which fell across southeast Mexico and from the central United States Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley.|$|E

50|$|As {{documents}} {{changed and}} evolved, so did document comparison solutions. The {{second generation of}} documents began utilizing tables to manage a multiplicity of document layouts. Many document comparison solutions had difficulty comparing tables in document versions. These solutions first converted tables to text arrays and then compared the created arrays. In many cases, not enough due diligence on the software’s part was conducted; users would not be informed of sections that were not successfully compared. In the second generation, Microsoft’s <b>Track</b> <b>Changes</b> option was also introduced. With <b>Track</b> <b>Changes,</b> all changes made to documents were captured and stored inside the document. Flaws in the functionality of <b>Track</b> <b>Changes</b> could render the documents unusable and some comparison offerings again had difficulty managing the complex process of comparing in a <b>Track</b> <b>Changes</b> environment.|$|R

2500|$|Early {{television}} {{remote controls}} (1956-1977) used ultrasonic tones. [...] Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control {{functions such as}} power, volume, channels, playback, <b>track</b> <b>change,</b> heat, fan speed, or other features varying from device to device. [...] Remote controls for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects {{with an array of}} buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the remote control contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary controls. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{following}} single [...] "Itchycoo Park", {{released on}} 11 August 1967, is Small Faces' best-remembered song {{and was also}} the first of the band's two charting singles in the United States, reaching No. 16 in January 1968. The single was a bigger hit in Britain, peaking at No. 3. [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] was the first British single to use flanging, the technique of playing two identical master tapes simultaneously but altering the speed of one of them very slightly by touching the [...] "flange" [...] of one tape reel, which yielded a distinctive comb-filtering effect. The effect had been applied by Olympic Studios engineer George Chkiantz. [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] was followed in December 1967 by [...] "Tin Soldier", written by Marriott. Also, the track features American singer P.P. Arnold on backing vocals. The song was quite a hit reaching No. 9 on the UK charts and No. 73 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart. The Immediate Small Faces album was eventually released in the United States as There Are But Four Small Faces, with a considerable <b>track</b> <b>change,</b> including singles [...] "Here Comes The Nice", [...] "Itchycoo Park", and [...] "Tin Soldier", but eliminating several UK album tracks.|$|E
