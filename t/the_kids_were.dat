But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

[...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film.

[...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> homogeneous or heterogeneous. For homogeneous <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> rotten <b>kid</b> theorem holds irrespective of the parental policy instrument, implying that it is optimal to let <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> to <b>be</b> action leaders. If <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it <b>is</b> optimal whenever <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R

500|$|She went {{to drive}} the No. 99 Ford Thunderbird, owned by the poorly-funded Colburn Racing team for the 1995 season, and planned to run five races in the Winston Cup Series along with a full season in the Busch Series. Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark. She declined an offer to test at Daytona International Speedway while {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. Shortly before the birth of her two children, Robinson started her interior-decorating business from her home, and painted murals for homes and businesses. She said of her decision to have children: [...] "Racing is part of who I am, If I became a different person because I had kids, then <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> not going to know who I was my whole life before them." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Disney Channel's {{most popular}} and {{successful}} original shows, Kim Possible remains the project for which Schooley and McCorkle are best known. Few anticipated Kim Possible would become as successful as it ultimately did, proving popular among {{both male and female}} audiences. Explaining Kim Possibles universal appeal, the creators said, [...] "Whenever there's an action complement to a show, boys get excited, and when Kim does her martial arts and when she's doing one of these incredible stunts, boys love to watch it ... And {{one of the things that}} we’ve always found is that boys of any age ... love humour and characters that are a little goofy, sort of silly and weird. When we tested it, <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> like: 'Oh, Ron's stupid funny' and that became sort of a buzz phrase." [...] Ron's role helped maintain a strong male audience throughout the series. Kim Possible was greeted with a level of enthusiasm that had not been experienced since the Disney Afternoon Lineup, becoming Disney Channel's most successful post-1990s show. Disney Channel Worldwide President Rich Ross extolled Kim Possible as a [...] "stand-out" [...] among both the network's live-action and animated catalogue. The series maintains [...] "legions" [...] of devoted fans. A poll conducted by Disney Channel revealed that Kim Possible viewers voted for Season 3's [...] "Emotion Sickness" [...] as their favorite episode of the series. Entertainment Weekly ranked Kim Possible fourth on its list of the 25 greatest Disney Channel Original Series, calling it an [...] "animated gem". Kim Possible was placed at number nine on TV Guides ranking of [...] "The Best Disney Channel Shows". MTV ranked Kim Possible 13th in its article [...] "15 Disney Channel Series We Wish We Could Watch Again". The theme song [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] became so popular among fans of both the show and Milian herself that several of them proceeded to download it as their own cell phone ringtones.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the strip}} {{in its early}} years resembles its later form, there are {{significant}} differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or rugby football. Most of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> initially fairly round-headed.

When he worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA, he challenged other camp faculty by insisting that singing [...] "overtly Christian songs" [...] was inappropriate, as some of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> Jewish. [...] "I stood firm... no child {{is going to have a}} spiritual crisis on my watch."

2500|$|She {{would end}} up loathing Italia Conti saying, [...] "I hated the {{pressure}} {{that many of the}} children were under. Many of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> forced to grow up too fast, their careers were being decided for them before they were 13. If I went to an audition then they’d always choose the sweetest, prettiest kid. I wasn’t obviously beautiful so I used to miss out." [...] Ullman has also alleged that the owners taught their own children and that a certain level of favouritism seemed to exist. She also felt that the education she was receiving was of very little value. [...] "These stupid teachers would come in and go, 'Good morning, darlings, lets all be dustbins!' I'd go, 'Oh, shut up!

I come from a very musical family - every year we would meet on Christmas night and all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> encouraged {{to get up and}} perform. I think it was then that I realised I loved singing." [...] The first musical Mulholland appeared in was an amateur production of The Sound of Music, where she played Brigitta. Shortly before starting her course at the Central School of Speech and Drama, she moved to London and successfully auditioned for a part as a traditional Irish dancer, in the professional dance show, Dance of Desire, in which she spent four months.

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} [...] "In the Midnight Hour" [...] was a {{recording}} session on May 12, 1965, at which Wexler {{worked out a}} powerful rhythm track with studio musicians Steve Cropper and Al Jackson of the Stax Records house band, including bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn. (Stax keyboard player Booker T. Jones, who usually played with Dunn, Cropper and Jackson as Booker T. & the M.G.'s, did not play on the studio sessions with Pickett.) Wexler said to Cropper and Jackson, [...] "Why don't you pick up on this thing here?" [...] He performed a dance step. Cropper explained {{in an interview that}} Wexler told them that [...] "this was the way <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we'd been one-beat-accenters with an afterbeat; it was like 'boom dah,' but here was a thing that went 'um-chaw,' just the reverse as far as the accent goes." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us... They just shut us down... The park security and promoters evidently thought we were just evil and inciting riots."

2500|$|His {{first episode}} was [...] "Natural Born Kissers" [...] from season nine. The show's creator Matt Groening listed {{it as his}} eighth {{favorite}} episode in 2000. Selman considers his best episode to be season twelve's [...] "Trilogy of Error", {{which was based on}} the film Go, and features three inter-linked stories. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode, calling it [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them.". Other episodes he has written include [...] "Behind the Laughter", [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain", [...] "Husbands and Knives", [...] "The Haw-Hawed Couple", [...] "Future-Drama" [...] and [...] "That '90s Show". Selman stated he was [...] "proud" [...] of [...] "That '90s Show" [...] {{despite the fact that it}} [...] "irritated some of our more hardcore fans because they felt we were deliberately ret-conning the classic flashbacks of how Homer and Marge met and how <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>were</b> born." [...] He added that it was [...] "not a serious attempt to rewrite the show's continuity". He has won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the show, sharing them with the other producers. Selman received an Annie Award in 1999 for writing [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories". He also won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2004 for writing the episode [...] "The Dad Who Knew Too Little". In the episode, Homer's e-mail was said to be chunkylover53@aol.com. Selman registered the e-mail and received thousands of messages after the episode aired. He responded to some of them in the character of Homer, but gave up after being swamped with e-mails.|$|E
