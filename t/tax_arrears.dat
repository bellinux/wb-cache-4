5|$|In October–November 938, Bajkam and the Caliph campaigned {{against the}} {{influential}} Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Hasan ibn Abdallah, {{who had taken}} advantage of the turmoil in Iraq to cease forwarding his province's revenue to Baghdad. Although Bajkam's army captured Mosul, Hasan fled before him to the remotest corners of his domain, where Bajkam's forces pursued him in vain. In the meantime, the local population resented the presence of the caliphal troops and launched guerilla warfare against them, while Ibn Ra'iq used Bajkam's absence to take control of Baghdad {{at the head of a}} Carmathian force. These developments forced Bajkam to negotiate with his rivals: the Hamdanids were restored in their province in exchange for the payment of the <b>tax</b> <b>arrears,</b> and Ibn Ra'iq was bought off with the governorship of the provinces of Tariq al-Furat, Diyar Mudar, Qinnasrin and al-'Awasim, which were also claimed by the Ikhshidids of Egypt. This arrangement allowed Bajkam and the Caliph to return to Baghdad in February 939.|$|E

25|$|Faraj was toppled in 1412 by the Syria-based emirs, Tanam, Jakam, Nawruz and al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh, who Faraj sent a {{total of}} seven {{military}} expeditions against during his reign. The emirs could not usurp the throne themselves, however, and had Caliph al-Musta'in installed; the caliph {{had the support of}} the non-Circassian mamluks and legitimacy with the local population. Six months later, Shakyh eased al-Musta'in out of power after neutralizing his main rival, Nawruz, and assumed the sultanate. Shaykh's main goal in office was restoration of the state's authority within the sultanate, which saw further plagues in 1415–1417 and 1420. During his reign, Shaykh reestablished the state's fiscal administration to replenish the treasury. To that end, his fiscal administrator led tax collection expeditions that were akin to plundering throughout the sultanate to compensate for the <b>tax</b> <b>arrears</b> that had accumulated under Faraj's reign. Shaykh also commissioned and led military expeditions against the Mamluks' enemies in Anatolia, reasserting the state's influence in that region.|$|E
25|$|Another {{effect of}} Julian's {{political}} philosophy {{was that the}} authority of the cities was expanded {{at the expense of the}} imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the aurum coronarium was made voluntary rather than a compulsory <b>tax.</b> Additionally, <b>arrears</b> of land <b>taxes</b> were cancelled. This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself. Forgiving back taxes both made Julian more popular and allowed him to increase collections of current taxes.|$|R

40|$|The {{period of}} {{economic}} transformations {{which started in}} Poland at the early 1990 has revealed a number of weaknesses and maladjustments of enterprises, particularly those state owned, to the market economy demands. The Polish legislator, aiming at eliminating the adverse results of those phenomena {{as well as the}} causes of their occurrence, has introduced a number of legal acts establishing different institutions operating at different levels, among them the restructuring and recovery of financial management in enterprises. The aim of both is to restore the ability of businesses to compete in the market,and improve their financial condition. These aims can be realized with the help of selected legal instruments.

40|$|A decade {{into the}} transition, many {{successor}} {{states of the}} Former Soviet Union (FSU) continue to use pervasive energy sector quasi-fiscal activities, especially low energy prices and the toleration of payment arrears, to provide large implicit and untargeted subsidies to households and enterprises. These quasi-fiscal activities disguise {{the size of the}} government, cause over-consumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. Based on two case studies [...] one of an energy-exporting country (Azerbaijan) and one of an energy-importing country (Ukraine) [...] and a survey of other FSU countries, the study finds that energy quasi-fiscal activities have declined in some of the energy-importing countries (e. g., Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Ukraine), but risen in energy-rich countries (e. g., Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkmenistan), largely on account of higher international oil prices. We found that energy sector payment <b>arrears</b> have triggered <b>tax</b> and other payment arrears by energy companies, and helped to perpetuate a vicious circle involving arrears, offsets, netting operations, and noncash payments. Policy recommendations are straightforward, but politically difficult to implement: increase energy prices and eliminate preferential tariffs or the free provision of services for specific consumer groups, combined with the provision of explicitly budgeted and better targeted cash transfers to needy population groups, and, if necessary, explicit subsidies to enterprises. We also argue that greater efforts are required to capture energy quasi-fiscal activities through improved public data dissemination, fiscal analysis, and measures that promote fiscal transparency and accountability. energy prices, energy sector, fiscal policy, Former Soviet Union transition countries, implicit subsidies, implicit <b>taxes,</b> payment <b>arrears,</b> quasi-fiscal activities,...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{financing of}} local government bodies, of which Pourashava is an important part, {{has become a major}} challenge for Bangladesh. The density of municipal population is rising due in- migration and higher Population growth rate. The Pourashavas are responsible for providing infrastructure and services irrespective of social and economic background of the residents. The poor residing in municipal areas constitute about one third of total population and their tax payment capacities are very limited. The middle and upper class households pay most of the taxes. Also, by definition, property owners only pay Holding tax. Greater tax collection will eventually depend on the capability to pay. However, it is true {{that more than half of}} the gross domestic product comes from urban areas and thus it is assumed that tax payment capability is there within the Pourashava population. These people are expected to pay taxes if they receive better urban facilities. Over past years, total revenue of Pourashavas are increasing though the rate of increase is not in line with the demand for services. The demands for services are not being met adequately and increased doses of government and donor funding have been made available throughout the last decade. It is a matter of concern that the Pourashavas are not mobilizing potential revenue and not managing expenditure in a thorough and systematic manner. At this backdrop, Tangail Pourashava has taken a very timely decision to enhance its revenue base and strengthen its financial management system. Analysis of Tangail and five other Pourashavas reveals that the Pourahavas are not collecting taxes efficiently. Performance of collection of Holding tax is very low. Tangail Pourashava collected only 26. 26 % of its total demand for taxes in 1997 - 98. It had a total <b>arrears</b> <b>tax</b> demands of Tk. 29. 57 million in that year. Per capita collection was only Tk. 51. The total internal revenue of Tangail was Tk. 28. 40 million in the same year. This means that by ensuring collection of <b>arrears</b> <b>taxes,</b> The Pourashava can increase its revenue by a significant extent. By increasing tax rates and improving collection efficiency, the potential for enhanced revenue is also there in case of trade licenses, vehicle tax, entertainment tax and market fees. There is also scope for increased income from own property. A significant portion of the own revenue is spent on salaries, recurring expenses and minor development works. Major capital projects are funded by government grant. Grant constituted 49. 27 % of total Pourashava revenue in 1997 - 98.
