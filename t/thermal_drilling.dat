This sampling technique would extend the operational range of an impact penetrator, allowing it to reach zones well beyond the depths where organic matter might be altered by micro-meteoroids and radiation.

In <b>thermal</b> <b>drilling</b> process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards.

40|$|A common {{fear for}} all ice drillers is a stuck drill.

Prevention is {{the most efficient way}} to avoid troublesome situations. However, should these problems arise it is important to be equipped with safe and efficient tools. A stuck drill occurs rather frequently but it is rarely serious. Electro-mechanical (EM) drills usually become stuck due to inefficient chip removal from the kerf. When the drill gets stuck there are several possible actions. The simplest initial approach should be sharp jerks with a reverse rotating core barrel. Many times the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) dry hole EM drill has been successfully recover using this technique. When this technique fails, another solution to the problem is to pour a few liters of auto-antifreeze into the hole using a rubber hose to bypass the upper firn. This usually frees the drill in less than one hour. In 1999 the cable on the BPRC EM drill broke, but we successfully recovered the drill from 110 m depth using 2 ̆ 7 fishing tool 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|During {{the last}} twenty years over 10000 m of ice core have been {{recovered}} through the use of antifreeze thermal electric drills (ATED). An environmentally safe ethanol-water solution (EWS) was utilized as a borehole liquid. The ATED method has been widely used on high mountain temperate and polar glaciers. At glacier temperatures (T_i) from - 28 to - 8 ℃ the ATED penetration rate is about 420 - 450 m/wk (I. A. ZOTIKOV; CRREL Rep., 79 - 24, 12 p., 1979; V. S. ZAGORODNOV; Ice Core Drilling : Proc. 3 rd Int. Workshop Ice Drilling Tech., 97, 1989). In Antarctica a borehole of 800 m depth was drilled in ice at T_i=- 53 ℃ in two month. Drilling of this borehole was continued the next field season. The major cause of ice core fracture under <b>thermal</b> <b>drilling</b> is thermoelastic stresses. The quality of an ice core taken under ATED can be significantly improved applying the forced circulation of EWS at the borehole kerf. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that a modified ATED (m-ATED) reduces power consumption by 20 %- 40 %. The penetration rate of the m-ATED at low temperatures (below - 30 ℃) is estimated to be about 450 m/wk. The logistic cost for deep (> 1000 m) drilling with ATED is estimated to be about 25 % of the conventional thermal or mechanical drilling. Laboratory experiments show that ice can be dissolved by EWS. The phenomenon of ice dissolution by EWS can underlie the dissolution drilling technology (DDT).
