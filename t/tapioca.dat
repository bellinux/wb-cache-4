There, they learn that Bianca Castafiore, her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been imprisoned in San Theodoros for {{allegedly}} attempting to overthrow the military government of General <b>Tapioca.</b> Tapioca's government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus themselves. <b>Tapioca</b> invites the trio to visit San Theodores, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems {{it to be a}} trap, leaving Haddock and Calculus to go alone. Once there, the Captain and Professor are taken to a rural villa, where they are closely monitored by the security services.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{incorporated}} many {{characters from}} previous Adventures into Tintin and the Picaros; these include Pablo, Ridgewell, and the Arumbaya tribe from The Broken Ear, {{as well as}} Colonel Sponz from The Calculus Affair.

5|$|Jew {{said that}} he had been {{contacted}} by the owners of a local chain <b>tapioca</b> drink shop, Quickly, to resolve Quickly's business permit issues. Jew demanded $80,000 for his assistance, but agreed to accept $40,000. The shop owners then contacted the FBI, which supplied the cash for a sting operation. The FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew and hand over the money.|$|E
5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), <b>tapioca</b> preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry.

Meeting him backstage, Alcazar introduces them to his Indio assistant, Chiquito, and learn that he was deposed (once again) by his rival General <b>Tapioca.</b>|$|E
5|$|Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, {{began work}} on {{what was to become}} Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been {{inactive}} since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio– an old <b>tapioca</b> flour factory– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Kioe Lie visits {{his brother}} in the latter's Batavia home. Kioe Gie has become {{an editor of the}} {{newspaper}} Kamadjoean and is known as a generous philanthropist. Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a <b>tapioca</b> factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, or at least not take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no intent to marry Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.|$|E
5|$|With Pablo's assistance, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus {{escape from}} their guards and seek refuge with General Alcazar and his {{small band of}} anti-Tapioca guerrillas, the Picaros, who are hiding in the San Theodoran jungle. After {{realising}} that Pablo is a double agent working for <b>Tapioca,</b> they escape an attempt on their lives and then shelter for a time with the Arumbaya, an indigenous community who live within the forest. Here, Tintin is reunited with his old acquaintance, the explorer Ridgewell, who is living with the Arumbaya. Leaving the Arumbaya settlement, they eventually arrive at the Picaros' encampment, where they meet Alcazar's wife, Peggy.|$|E
25|$|Gastronomy include fishes, shrimps, {{crabs and}} {{lobsters}} {{are some of}} Maceió’s specialties. Fresh seafood is prepared from local recipes, such as <b>tapioca,</b> acaraje, carne-de-sol, cuscuz de <b>tapioca.</b> A kind of mollusk, the sururu, is appreciated {{in the city and}} is incorporated in many typical dishes.|$|E

25|$|<b>Tapioca</b> or cassava, yams and kumara also grow very well, as do {{different}} varieties of bananas. Coconut meat, passionfruit and limes dominated exports in the 1970s, but in 2008 vanilla, noni and taro {{were the main}} export crops.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} in Kerala to have a breakfast with nonvegetarian dishes, in {{contrast}} to other states in India. Chicken/mutton stews, lamb/chicken/beef/pork/egg curry, fish curry with <b>tapioca</b> for breakfast are common. A wide range of breakfast with non-vegetarian {{is common in}} Malabar and in Central Kerala.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} has three major rivers, several freshwater lakes {{and more than}} 300 ponds. The eastern region is forested, northern regions are mostly under rubber cultivation and the remaining areas have mixed dry land crops of coconut, plantain, <b>tapioca,</b> etc. Built up areas and rice fields complete the land use.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} the largest {{producer}} of bananas, turmeric, flowers, <b>tapioca,</b> the second largest producer of mango, natural rubber, coconut, groundnut and the third largest producer of coffee, sapota, Tea and Sugarcane. Tamil Nadu's sugarcane yield per hectare is the highest in India. The state has 17,000 hectares of land under oil palm cultivation, the second highest in India.|$|E
25|$|Coconuts grow in {{abundance}} in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk {{are commonly used}} for thickening and flavouring. Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers {{have led to a}} strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of the meal. Rice is grown {{in abundance}}, along with <b>tapioca.</b> It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food.|$|E
25|$|Currently (2016), most global MSG is {{produced}} by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for neutralization. During fermentation, Corynebacterium species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugar cane, <b>tapioca</b> or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. The Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.|$|E
25|$|Butter can be {{replaced}} with a vegan alternative such as Earth Balance's. Vegan (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Mindful Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayo. Vegan cheeses, such as Chreese and Daiya, are made from soy, nuts and <b>tapioca,</b> and can replace the meltability of dairy cheese. Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes. Cheese substitutes can be made at home.|$|E
25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which <b>tapioca</b> is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} natural {{features}} of South Sudan is the River Nile whose many tributaries have sources in the country. The region also contains many natural resources such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten, mica, silver, gold, and hydropower. The country's economy, {{as in many other}} developing countries, is heavily dependent on agriculture. Some of the agricultural produce include cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), sorghum, millet, wheat, gum arabic, sugarcane, cassava (<b>tapioca),</b> mangos, papaya, bananas, sweet potatoes, and sesame.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} has a rich variety of plants ranging from rare orchids, medicinal plants and spices to hedge plants, tuber crops, plants yielding edible fruits and fibre. Aromatic plants and spices such as pepper and ginger are cultivated {{on a large}} scale on the hilly tracts. Nedumangad taluka {{is one of the biggest}} centres of cultivation and trade of pepper and other hill produce. A major portion of the district comes under the middle plain and the region is under the cultivation of coconut, rice, <b>tapioca,</b> tuber crops, plantains and vegetabless.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{avoiding}} nonkosher gelatin is to substitute gelatin-like materials in its place; substances with a similar chemical behaviour include food starch from <b>tapioca,</b> chemically modified pectins, and carrageenan combined with certain vegetable gumsguar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gum acacia, agar, and others. Although gelatin is used for several purposes by {{a wide variety of}} manufacturers, it has started to be replaced with these substitutes in a number of products, due to the use of gelatin also being a significant concern to vegans and vegetarians.|$|E
25|$|Malayali cuisine is not {{homogeneous}} {{and regional}} variations are visible throughout. Spices form an important ingredient {{in almost all}} curries. Kerala {{is known for its}} traditional sadhyas, a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes. The sadhya is complemented by payasam, a sweet milk dessert native to Kerala. The sadhya is, as per custom, served on a banana leaf. Traditional dishes include sambar, aviyal, kaalan, theeyal, thoran, injipully, pulisherry, appam, kappa (<b>tapioca),</b> puttu (steamed rice powder), and puzhukku. Coconut is an essential ingredient in most of the food items and is liberally used.|$|E
25|$|Low {{rainfall}} made farming difficult {{until the}} introduction of irrigation. Currently, the area under cultivation is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharastra to about 10% in Western Ghats. Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double-cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, <b>tapioca,</b> and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of Jatropha has recently received more attention due to the Jatropha incentives in India.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, the {{vulcanisation}} {{technique was}} discovered by Charles Goodyear, which {{marked the beginning of}} the extensive use of rubber in industry. In Malaya, Henry Nicholas Ridley, Director of Singapore and Penang Botanical Gardens, introduced rubber plantations in the early 1890s when he managed to convince the Kinderly Brothers of Inch Kenneth Estate in Selangor and a Chinese <b>tapioca</b> planter, Tan Chay Yan in Malacca to adopt rubber plantations as a commercial enterprise. By 1911, labour imported from India involved in the rubber plantation sector totaled 126,665 people and Malaya became the world's largest producer of natural rubber. Educated Indians were employed in the estates' hospitals and clinics while the majority worked as rubber tappers.|$|E
25|$|For dessert, Recife offers bolo de rolo (cake roll), cake Souza Leão, and cartola (top hat cake) which {{consists}} of fried long bananas with cheese topped with cinnamon and sugar. The diversity continues for the breakfast as one can find cuscuz of sweet corn or manioc, yams and cassava with charque (corned beef or beef jerky), sweet potato, goiabada, fried long banana, mugunzá, regional fruits, bread, <b>tapioca,</b> rice pudding, porridge, yogurt, queijo coalho, corn bread, hominy and pamonha. Breakfast is often accompanied by coffee and/or milk and juices from regional fruits such as cashew, pineapple, mangoes, acerola, guava, passion fruit, umbu, hog plum, pitanga, jackfruit, orange, avocado and the regionally most famous caldo-de-cana and água-de-coco juices.|$|E
25|$|Kumara (sweet potato) {{chips are}} eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, beetroot, and carrot crisps are {{available}} in the United Kingdom. India is famous for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, <b>tapioca</b> chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Following the occupation, {{government}} offices re-opened on 26 December 1941 while banks remained closed until 1944. Zaibatsu {{are brought to}} monopolising essential goods and the Japanese authorities enforcing a food self-sufficiency policy. All resources including foodstuffs were exclusively reserved for Japanese troops with little excess given to local populace with a low ration. Through two well-established zaibatsu of Mitsui Morin and Mitsui Bussan, foodstuffs such as rice, maize, <b>tapioca,</b> sweet potatoes and coconut oil were monopolised including in purchase and distribution, while sago supplies controlled by the Mitsubishi's Tawau Sangyo. Those who are caught stealing or smuggling will be punishable by death. The IJA together with IJN work hardly to resuscitate the oil industry to contribute to Imperial Japan's war effort.|$|E
25|$|Nicaragua is {{primarily}} an agricultural country; agriculture constitutes 60% {{of its total}} exports which annually yield approximately US $300 million. Nearly two-thirds of the coffee crop comes from {{the northern part of}} the central highlands, in the area north and east of the town of Estelí. Soil erosion and pollution from the heavy use of pesticides have become serious concerns in the cotton district. Yields and exports have both been declining since 1985. Today most of Nicaragua's bananas are grown in the northwestern part of the country near the port of Corinto; sugarcane is also grown in the same district. Cassava, a root crop somewhat similar to the potato, is an important food in tropical regions. Cassava is also the main ingredient in <b>tapioca</b> pudding. Nicaragua's agricultural sector has benefited because of the country's strong ties to Venezuela. It is estimated that Venezuela will import approximately $200 million in agricultural goods. In the 1990s, the government initiated efforts to diversify agriculture. Some of the new export-oriented crops were peanuts, sesame, melons, and onions.|$|E
500|$|On 5 December, the {{territorial}} government announced that nearly 9,000 hectares of paddy fields had {{been damaged by}} torrential rainfall, including 4,420 hectares of paddy fields in Puducherry,4,248.34 hectares in Karaikal and 287.15 hectares in Yanam. The government also reported 1,544 hectares of sugercane fields under cultivation had been damaged, along with 297.73 hectares of plantains, [...] 231.9 hectares of <b>tapioca</b> and related tubers, 168.10 hectares of vegetable fields and eight hectares under betel-leaf cultivation. Proposed compensation rates would be as follows: [...] ) per hectare for betel-leaf losses, [...] ) per hectare for plantains, [...] ) per hectare for paddy fields and [...] ) per hectare for losses of vegetables, <b>tapioca,</b> tubers and sugercane. Compensation scales had also been set for losses of cotton, lentils and flowers.|$|E
500|$|Alcazar realises {{that the}} Picaros {{will not be}} able to launch a {{successful}} coup against <b>Tapioca</b> while they remain drunkards (owing to frequent parachute drops of whisky from Tapioca's forces), and to combat this problem Calculus provides them with tablets which render the taste of alcohol disgusting (and which he has been secretly testing on Haddock, Tintin, Ridgewell and the Arumbayas in the course of the story). Soon afterward, Jolyon Wagg and his troupe of carnival performers, the [...] "Jolly Follies", arrive at the camp, having lost their way to Tapiocapolis where they mean to take part in the carnival. At Tintin's suggestion, the Picaros disguise themselves in the Follies' costumes and enter Tapiocapolis during the carnival. There, they storm the presidential palace and seize control; Alcazar becomes president, with <b>Tapioca</b> and Sponsz being exiled to Borduria. Thomson and Thompson are rescued from a firing squad, while Castafiore and her assistants are released from prison.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Johor's economy {{began to}} diversify from gambier and pepper {{plantations}} to other agricultural crops. Starting with coffee in 1881, [...] crops such as <b>tapioca,</b> tea, pineapple and rubber were introduced into the state. Coffee and <b>tapioca</b> was quickly abandoned in the 1890s when the value of these crops experienced a drop, while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in Johor, as the world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910. Prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906, and many Kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber. Further {{decline in the number of}} gambier and pepper plantations was fuelled by the colonial government's suppression of traditional farming methods employed by the Kangchu for planting gambier and pepper; these method led to soil exhaustion and a depletion of forests which was used as firewood in small factories. A few years before the Kangchu system was abolished, exports for both gambier and pepper plunged by a further 60% between 1912 and 1917.|$|E
500|$|Tintin and the Picaros (...) is the twenty-third {{volume of}} The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian {{cartoonist}} Hergé. The final instalment {{in the series}} {{to be completed by}} Hergé, in Belgium it was serialized in Tintin magazine from September 1975 to April 1976 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1976. The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus as they travel to the (fictional) South American nation of San Theodoros to rescue their friend Bianca Castafiore, who has been imprisoned by the government of General <b>Tapioca.</b> Once there, they become involved in the anti-government revolutionary activities of Tintin's old friend General Alcazar.|$|E
