5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on Lavaca River in Jackson County. Five decades later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several <b>thousand</b> <b>items</b> were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, the artifacts were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. She determined that while most of the artifacts were Spanish, some definitively matched artifacts recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of the same time period.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} Tang dynasty tombs, the treasures within the {{imperial}} tombs of the Qianling Mausoleum were never stolen by grave robbers. In fact, in Li Chongrun's tomb alone, there were found over a <b>thousand</b> <b>items</b> of gold, copper, iron, ceramic figurines, three-glaze colored figurines, and three-glaze pottery wares. Altogether, the tombs of Li Xian, Li Chongrun, and Li Xianhui had over 4,300 tomb articles {{when they were}} unearthed by archaeologists. However, the attendant tombs of the mausoleum were raided by grave robbers. Among the ceramic figurines found in Li Chongrun's tomb were horses with gilt decoration supporting armed and armored soldiers, horsemen playing flutes, blowing trumpets, and waving whips to spur their horses. Ceramic sculptures found in the tomb of Li Xian included figurines of civil officials, warriors, and tomb guardian beasts, {{all of which were}} over a meter (3ft) in height.|$|E

25|$|Issues dropped, and in 1988 {{the service}} was reduced from 5 to 2 days a week, in part perhaps due to {{increasing}} mechanical difficulties. The once famously reliable van had problems with its radiator ensuring {{it had to be}} constantly stopped and attended by the last Mobile Librarian, Malcolm Fletcher. Then it blew a head gasket. With the onset of amalgamation of Birkenhead into the wider North Shore Libraries it was superseded by the system Mobile anyway, and the Bedford was eventually retired in 1992.
