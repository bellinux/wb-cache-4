On {{the basis}} of archival sources from the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb author reveals and {{analyses}} events {{from the beginning of}} 1882, when ban Pejačević and Croatian Parliament decided <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> <b>payment</b> of annual fee to priest Juraj Jeličić for his religious instructions in school in Selce. The entire case actually started a year earlier since during the elections for Croatian Parliament in 1881 Jeličić openly supported The Party of Right (Stranka prava) and this turned all the local political attention to him. At the same time local authorities had started investigation against him because of the rumours about his malpractice regarding the religious instructions, as well as court process because this priest had showed aggression against one of his political opponents. During the process all the local personnel witnessed against Jeličić, probably because he was in personal argue with most of them.

More rigid than Justinian he decided <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> neighbouring states although pragmatically the treasury was exhausted. This policy proved disastrous. Italy was lost once again as the Lombards overran it. In the East war with the Sassanids flared again in 572 and was to continue through the reigns of three emperors. This time an Armenian revolt against Sassanid rule precipitated conflict. Setbacks in this war were said to contribute to the failure of Justin's fragile health. In any case by 574 he abdicated, his wife Sophia and a general, Tiberius acting as regents until his death in 578.|$|R

The latter <b>discontinued</b> <b>payment</b> of the annual tribute to the caliph, prompting al-Mustansir to dispatch Nasir al-Dawla al-Hamdani to assert Fatimid authority. However, Nasir al-Dawla's army was decimated by the flooding of the Quwayq River, forcing him to retreat to Damascus in October 1048. Al-Mustansir replaced Nasir with Rifq as governor of Damascus and also appointed him governor of Aleppo, should he succeed in subduing that district. Furthermore, the caliph made all the local Fatimid governors in Syria subordinate to him.|$|R

Oklahoma agreed to make 50 annual payments and to pay the costs of operating the dam and lake. However, the state was unable to sell the water it needed to recover its costs, so the state <b>discontinued</b> <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> the federal government in 1997. The federal government sued the state for breach of contract and recovery of funds. The case wound its way through the courts and eventually Oklahoma lost the case when the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Thus, the Corps of Engineers legally owns Sardis Lake.|$|R

30|$|Our {{results showed}} that the women most likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> any {{endocrine}} therapy before five years were those who did not undergo chemotherapy or mastectomy. This finding remained after adjusting for treatment by a medical oncologist. Previous studies have reported that women not undergoing chemotherapy or mastectomy are more likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> therapy early. A large observational study of 8769 women followed for 4.5  years found that women undergoing chemotherapy before commencing endocrine therapy were significantly less likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> than other women, and those who had undergone mastectomy were less likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> than those who had a lumpectomy (Hershman et al. 2010). A shorter-term study (1  year follow-up) of > 13, 000 women also reported that women with pre-endocrine therapy mastectomy had nearly half the probability of non-adherence compared with women without mastectomy (Sedjo and Devine 2011). It may be that women who undergo more ‘aggressive’ treatments perceive their condition as more serious and their need for endocrine therapy greater, than other women.|$|R
