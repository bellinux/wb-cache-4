40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the likely economic {{consequences of a}} specific proposal for corporate income tax reform in Switzerland {{that is based on}} the recent ERU (2001) report. The proposal includes a partial dividend tax relief, more effective taxation of capital gains, and a property tax reduction, all relating to qualified stakes in corporate firms. Based on an analytical and quantitative analysis, we find that the reform removes an important <b>tax</b> <b>barrier</b> against dividend payments, reduces the cost of equity capital, thereby reduces debt leverage and encourages investment in the corporate sector. In stimulating transitional growth towards higher long-run income levels, the reform expands tax bases and thereby becomes considerably less costly in the long-run. A sensitivity analysis shows that the quantitative results are rather robust. 1 Tax reform, financial policy, organizational choice, dynamic general equilibrium modeling. ...|$|E

40|$|Compared to {{the other}} main sources of {{external}} development finance, such as international bank loans and Official Development Assistance, foreign direct investment (FDI) is viewed by Sub-Saharan African countries as being more supportive of their long-term economic development objectives. For this reason, they have implemented, and continue to adopt, {{a broad range of}} measures designed to enhance their attraction to foreign investors and thereby increase the levels of FDI they receive. However, emerging questions about the trade-offs of such measures have brought to the fore the question of what ought to be done to ensure that they continue to attract FDI {{and at the same time}} realize tangible benefits from such investment. This thesis argues for a tax treaty concepts and principles-based approach to the taxation of FDI. Specifically, it argues that sub-Saharan African countries can realize their objectives in relation to FDI by incorporating tax treaty concepts and principles into their domestic tax laws. The central argument and the conclusions from our analyses in the thesis are as follows: The desire by Sub-Saharan African countries to increase the levels of FDI they attract could be realized if they involve the removal of <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> to such investment. In seeking to attract increased levels of FDI, priority should be given to the objective of raising tax revenue compared to other nontax economic benefits. The removal of <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> and the revenue-raising objective can be achieved by basing the taxation of all FDI on tax treaty concepts and principles. The most appropriate mechanism for adopting a tax treaty concepts and principles-based approach to the taxation of FDI is to incorporate such concepts and principles into domestic tax laws.

These two very different investigations of Ontario’s tax structure, produced in two very different economic and political climates, reached surprisingly similar conclusions.

Wealthier Parisians consumed wines brought from Bordeaux and Burgundy; the Parisian middle class and workers drank wines from regions all over France, usually brought in barrels by boat or by road. In 1725 there were an estimated 1,500 wine merchants in Paris. The royal government profited from the flood of wine coming to Paris by raising taxes, until wine was the most highly taxed product coming into the city in 1668, each barrel of wine barrel of wine entering Paris by land was taxed 15 livres, and 18 livres if it arrived by boat. By 1768 the government raised the taxes to 48 livres by land and 52 by water. To avoid the taxes, hundreds of taverns called guinguettes sprang up just outside the <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> {{on the edges of}} the city, at Belleville, Charonne, and new shanty-towns called La Petite-Pologne, Les Porcherons, and La Nouvelle-France. A pint of wine sold in these taverns was taxed 3.5 sous a pint, while the same amount was taxed 12 to 15 sous inside Paris. The tax was hated by the Parisians, and was an important cause of the growing hostility to the royal government before the Revolution.|$|R

Due to doubts about the EU by member states this research focuses on the effect of the EU on road transport of the EU sample. Therefore, an analysis will be done on short-term (4 years) and long-term (12 years) and legal changes influencing the road transport. A deductive approach focused on secondary data is used. Via non-probability sampling, a sample of eight out of 28 member states is used. The data analysed is mostly quantitative data supported by qualitative data focusing on the legislation. To analyse the two variables, GDP per capita and road transport volumes, calculations regarding correlation, decoupling and significance are used to see the link between the variables and to test the reliability. The conclusion based on the results of this research show a positive effect of member states after entering the EU. On the short-term and long-term, the GDP per capita and road transport volumes showed positive results and the investments on the short-term also showed a positive outcome.

40|$|During {{the last}} 8 years Brazil has {{experiencing}} a large program of commercial overture. A lot of administrative and <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> had suppressed and the textile sector {{had been one}} of the most affected by this process. The paper analyses the regional impact of this process over the so-called textile chain (cotton-textile-confections) utilising dates of production and sales from 1980 until 1994 for the most important production regions in Brazil. These informations are analyzed by nonparametrical statistics. In a synthesis, the commercial overture that happened in Brazil during the last 8 years didn't change the structural tendencies in the spatial division of work of the production links of Cotton, Textile and Confections. It incremented the Cotton March to West, the concurrence among decadent textiles regions as Pernambuco, Minas Gerais and S?o Paulo and those, more dynamics, as Santa Catarina and Ceara. The commercial overture has been a double, because are growing the exports and imports figures of Textile. On the other hand those that are still using old technologies, are closing the plants. But the price of this adjusting process was paid by the cotton's farmers and, maybe, by the small and medium firms of Confections. The new regions are growing due to different factors. Ceara, in the northwest of Brazil, due to fiscal incentives by SUDENE and advantages from direct importation of cotton from Africa. Santa Catarina, in the south, due to a special characteristic of its industrial organisation and a new territorial organisation of production buying cotton from Argentina, Paraguay and Parana (Brazil) and inputs textile from EEC. ...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand {{is a small}} {{open economy}} that is remote from all major markets. The {{smallness}} and remoteness of New Zealand combine to imply that this country has, at least quantitatively, distinctive features for the regulation of economic activity by competition law. The isolation and small size of the economy mean that typically all but exporting firms are small as judged on a world scale, and that domestic markets are small and generally highly concentrated. This paper reviews the economic literature on the implications of an economy’s size and isolation for competition law. The literature suggests that principles underlying competition law do not change for small economies, but that the application of competition law should be different. In small economies, low regulatory and <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade dominate the importance of competition law for good economic performance of domestic markets. In these economies, competition law should focus on economic benefit/detriment evaluations of mergers and trade practices rather than rules of thumb of the sort based on measures of market structure and indicators of competition, or those aimed at prohibiting particular practices per se. Producers’ surplus should not be de-emphasised in the calculation of benefits and detriments in small economies; particularly for activities that relate {{in any way to}} (potential) export activity. For any economy, particularly in the presence of competition, cooperation enhances economic performance in specific circumstances. In small economies cooperation can be particularly efficient-for example, in achieving scale and thereby export performance-although it may entail interaction among a large fraction of players in an industry. The approach that the literature suggests to the application of competition law in small economies places relatively heavy weight on dynamic efficiency as the criterion for competition law design and enforcement. It is squarely in accord with recommendations in the literature on desirable competition law for the so-called new economy.

5000|$|The {{interest}} each minister {{exhibited in}} the other's country fostered {{the development of the}} relationship. By the mid-1950s, there was a flurry of new bilateral activity. In 1954, for example, the two countries' departments of immigration, aware that each confronted similar problems in settling the wave of postwar European immigrants, established the first of many inter-governmental exchange programs. At the same time, stimulated by the postwar economic boom, officials began to dismantle those <b>tax</b> <b>barriers</b> that discouraged investors from seeking new investment opportunities in the other country. By the end of the decade, Canadian direct investment in Australia had more than doubled. The quickening pace of bilateral relations attracted the attention of Pearson's cabinet colleagues. In 1955, Canada's ubiquitous [...] "minister of everything", C.D. Howe, visited Australia in his capacity as deputy prime minister. Howe's visit, which led to a 1959 agreement on nuclear cooperation, heralded a slow but steady stream of Canadian visitors that culminated in 1958 when John Diefenbaker became the first Canadian prime minister to visit Australia. A good many of these visitors were struck by Australia's potential as a market for Canadian products. Canadian exports had remained stagnant for most of the 1950s, constrained by the import restrictions that Australia imposed to protect sterling's weak foreign exchange position. This hiatus gave the booming Australian economy an opportunity to redress its perpetual trade deficit with Canada and exports to Canada doubled during the decade.38 As Australia gradually liberalized its import regulations in the late 1950s, there were grounds to hope that the warm political partnership might secure preferential access for Canadians to this strong economy. After two years of discussions, which were complicated by Canadian efforts to protect its dairy and agricultural industries, a new trade agreement with most of the substantive provisions found in its 1931 predecessor, came into effect in June 1960. When combined with Australia's decision to lift the last of its import restrictions, its effect on trade was dramatic. In three years, Canadian exports to Australia almost doubled from $54.2 million in 1959 to $105 million in 1962. By 1964, they had jumped to almost $146 million.|$|R
