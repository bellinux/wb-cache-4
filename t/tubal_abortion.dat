30|$|Lithopedion {{describes}} an intraabdominal calcified dead fetus. A lithopedion {{can result from}} a primary abdominal pregnancy, or from a secondary abdominal implantation following <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion</b> or rupture of tubal or intrauterine pregnancy. It occurs when a sterile extrauterine fetus survives for more than 3  months in abdominal cavity and escapes medical discovery along with minimal and sluggish circulation inviting calcium deposition (Irick et al. 1970; Frayer and Hibbert 1999; Costa et al. 1991). Secondary abdominal implantation is one of rarest consequence of ruptured tubal pregnancy {{and the formation of}} lithopedion out of it is even rarer.|$|E

30|$|In {{a medical}} field with {{extensive}} scientific advances, ectopic pregnancy remains {{a major cause}} of death, particularly during the first trimester (Varma and Gupta [6]). Risk factors include previous ectopic, PID, smoking, multi-parity, previous <b>abortion,</b> <b>tubal</b> surgery, assisted reproductive technology, extremes of age, IUD, and DES exposure in utero [7]. Nitric oxide and low socioeconomic status were also reported as potential risks [8, 9]. However, in up to 50  % of the cases, no risk factors can be identified [10].|$|R
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells. They {{are able}} to induce {{immunity}} on the one hand, {{on the other hand}} DC {{play a central role in}} the induction of peripheral tolerance. The presence of different maturation states of DC has been described at the feto-maternal implantation site of intrauterine pregnancies (IUP). It is assumed that the interaction of immature DC with natural killer (NK) -cells plays an important role for the induction and maintenance of feto-maternal tolerance. Mature DC are characterized to exhibit protective features but they might also be responsible for the development of intrauterine abortions by inducing a T-cell mediated immune response. Tubal pregnancies (TP) provide an important comparison: while the presence of mature and immature DC in IUP has been stated by several studies, there is little known about the presence of these cells in the extrauterine implantation site of TP. The TP is characterized by a different invasive behaviour of trophoblast cells and a different pattern of immune cells (e. g. absence of NK-cells). In this study for the first time the pattern of mature and immature DC at the implantation site of TP was analysed and compared to the pattern in the IUP. A differentiation was made between viable tubal pregnancies (VTP) and <b>tubal</b> <b>abortions</b> (TA). We examined seven specimens of decidual tissue obtained from women with intact IUP undergoing abortion in the 5. - 9. week of gestation, ten specimens of VTP (identified by colour Doppler sonography) and five specimens of TA. VTP and TA were of the same gestational age as the IUP. Immunohistochemical staining protocols were established on paraffin sections. The following surface markers were examined on serial sections: 1. Cytokeratin 7 (identification of implantation site), 2. CD 83 (mature DC), 3. DEC 205 (immature, activated DC), 4. DC-SIGN (immature, macrophage-like transient state of DC), 5. CD 14 (identifies monocytes/macrophages). For CD 14 single labelling was performed as well as for some specimens double labelling with DC-SIGN. IUP and VTP show nearly the same pattern of mature and immature DC. Regarding the different maturation states examined DC-SIGN+ DC are found in highest numbers. Thus, DC-SIGN+ DC may be of importance for the establishment of feto-maternal tolerance in both entities. A high percentage of DC-SIGN+ cells are stained for the monocyte/macrophage marker CD 14 as well. While immature, activated DEC 205 + DC show intermediate cell numbers, very few mature CD 83 + are found in the tissue. The fact that the different maturation states of DC are found equally in intrauterine and extrauterine site of trophoblast implantation suggests that DC play an important role for the immunological processes in TP as they do in IUP. As tissue of TP lacks NK-cells, DC-SIGN+ DC may interact with other immunological cells to establish feto-maternal tolerance than in IUP. The same pattern of DC is observed in TA and VTP. Thus it is unlikely that DC specifically influence the development of a VTP into a TA. As IUP and TP exhibit the same pattern of DC these cells are probably not responsible for the increased invasiveness of trophoblast cells in VTP. The specific role of DC and their interaction with other immunological cells in TP has to be analysed by further studies. This may clarify to what extent the DC plays a rather protective role in TP as it is assumed for IUP. Furthermore this may reflect how DC are part of the pathophysiological processes of VTP and TA...|$|R
40|$|Peritoneal pregnancies are {{classified}} as primary and secondary. Primary implantation on the peritoneum is extremely rare in extrauterine pregnancy and is a potentially life-threatening variation of ectopic pregnancy within the peritoneal cavity, representing a grave risk to maternal health. Secondary abdominal pregnancies {{are by far the}} most common and result from <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion</b> or rupture, or less often, after uterine rupture with subsequent implantation within abdomen. Early diagnosis and appropriate surgical management, regardless of stage of gestation, appear to be important in achieving good results. We report a case of primary peritoneal pregnancy in a 28 -year-old woman, who had severe lower abdominal pain one day before laparotomy for a preoperative diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. The conceptus was implanted on the left uterosacral ligament. A fresh embryo of approximately 8 weeks' gestation was found in the conceptus...|$|E
40|$|While ectopic {{pregnancy}} {{is a common}} occurrence, especially in the nonwhite female patient population, heterotopic pregnancy has traditionally been regarded as a rare clinical event until recently, especially {{with the advent of}} assisted reproductive procedures. We reported two cases, one in which an intrauterine pregnancy was discovered after a diagnosis of <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion,</b> another in which a patient underwent laparotomy for a tubal {{ectopic pregnancy}} with a concomitant previously diagnosed intrauterine pregnancy. The first patient subsequently delivered at term, while the second was lost to follow-up. In both cases, there was a delay in detecting the ectopic pregnancy component. These cases suggest that the clinician maintain a reasonable index of suspicion while evaluating a patient presenting with pelvic pain {{in the face of a}} documented intrauterine pregnancy. They also demonstrate the need for prompt and immediate action at the first sign indicating ectopic pregnancy to avoid missing this potentially life-threatening condition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{case report}} {{describes}} a 29 -year-old nulliparous woman that was admitted at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the Clinical Hospital Osijek complaining of mild abdominal pain without vaginal discharge. Case Outline. The patient’s menstrual cycle was irregular, from 30 - 45 days. An ultrasound examination showed suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy with a βHCG level of 1358 IU/L. Due {{to the presence}} of liquid in the pouch of Douglas the patient underwent emergency laparoscopy, which showed the presence of tumor mass between the right Fallopian tube and the appendix. These two structures associated with adhesions corresponded to secondary implantation after spontaneous <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion</b> which was confirmed by histopathologic analysis. Conclusion. Laparoscopy has emerged as the “gold standard” in the diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy, in this case the secondary abdominal pregnancy. From the diagnostic point of view, all women of reproductive age should be considered pregnant until proven otherwise, also keeping in mind that ectopic pregnancies can have different locations and many clinical features...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, Burbank's {{first major}} {{hospital}} opened {{under the name}} [...] "Burbank Community Hospital". The 16-bed facility served the community during a deadly smallpox epidemic in 1913 and helped it brace for possible air raids {{at the start of}} World War II. The two-story hospital was located at Olive Avenue and Fifth Street. By 1925, the hospital was expanded to 50 beds and in the mid-1980s operated with 103 beds and a staff of over 175 physicians. For years, it also was the only hospital in Burbank where women could receive <b>abortions,</b> <b>tubal</b> ligations and other procedures not offered at what is now Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. A physicians group acquired the hospital for $2 million in 1990 and renamed it Thompson Memorial Medical Center, in honor of the hospital's founder, Dr. Elmer H. Thompson. He was a general practitioner who made house calls by bicycle and horseback. In 2001, Burbank Community Hospital was razed {{to make way for a}} Belmont Village Senior Living community. Proceeds from that sale went to the Burbank Health Care Foundation, which assists community organizations that cater to health-related needs.|$|R
40|$|Tubal {{pathology}} is {{a common}} cause of subfertility. Identifying risk factors for tubal pathology in the medical history is important to distinguish between those couples who benefit from early tubal patency tests and those in whom presence of tubal pathology is less likely and delaying tubal tests is justified. This study evaluated whether a medical history of induced abortion is {{associated with an increased}} risk of tubal disease among subfertile couples. The reproductive history was determined for each couple. Tubal disease was diagnosed by hysterosalpingography and/or diagnostic laparoscopy. The association between reproductive history and the presence of tubal disease was assessed by calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Data from 6149 couples were available for analysis. The OR for tubal pathology after a previous induced abortion was 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 1. 9), after a previous ectopic pregnancy, 8. 4 (95 % CI 6. 3 to 12), after a previous spontaneous miscarriage, 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 87 to 1. 3), and after a previous live birth, 1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 88 to 1. 2). A history of induced abortion is associated with an increased risk of tubal pathology in subfertile couples. As a consequence, in subfertile women with a history of induced <b>abortion,</b> <b>tubal</b> patency tests should be considered early in the diagnostic work-u...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the process can take two different directions. If an intact pregnancy continues to grow, there is a <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion</b> or a rupture of the Fallopian tube. In the oppsote case, there is spontaneous resorption of the tubal pregnancy. In certain cases with the application of methotrexate, the ectopic pregnancy growth can be interrupted and spontaneous resorption can be induced. Nowadays, the international standards of treating patients with early ectopic gravidities and no peritoneal effusions, with ß-HCG values below 6000 Ul/I, gestational sac diameter below 3 cm, and without any visible heart action, imply methotrexate treatment. The objective {{of this study is}} to prove the efficiency of methotrexate use in patients who meet the above criteria. The first group did not manifest satisfying decrease of ß-HCG after two measurements, so methotrexate was used, while the second group showed satisfying decrease of ß-HCG, measured on the third day. Comparing the velocity of decrease of ß-HCG level among both groups of patients, it was proved that iatrogenically induced decrease, that is to say the achieved resorption, was equal to the spontaneous resorption, which justified the use of methotrexate in ectopic pregnancy treatment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Secondary {{abdominal}} pregnancies usually {{develop as}} a result of a <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion,</b> tubal rupture or uterine rupture with intraabdominal implantation. Case Report: We report a 40 -year-old patient gravida IV, para III suffering from abdominal pain. She was in the 29 th week of gestation according to a 14 thweek normal sonogram. She had unsuccessfully attempted to induce abortion with the assistance of a home midwife in the 14 th week. This caused severe abdominal pain, but she chose not to be hospitalized because of fear of prosecution. Ultrasound demonstrated that the fetus was out of the uterus and revealed a heterogeneous mass in the left lower quadrant. Laparotomy revealed an area of thin fibrotic scar behind the uterus with normal tubes and ovaries. The fetus in the amniotic sac was surrounded by intestinal loops. The placenta, implanted behind the left broad ligament at the edge of the scar area was removed with a brisk bleeding, which was controlled. No postoperative complications were observed. Conclusion: Presence of little free fluid and a uterine scar with normal fallopian tubes against a history of an unsuccessful induced abortion and severe illness are highly suggestive of a uterine rupture resulting in secondary implantation on the broad ligament. This is probably the first case that shows an abdominal pregnancy can result from unsuccessful induced abortion. In the countries where abortion is not permitted, patients with low socioeconomic status are prone to the dangerous consequences of illegal attempts to induce abortion. Close observation and special follow-up care are necessary in such cases...|$|E
40|$|Embryo {{implantation}} {{and subsequent}} decidualization, trophoblast invasion and {{formation of a}} functional placenta are crucial for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Interleukin- 11 signalling {{has been shown to}} be obligatory for adequate deci-dualization and trophoblast invasion in mice. Defects in IL- 11 signalling in mice result in trophoblast over-invasion and fetal loss. The pathological situation of human tubal pregnancy resembles that of IL- 11 Ra 2 / 2 mice concerning these symptoms. As our interest is focused on the human early pregnancy, we compared IL- 11 expression at the implantation site of ectopic tubal pregnancy (EP) to 1 st and 2 nd trimester of normal intrauterine pregnancies (IP), and to the normal cycling endo-metrium. The mRNA expression of IL- 11 and IL- 11 Ra was analysed by semiquantitative RT–PCR. Protein expression was detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. IL- 11 Ra is expressed constitutively in all tissue specimens analysed. IL- 11 is expressed predominantly during follicular and early luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In IP, IL- 11 expression peaks during the 1 st trimester and declines from the beginning of the 2 nd trimester onwards. In tubal abortions, IL- 11 expression is reduced in comparison to vital EP and IP. Cultured primary endometrial and decidual epithelial cells were analysed for hor-monal regulation of IL- 11 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and RT–PCR. IL- 11 is up-regulated by estrogen and down-regulated by progesterone. Overall, our results indicate that in humans, IL- 11 signalling is significantly involved in regulation of trophoblast invasion. In the case of <b>tubal</b> <b>abortion,</b> inadequate IL- 11 signalling may therefore result in dysregulation of trophoblast invasion.
