25|$|Referring to potentiality, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right {{and it is not}} prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
500|$|Most critics {{reviewed}} [...] "Get Me a Lawyer" [...] positively. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised FX {{for choosing}} another series that [...] "keep the light {{focused on the}} dark side of its main characters". Stanley wrote that [...] "Damages is yet another show that requires viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot, but it is the most grown-up thriller in the pack [...]" [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, in the episode, [...] "All the drama is in the writing and the acting." [...] He complimented the [...] "strong cast", stating that [...] "it's Close who makes Damages a series to contend with". Writing for The Age, Robin Oliver called the pilot [...] "terrific-going-on-sensational". She praised Close and Byrne's performances, but also highlighted Danson's role as [...] "a particularly fine piece of casting". Oliver's Age colleague Melinda Houston called Close [...] "delicious – and convincing" [...] as Patty and thought that the script was [...] "fabulous". S. P. Miskowski of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, [...] "For my money, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> 'thriller' is all about." [...] TV Squad's Jonathan Toomey enjoyed the episode's flashbacks, saying that the style of the show [...] "works and it works well". Matt Mitovich claimed in a TV Guide recap of the episode, [...] "What a pilot it was!" [...] He praised the acting from Close, Danson and Byrne, while he felt that [...] "the supporting cast is excellent as well". Stuart Levine, writing for Variety, called the pilot his favorite episode of the first season.|$|E

500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schiller {{believes}} his pragmatism {{to be more}} developed because of its {{attention to the fact}} that the [...] "consequences" [...] which make up the meaning and truth of a statement, must always be consequences for someone's particular purposes at some particular time. Continuing his condemnation of the abstract, Schiller contends that the meaning of a concept is not the consequences of some abstract proposition, but what consequences an actual thinker hopes its use will bring about in an actual situation. The meaning of a thought is what consequences one means to bring about when they employ the thought. To Schiller, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> more sophisticated pragmatist understands by the term meaning.|$|E

But on this grand point of {{the restoration of the}} country there is not one syllable {{to be found in the}} correspondence of our ministers, from the first to the last; they felt nothing for a land desolated by fire, sword, and famine: their sympathies took another direction; they were touched with pity for bribery, so long tormented with a fruitless itching of its palms; their bowels yearned for usury, that had long missed the harvest of its returning months;[40] they felt for peculation, which had been for so many years raking in the dust of an empty treasury; they were melted into compassion for rapine and oppression, licking their dry, parched, unbloody jaws. These were the objects of their solicitude. These were the necessities for which they were studious to provide.|$|E

Well, you will judge. I won't tell you how I think of it. And you won't care if I do. There is also a new very pretty landscape piece, and you may imagine the local politics of the arrangement and hanging, with their talk and consultation; while I, on the storey higher, have my arranging to manage of my pretty new books and my three hyacinths, and a pot of primroses which dear Mr. Kenyon had the good nature to carry himself through the streets to our door.

5000|$|The Assay Office is a {{historic}} building at 210 Main Street in Boise, Idaho.

Due to the difficulty of transporting bulky, heavy ores the long distance to the nearest U.S. Mint in San Francisco, there was great demand for an assaying office in Idaho.
