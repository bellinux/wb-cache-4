Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>we</b> were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E

500|$|Coffin's first {{jobs were}} to design small flower gardens {{such as the}} {{suburban}} garden she designed for Edward Sprague in 1906 in Flushing, Queens. Noted for its original design, it was situated on a modest lot measuring 150 feet by 300 feet (45 m by 91 m), typical of the new suburban developments being built on Long Island at the time. A few years later, she wrote about the Sprague garden in Country Life in America and Elsa Rehmann also discussed it in her 1918 book The Small Place: Its Landscape Architecture. Coffin argued that a [...] "moderately well-to-do" [...] homeowner could create and maintain a substantial and elaborate garden for a modest expenditure, {{comparable to that of}} a mid-range car. She promoted the idea that even the most featureless lot could be beautified through good design: [...] "We certainly cannot create a magnificent view, but we can plan and plant beautiful screens and backgrounds that will be interesting at all seasons of <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>We</b> may not easily be able to construct a picturesque diversity at ground level, but we can plant so as to have much height and variety in our flower and shrub groups." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} George Bott regards John Dalton (1709–63) and John Brown (1715–66) as {{the pioneers}} of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet Thomas Gray published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described {{the view of the}} town as [...] "the vale of Elysium in all its verdure", and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake. His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott's phrase, [...] "an effective public relations job for Keswick." [...] Painters such as Thomas Smith of Derby and William Bellers also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area. In 1800 the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, [...] "It is no small advantage that for two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>we</b> are in complete retirement – the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of all shapes & sizes." [...] Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow Lake Poets (see below) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.|$|E

2500|$|Plans {{to record}} a {{follow-up}} to Era Vulgaris had been mentioned since 2008, but recording would not begin until August 2012. In March 2011, Homme stated, [...] "Doing the rehearsals for the first record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are coming home!" [...] According to Homme, the album would be finished {{by the end of}} 2012. He explained to BBC Radio 1, [...] "We're going to take our one last break that we would get for a month, come back and do Glastonbury, then immediately jump in the studio.

2500|$|In 1847-48, he {{toured the}} British Isles. He also visited Paris between the French Revolution of 1848 and the bloody June Days. When he arrived, {{he saw the}} stumps of trees that had been cut down to form {{barricades}} in the February riots. On May 21, {{he stood on the}} Champ de Mars in the midst of mass celebrations for concord, peace and labor. He wrote in his journal, [...] "At the end of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>we</b> shall take account, & see if the Revolution was worth the trees." [...] The trip left an important imprint on Emerson's later work. His 1856 book English Traits is based largely on observations recorded in his travel journals and notebooks. Emerson later came to see the American Civil War as a [...] "revolution" [...] that shared common ground with the European revolutions of 1848.|$|E
2500|$|When again nothing took place, {{predictions}} regressed {{to their}} earlier short-term orientation. The Watch Tower wrote: [...] "It {{may be that}} many of the Lord's people were expecting more than they should have looked for to occur {{with the opening of the}} Jewish year 1915, which began with September 21. The human mind seems to have a natural tendency, and one with which we should have sympathy, to expect matters to culminate more rapidly, fulfillments to come more suddenly, than they ever do come ... Studying God's Word, we have measured the 2520 years, the Seven symbolic Times, from that year 606 B.C. and have found that it reached down to October, 1914, as nearly as we were able to reckon. We did not say positively that this would be <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>We</b> merely left every one to look at the facts of history and reckon for himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} 2nd century, some bishoprics {{in the eastern}} Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, {{but there was no}} {{agreement}} on the correct epoch – Clement of Alexandria (...) and Eusebius of Caesarea (...) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD1 and 1BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1BC (historians do not use a year zero), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years [...] "since the Incarnation" [...] implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and Nativity in AD1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>we</b> now label 2BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC, deriving this from the chronology of Herod the Great, his son Philip the Tetrarch, and the daughter of Augustus, Julia. Having read Suslyga's work, Kepler noted that Christ was born during the reign of King Herod the Great (–), whose death he placed in 4BC. Kepler chose this year because Josephus stated that a lunar eclipse occurred shortly before Herod's death. John Pratt of the International Planetarium Society proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse. According to Josephus, Herod died in the year 4 or 3BC.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{was born}} in Cambridge, Wisconsin. He made an {{agreement}} with his father, Roy, that Roy should buy a car and race, and Matt would work on the car until {{he was old enough}} to race. Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither of us knew much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar chassis manufacturer just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. My dad and I had some major discussions at the end of <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>We</b> had to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling before they started winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E
