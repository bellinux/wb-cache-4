5|$|After {{ten years}} as the vicar, Wheelwright was {{suspended}} in 1633 following his attempt to sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> Instead of procuring the necessary funds, {{he was convicted of}} simony (selling church offices), and completely removed from his office. After his removal from Bilsby he was likely in Laceby in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized. He then preached for a short while at Belleau, Lincolnshire, but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions, and began making plans for his emigration from England. Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife, her mother Susanna Hutchinson, and his five living children.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under King Kamehameha IV declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Many Native Hawaiians and Hawaiʻi-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of. Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery.|$|E

5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular export <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England,</b> which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US trotting horses.|$|E
5|$|Early on September14, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across the Deep South, before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September15. Operationally, {{it was considered}} the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted telegraph services in the region. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England.</b> Rough seas {{along the coast of}} New Jersey washed the schooner Willie ashore.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daisy {{brought the}} worst {{flooding}} <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> since Hurricane Diane in 1955.

While located {{a short distance from}} the Leeward Islands, the depression curved northwestward and began intensifying. On October2, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Daisy. Around that time, the storm turned back to the west-northwest and continued to deepen. Daisy reached hurricane status late on October3. Two days later, it became a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, but briefly weakened back to a Category1 on October6.|$|E

50|$|Molasses and rum {{were common}} in <b>New</b> <b>England</b> cuisine, due <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>England's</b> {{involvement}} in the Triangle Trade in the 18th century.
