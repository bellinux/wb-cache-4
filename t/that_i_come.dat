Matheos would send Moore guitar, keyboard and programming parts; Moore would then [...] "chop them up and stuff".

[...] "With Kevin it's much more collaborative in <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> up with a song idea and it can change completely from my original idea to the final product on the record." ...|$|E

Then {{she said she was}} poor--and to tell 'ee the plain truth she looked like it-- an' she wanted the pup so bad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> down to five." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. It {{was because}} of these things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down here--because of them almost <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to England. I've always liked to think of them," [...] said my companion.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{only for}} a week, and that my week was over.|$|R
60|$|Then it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{out from}} behind my curtain and groped my way towards them.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yet once again," [...] {{said the}} Eastern sage, after the periphrastical manner of his countrymen, [...] "supposing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{not as a}} friend?" ...|$|E
60|$|Object. 3. But I cannot believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to Christ aright, because {{sometimes}} I am apt to question his very being and office to save.|$|E
