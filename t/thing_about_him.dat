500|$|McGregor was a {{committed}} Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped {{for forty years}} at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> [...] "was {{not so much the}} genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all". He described him as [...] "a man of absolutely unblemished personal character".|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{stated that}} his {{relationship}} with Harrison was [...] "one of young follower and older guy... was like a disciple of mine when we started." [...] The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming {{to the conclusion that}} people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: [...] "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a bastard – but that's the great <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> you see?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a media {{interview}} Spurs {{head coach}} Gregg Popovich commented, [...] "(Hill) does {{a little bit}} of everything, the great <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> is that he's a very good all around basketball player, he's a tenacious defender, he can score, he can run, he's a good passer, he knows how to play and he's really a team guy". When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill responded by picking Monta Ellis, adding that he sees himself as a combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes. Hill was drafted by the Spurs to back up All-Star Tony Parker at point guard.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, ScrewAttack ranked Shao Kahn as {{the fourth}} best Mortal Kombat character. On the other hand, GamePlayBook ranked {{him as the}} fourth worst Mortal Kombat character, criticizing him for looking like [...] "he failed WWE {{training}} camp". Even having fellow MK character Johnny Cage make a joke about his appearance in MK9. In UGO's 2012 list of the top Mortal Kombat characters, Shao Kahn placed as 16th. In their retrospection listing of MK characters, UGO stated most favorite <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{was the fact that}} [...] "his speaking voice is the voice of the announcer heard throughout the series." [...] Complex placed him seventh on her 2013 list of most brutal fighters in Mortal Kombat, adding that [...] "he was brutal not only in his strength but his cunning, too." [...] He was voted the series' ninth greatest character in a poll by Dorkly that same year.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{review of}} {{the first six months}} of 2010 in British soap operas, Ruth Deller from lowculture.co.uk wrote about Leon, [...] "As someone who didn't watch E20 and {{therefore}} has no idea what backstory, if any, these characters had, Leon is probably the worst of the new gang – no family on the square, no distinctive personality, no plotline beyond impregnating Lucy Beale. The most interesting <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> was when it looked like Peter Beale had run him over , and even that turned out to be nothing. [...] can't say eon will be missed." [...] A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Leon, along with Fatboy and Zsa Zsa, brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters. In May 2010, Attwater received a nomination in the [...] "Best Soap Newcomer" [...] category at the 14th TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Leon.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 {{interview}} with NPR's Terry Gross on her program Fresh Air, Haddon said about Christopher, [...] "If he were diagnosed, {{he would be}} diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, which {{is a form of}} autism. I suppose you'd call it high-function autism in that he can function on, you know, a day-to-day basis, in a kind of rudimentary way. But he has a serious difficulty with life in that he really doesn't empathize with other human beings. He can't read their faces. He can't put himself in their shoes. And he can't understand anything more than the literal meaning of whatever's said to him, although I'm very careful in the book not to actually use the word 'Asperger's' or 'autism.' ... Because I don't want him to be labelled, and because, as with most people who have a disability, I don't think it's necessarily the most important <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him...</b> And as {{a good friend of mine}} said after reading the book, a friend who is himself a mathematician, it's not a novel about a boy who has Asperger's syndrome; it's a novel about a young mathematician who has some strange behavioural problems. And I think that's right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mind me," [...] said Mr. Stokes, glancing balefully {{over at his}} {{agitated}} friend. [...] "P'raps I'll {{tell you}} some <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{there is}} no harm in that. For aught he knows, you may be saying the most unkind <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about this man. Anyhow, I only know two <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> One is, he has never been in jail, and the other is, I don't know why." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the great}} tragic Shakespearean roles, however, Tree was overshadowed by earlier actors such as Henry Irving. [...] During performance, Tree allowed {{inspiration}} {{to suggest to}} him appropriate stage business, which sometimes lead to inconsistent interpretations in his portrayals of a role. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "The wonderful <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> was his amazing versatility, {{and there was an}} intellectual virility, an untiring earnestness about the man, which was irresistibly stimulating." [...] Tree's versatility, however, was a two edged sword: he quickly tired of characters after a brief run and sought to add business and details to the part to sustain his interest, which led to further character inconsistencies in long runs. [...] Tree's voice was described as thin, and he was sometimes criticised for struggling to project it in a manner that made his performance seem unnatural. [...] In the last decade of his career, Tree's technique was seen as mannered and old fashioned. [...] His spectacles, too, in comparison with the experimental methods of Poel and other producers, seemed outdated, although Tree responded to his critics by noting that his productions remained profitable and well attended.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dr Colman sharply; [...] "the fact is, Mr Grant, my {{discovery}} is {{of a different}} character. The awful <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyway, he {{was very}} fine to look upon, was Mr. Meadow Mouse, and not the least {{attractive}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> was his beautiful, long, slim tail, of which {{he was very}} proud.|$|E
60|$|The {{door closed}} upon him. The bishop was alone. He {{was flooded with}} {{the light of the}} world that is beyond this world. The <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> became very small and indistinct.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} to be saying all these nice <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> now," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "He won't ever know how much we thought of him. It's too late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. The Old Man's been {{finding out}} <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> apparently, and this smoking row has just added the finishing-touch to his discoveries. He's {{particularly}} keen against smoking just {{now for some}} reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{he entered}} the stable, Mose found Reynolds looking {{carefully}} at Jack. [...] "That looks a gentle horse; I can't see a mean <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I don't reckon he's a cow hoss, is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Trot {{looked the}} boy over carefully. She didn't see any wings on him. The only queer <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> was his big umbrella. [...] "Oh!" [...] she said suddenly, {{clapping}} her hands together. [...] "I know now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, we {{can easily}} settle one <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> at any rate. Here comes Claire. Claire, old girl,' she said, {{as the door}} opened, 'do you know a man named--Darn it! I never got his name, but he's--' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell me {{what you}} wrote," [...] he bade me his eyes resting on my face with a new look of interest, for his love of letters {{was one of the}} few <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that was not affected.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a good colour," [...] {{said the}} friend, looking {{critically}} at the supposed kitten, {{who was sitting}} up on his haunches combing his whiskers, and saying the only truthfully pleasant <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that she could think of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had he any <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> of {{the look}} and way of a sailor?" [...] she asked. [...] "And did you notice, when you spoke to him, {{that he had a}} habit of playing with a locket on his watch-chain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Him? Oh, nobody 'specially. He's just {{a fellow}} down here at Schoenstrom. But {{we all know}} him.

6000|$|... 'I {{can help}} you some too, I guess. I used to know Winfield Knight. I can put you wise on lots of <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that'll help you work up Willie's {{character}} so's it'll fit him like a glove.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So he would, the scoundrel! This {{is a hard}} {{world for}} honest men. Now, you admit Abdullah is a cad. Listen to me, and I'll tell you a few more <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He was, etc., etc. He is, etc., etc.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If I had 11 Dexter Reids, wed be {{the best}} defense in the country. I cant say enough good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> He is an {{all-around}} football player and brings great leadership to our defense." [...] Former UNC defensive coordinator Dave Huxtable.|$|R
60|$|Striped Chipmunk, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, and Danny Meadow Mouse {{looked as}} though they felt very foolish, as indeed they did. You see, all their lives Miner the Mole {{had been one of}} their nearest neighbors, and yet they didn't know the first <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The funniest <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{is the way}} {{he likes}} to grow-- [...] Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow; [...] For he {{sometimes}} shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, [...] And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Dan did it, {{and gave}} the money to you.

60|$|Gradually a great, {{helpless}} sorrow {{was rising}} in him. But as {{yet he was}} fighting it away, he was struggling for his own life. He became very quiet and unaware of the <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> awaiting, as it were, her judgment on him.|$|R
