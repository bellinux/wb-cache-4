5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E

5|$|The film grossed a {{total of}} US$941,610 in Japan. Its home media release had {{positive}} sales in Japan, with the Blu-ray {{being one of the}} bestselling from the year it was released. Critical reception of the film has been generally positive for its accessibility to the non-gamers of Tales of Vesperia as well as <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main cast and the production value. Nevertheless, it has also attracted criticism for its slow pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Air {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three female main characters by the player character.

The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Air has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.|$|E

5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the silhouette of a small fish from below. <b>The</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog. Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large part of <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, {{as well as more}} difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin and sports games such as Joe Montana Football. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Little Busters! {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six female main characters by the player character, which increases to nine in Ecstasy. There are additional minigames added into the gameplay, such as battle sequences that resemble fighting games or baseball batting practice, which serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during battle, and improve their statistics. Both Little Busters! and Ecstasy ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for {{the time of their}} release, and Ecstasy would go on to sell over 100,000 units. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off called Kud Wafter in June 2010, which expanded on the scenario of Kudryavka Noumi, one of the heroines from Little Busters! and Ecstasy.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Otoboku {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six female main characters by the player character.

Caramel Box went on to produce two fan discs released in 2005 and 2007 in Caramel Box Yarukibako and Caramel Box Yarukibako 2, respectively. Caramel Box later produced a sequel to Otoboku titled Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder released on June 30, 2010 playable on Windows PCs. Futari no Elder was ported to the PSP with the adult content removed. The story follows Chihaya Kisakinomiya, an androgynous male, who transfers into the all-girls school that was the setting of Otoboku.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Tomoyo After {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title character Tomoyo. Being a spin-off of Clannad, where Tomoyo {{is one of the}} game's heroines, Tomoyo After provides an expansion of Tomoyo's story after the events of Clannad and is written by Jun Maeda and Leo Kashida. The art was done by Fumio, as opposed to Itaru Hinoue who had done the art in Clannad. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more afterwards. A manga adaptation illustrated by Yukiko Sumiyoshi, under the title Tomoyo After: Dear Shining Memories, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's Dragon Age Pure in 2007. Unlike the game which is told from Tomoya's point of view, the manga is told from Tomoyo's perspective. A single tankōbon volume was released in Japan in December 2007.|$|E

Vizzini had tried hard to persuade Pantaleone to marry his niece but failed. Pantaleone used his leverage with the left wing press. In return Don Calò arranged for the crops on Pantaleone family’s land to be vandalized. There was even a failed attempt on Pantaleone’s life.|$|E
