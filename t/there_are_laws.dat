2500|$|Gary Francione, {{professor}} of law and philosophy at Rutgers Law School in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that paradigm shift. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> that seem to reflect those concerns, [...] "in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." [...] The law only requires that any suffering not be [...] "unnecessary". In deciding what counts as [...] "unnecessary", an animal's interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.|$|E

In early 2010, the city of Detroit banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008. The city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties but kept other restrictions. Both cities were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity linked to its striptease establishments. For some jurisdictions, even certain postures can be considered [...] "indecent" [...] (such as spreading the legs).|$|E
2500|$|Some of the North American petroform shapes {{are over}} 2,500 years old. [...] It is {{difficult}} to date all of them accurately {{because of a lack}} of soil deposits in some areas.

[...] Some teachings may have been lost, along with the peoples that originally made some of the oldest petroforms in North America. [...] In some North American states and provinces, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> to protect these important archaeological and historical sites.

2500|$|The Canada Health Act of 1984 [...] "does not {{directly}} bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," [...] but provides financial disincentives for doing so. [...] "Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> prohibiting or curtailing private {{health care in}} some provinces, they can be changed," [...] {{according to a report}} in the New England Journal of Medicine. Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. [...] Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for time-sensitive surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the Canadian Supreme Court in its 2005 ruling in Chaoulli v. Quebec, waiting list delays [...] "increase the patient’s risk of mortality or the risk that his or her injuries will become irreparable." [...] The ruling found that a Quebec provincial ban on private health insurance was unlawful, because it was contrary to Quebec's own legislative act, the 1975 Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
2500|$|A club {{might also}} hire or {{broadcast}} forms of entertainment other than striptease (such as pay-per-view events), {{for which it}} earns revenue via premium fees. [...] Some clubs have also moved into providing chat and broadcast services via the internet, including live video feeds. Beyond this more passive entertainment, some clubs' dancers offer additional services, such as lap dances or trips to the champagne room, for a set fee rather than for tips. [...] This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a fixed amount of time. Lap dances may also be offered during lingerie modeling sessions. [...] During a lap dance, the dancer rubs against the customer's crotch while he or she remains clothed, {{in an attempt to}} arouse or bring the recipient to climax. Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities, however, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. In some parts of the U.S., <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> forbidding the exposure of female nipples, and thus dancers must cover their nipples with pasties to comply with those laws.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success in the job market. [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 percent more likely to be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and makes it harder to traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> against this type of discrimination, such as America's Title XII of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E
2500|$|French {{anthropologist}} Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralist anthropology {{brought together}} ideas of Boas (especially Boas's {{belief in the}} mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's Émile Durkheim's focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. [...] His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing {{members of the same}} society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people are aware). [...] He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. [...] He argued that just as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>laws</b> through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. [...] The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural [...] "table of elements," [...] and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures. [...] Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.|$|E
