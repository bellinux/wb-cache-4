5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} decided that Arthur {{would not go}} to prison for stealing the Christmas club money, until a legal advisor to the programme suggested that EastEnders would not be portraying a likely outcome. In reality he would probably get twenty-eight days in prison, so that others could be taught a lesson, and so <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> on-screen. The episode where Arthur was sent to prison was written by Bill Lyons, and dominated by Arthur's trial. A special court set had to be hired, {{but it was too}} large to fit into the regular EastEnders studio at Elstree, and needed an extra studio. The episode cut {{back and forth between the}} trial and the regular goings-on in the Square before climaxing with the shock decision of the judge, who told Arthur that, as he had betrayed people's trust he must be seen to be punished, and she sentenced him to twenty-eight days.|$|E
2500|$|Further, Chinese {{arms are}} {{basically}} low cost items, sold {{in large quantities}} for relatively low costs: machetes, low-priced assault rifles like the Type 56, or the QLZ87 grenade launcher. These items have a far lower value than a single jetfighter or attack helicopter sold by the US but can kill far more people. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> during the 1994 Rwanda genocide, with large quantities of [...] "Made in China" [...] machetes. Those [...] "light weapons", when supplied in large quantities, become a tool of mass destruction.|$|E

2500|$|Dia often {{recorded}} a [...] "song diary," [...] an impromptu recorded song, on her MySpace page. She explained, [...] "It {{was something very}} raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with many." ...|$|E
2500|$|ESPN writer Alyssa Roenigk {{summed up}} the event:If {{thoughts}} and emotions produce energy and that energy can alter an atmosphere, if the power of smiles and hugs and [...] "good afternoons" [...] and [...] "be wells" [...] can build and build until all that positivity overflows to change the molecules of air within a basketball arena, then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> inside the Cintas Center on Sunday. The building overflowed with positive vibes, and that emotion was infectious. This day was not about basketball. It was not about a game. This was a celebration of life and a community coming together to support one girl and two teams as they banded together to beat up on cancer.|$|E

25|$|In the Sumerian {{version of}} the flood myth, {{the causes of the}} flood and the reasons for the hero's {{survival}} are unknown {{due to the fact that}} the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, Samuel Noah Kramer has stated that it can probably <b>be</b> reasonably inferred <b>that</b> the hero Ziusudra survives due to Enki's aid because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} The Sky is Falling {{comes from a}} child's {{misinterpretation}} of the Blitz. Early in the novel, Norah and Gavin are listening to stories with other evacuees.

A young evacuee states <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in England.|$|R

60|$|Time, mercifully, {{generally}} {{breaks up}} a big stand at cricket before the field has suffered too much, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> now. At four o'clock, when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket, Barnes, greatly daring, smote lustily at a rather wide half-volley and was caught at short-slip for thirty-three. He retired blushfully to the pavilion, amidst applause, and Stone came out.|$|E
60|$|Yet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> The figure perceptibly gave up its fixity, shifted {{a step or}} two, {{and turned}} round. As if alarmed, it descended {{on the right side}} of the barrow, with the glide of a water-drop down a bud, and then vanished. The {{movement}} had been sufficient to show more clearly the characteristics of the figure, and that it was a woman's.|$|E

5000|$|Michael: A German Destiny in Diary Form (...) is a semi-autobiographical novel {{authored}} by the German propagandist Joseph Goebbels {{and published in}} 1929. It is a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived. The novel {{is a combination of}} Goebbels' own thoughts and the life of his best friend Richard Flisges who had actually fought in World War I, and later ended his college studies to work in a mine where he died in an accident. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the novel's protagonist Michael who meets his [...] "sacrificial death" [...] on 30 January 1921.|$|R

60|$|You will ask, what value {{could this}} scheme have, since {{the secrets of}} the confessional are sacred and cannot be revealed? True--but suppose another person should overhear them?

Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> Cauchon had {{previously}} caused a hole to be bored through the wall; and he stood with his ear to that hole and heard all. It is pitiful to think of these things. One wonders how they could treat that poor child so. She had not done them any harm.|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. Yes, {{when she}} is in pursuit of me. She runs faster and faster. I run slower and slower. And these woods of yours are full of magic. There was a confounded fern owl.

Did you ever hear it call its mate by {{striking}} its wings together twice and whistling that single note that no nightingale can imitate? <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in the woods when I was running away.

5000|$|Though {{the film}} was {{specifically}} made for Japanese television, Kurosawa shot it on film.

[...] He claims that he [...] "shot it as a film," [...] and that working for television was not particularly different from his usual work style except that, [...] "The only thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I couldn't use shocking scenes.

5000|$|In the morning, {{the doors}} of those arrested were sealed; the wives and {{children}} had to move to other quarters and were ostracized as [...] "enemies of the state". The children of parents under investigation were placed in orphanages, where some died from illness and others rejected both their parents and their own German identity. Some of the adults arrested were sent to a gulag or were executed. Those who came back were regarded with suspicion, {{as was the case}} with Herbert Wehner, who was taken away and returned twice. Such people were assumed to have betrayed others under torture or to save themselves. In Wehner's case, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “It is {{not when}} any one dies {{in the castle}} that the howling is heard.

There were only a few couple of wolves that had their lairs in this part of the forest, but at such a time the keepers say there would be scores of them, gliding about in the shadows and howling in chorus, and the dogs of the castle and the village and all the farms round would bay and howl in fear and anger at the wolf chorus, and as the soul of the dying one left its body a tree would crash down in the park. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> when a Cernogratz died in his family castle.
