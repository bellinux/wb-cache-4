5|$|There {{had already}} been public debate {{on the fate of}} retired cricketers, and {{counties}} had improved pay and conditions for their professional players. For example, several counties, including Yorkshire, had instituted winter pay before Pullin's writings were published. However, former players did not benefit from <b>these</b> <b>reforms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. <b>These</b> <b>reforms</b> included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E

5|$|Against all <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> {{were the}} nobles of Wessex, who {{included}} most of Dunstan's own relatives, {{and who had}} an interest in maintaining established customs. For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and Crediton in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.|$|E
5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera was {{denounced as}} 'feudalistic' and 'bourgeois' during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, and {{replaced}} with the eight revolutionary model operas {{as a means of}} propaganda and indoctrination. After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. In recent years, Peking opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers. <b>These</b> <b>reforms,</b> which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, in England, Euclid's Elements was still the {{standard}} textbook in secondary schools. The traditional treatment of geometry was being pressured to change by the new developments in projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry, so several new textbooks for the teaching of geometry were written at this time. A major difference between <b>these</b> <b>reform</b> texts, both between themselves and between them and Euclid, is the treatment of parallel lines. <b>These</b> <b>reform</b> texts were not without their critics and one of them, Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), wrote a play, Euclid and His Modern Rivals, in which these texts are lambasted.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>reformed</b> {{calendars}} generally {{remained in}} use until the fifth or sixth century. Around that time {{most of them}} were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, but with a year starting in September to reflect the year of the indiction cycle.|$|R
5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC. They {{attempted}} to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major aristocratic landholdings among the urban poor and veterans, {{in addition to other}} reform measures. After achieving some early success, both were assassinated by enemies of <b>these</b> <b>reforms.</b>|$|E
5|$|With <b>these</b> <b>reforms,</b> kings {{were reduced}} to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a {{personal}} income from {{only a portion of}} the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal nature of <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, {{but with the}} support of religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E

5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of <b>these</b> <b>reforms,</b> forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to revaluate {{the roles of the}} {{reformed}} local autonomy for promoting decentralization and local autonomy against new centralization. I consider the local autonomy and finance in Japan after World War II, focussing on the roles of so called 'Kakushin Jichitai', reformed local autonomy in the 1960 's and 1970 's. Firstly I review the developing and declining processes of 'reformed local autonomy' in the period of high economic growth in Japan. Then I discuss the roles of <b>these</b> <b>reformed</b> local government bodies through rising citizen movements. The local governments like Minobe-Tosei or Asukata-Yokohama-Shisei contributed to the tax reforms and some other financial reforms and promoting decentralization. The 1960 's and 1970 's in Japan are called 'The Period of New Centralization' in intergovernmental relations. However, the roles of <b>these</b> <b>reformed</b> local autonomy for promoting decentralization against new centralization should be revaluated...|$|R

5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. <b>These</b> <b>reforms</b> remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E
5|$|Philip II {{spent his}} initial years radically {{transforming}} the Macedonian army. A reform of its organization, equipment, and training, including {{the introduction of}} the Macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes (i.e. the sarissa), proved immediately successful when tested against his Illyrian and Paeonian enemies. Confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much PhilipII's royal predecessors may have contributed to <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> {{and the extent to which}} his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in Thebes as a political hostage during the Theban hegemony, especially after meeting with the general Epaminondas.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} Pretoria in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{crisis of}} his early reign, the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), led to the First Partition of Poland (1772). The latter part of his reign saw reforms wrought by the Great Sejm (1788–1792) and the Constitution of 3 May 1791. <b>These</b> <b>reforms</b> were overthrown by the 1792 Targowica Confederation and by the War in Defense of the Constitution, leading directly to the Second Partition of Poland (1793), the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) and the final Third Partition of Poland (1795), marking {{the end of the}} Commonwealth. Stripped of all meaningful power, Poniatowski abdicated in November 1795 and spent the last years of his life in semi-captivity in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} role of {{the private}} sector forms an important trend in the ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since <b>these</b> <b>reforms</b> most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by private firms. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size. Since this time private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.|$|E

The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. <b>These</b> <b>reforms</b> included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.|$|E
