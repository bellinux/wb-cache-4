The superiority of green light over red in terms of the illumination time required to produce equivalent depths of necrosis may extend to greater depths (3 - 4 mm) if the former is produced by an argon laser and the latter by an argon-pumped dye laser.

40|$|The {{height of}} Japanese youth {{raised in the}} {{northern}} region tends to be {{greater than that of}} youth raised in the southern region; therefore, a geographical gradient in youth body height exists. Although this gradient has existed for about 100 years, the reasons for it remain unclear. Consideration of the nutritional improvement, economic growth, and intense migration that has occurred in this period indicates that it is probably the result of environmental rather than nutritional or genetic factors. To identify possible environmental factors, ecological analysis of prefecture-level data on the body size of 8 - to 17 -year-old youth averaged over a 13 -year period (1996 to 2008) and Japanese mesh climatic data on the climatic variables of temperature, solar radiation, and effective day length (duration of photoperiod exceeding <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of <b>light</b> intensity) was performed. The geographical distribution of the standardized height of Japanese adolescents was found to be inversely correlated to a great extent with the distribution of effective day length at a light intensity greater than 4000 lx. The results of multiple regression analysis of effective day length, temperature, and weight (as an index of food intake) indicated that a combination of effective day length and weight was statistically significant as predictors of height in early adolescence; however, only effective day length was statistically significant as a predictor of height in late adolescence. Day length may affect height by affecting the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that inhibits sexual and skeletal maturation, which in turn induces increases in height. By affecting melatonin production, regional differences in the duration of the photoperiod may lead to regional differences in height.

The toxicity of IP-PDT and the effects of IP-PDT on abdominal and pelvic organs, particularly the small intestine, were investigated after ALA administration and illumination with violet laser light. Study design and results: The toxicity of IP-PDT was evaluated in Fischer 344 rats in two ways. In {{the first part of the}} study local PDT effects on the intestine were analyzed histologically. Violet laser light (lambda: 406 - 415 nm) was applied as a 2 cm diameter spot on the intestine 3 h after intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of 50 mg/kg ALA. (A) Histological tissue samples were taken 0 min, 6 h and 1, 2 and 3 days after treatment (optical dose 3. 2 J/cm(2)). Immediately after local PDT (3. 2 J/cm(2), 50 mg/kg ALA) showed no effect on the intestine. However, 6 h post PDT there was complete destruction of the mesothelial lining and the outer (longitudinal) smooth muscle. Ganglion cells of the myenteric (Auerbach) plexus were also destroyed. The inner circular smooth muscle, the muscularis mucosa and the lamina propria were unharmed. Marked lymphectasia was present at this time. (B) To determine <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>light</b> dose of tissue destruction caused by PDT, different optical doses (1. 6, 3. 2, 6. 4 J/cm(2)) were administered and histologic analysis of tissue samples were obtained I day post treatment. Destruction of the entire external musculature, submucosal structures and muscularis mucosa of the intestine at the illumination site could be observed above 1. 6 J/cm(2) (50 mg/ka ALA). In the second part of the study whole peritoneal cavity PDT (WPC-PDT) was performed by illumination of the whole peritoneal cavity with 1. 6 j/cm(2) Violet light 3 h after ALA administration using different drug doses (200, 100 and 50 mg/kg). WPC-PDT showed lethal toxicity with a drug dose above 50 mg/kg ALA at 1. 6 j/cm(2). The probable cause of death in the first 3 days after IP-PDT was rhabdomyolysis, whereas when death occurred at longer time intervals, megaintestine associated with significant damage could be observed; however, without perforation of the intestinal wall.

These two tests are most effectively carried out when the amplitudes are expanded in terms of the modified minimal subtraction (M̅S̅) couplings of the standard model. The resulting perturbation expansion is valid at collider energies below and around <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of <b>the</b> <b>light</b> supersymmetric particles. We find that the corrections to the cross section of the longitudinally polarized W-pair production can be as large as - 1. 4...|$|R
