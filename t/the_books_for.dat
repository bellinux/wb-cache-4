By contrast, the Nationalist Government of China responded by banning Townsend's book throughout China from 1935. Even so, the journalist George Moorad reported that in 1946 Chinese communists distributed contraband copies of the book to American China Marines in the hopes of disillusioning them about conditions in China.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

Of these, The Summer of the Great-grandmother (1974) discusses L'Engle's personal experience caring for her aged mother, and Two-Part Invention (1988) is a memoir of her marriage, completed after her husband's death from cancer on September 26, 1986.|$|E

25|$|When the Aleppo Codex was {{complete}} (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual {{tradition in the}} order of its books, similar to the Leningrad Codex, and which also matches the later tradition of Sephardi biblical manuscripts. The Torah and the Nevi'im appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> Ketuvim differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is Books of Chronicles, Psalms, Book of Job, Book of Proverbs, Book of Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Book of Lamentations, Book of Esther, Book of Daniel, and Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah.|$|E
25|$|Sterilization rates under eugenic {{laws in the}} United States {{climbed from}} 1927 until Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942). While Skinner v. Oklahoma did not {{specifically}} overturn Buck v. Bell, it created enough of a legal quandary to discourage many sterilizations. By 1963, sterilization laws were almost wholly out of use, though some remained officially on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> many years. Language referring to eugenics was removed from Virginia's sterilization law, and the current law, passed in 1988 and amended in 2013, only authorizes the sterilization of incompetent patients if a Virginia court finds with clear and convincing evidence the sterilization procedure is medically necessary for the patient.|$|E
25|$|During the French Revolution, the French National Assembly rewrote the {{criminal}} code in 1791, omitting all reference to homosexuality. During the Napoleonic wars, homosexuality was decriminalised in territories coming under French control, {{such as the}} Netherlands {{and many of the}} pre-unification German states, however in Germany this ended with the unification of the country under the Prussian Kaiser, as Prussia had long punished homosexuality harshly. On 6 August 1942, the Vichy government made homosexual relations with anyone under twenty-one illegal as part of its conservative agenda. Most Vichy legislation was repealed after the war– but the anti-gay Vichy law remained on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> four decades until it was finally repealed in August 1982 when the age of consent (15) was again made the same for heterosexual as well as homosexual partners.|$|E

500|$|The {{books have}} been the subject of a number of legal proceedings, {{stemming}} from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high market value of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor Warner Bros. to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the [...] "Harry Potter" [...] domain name, and suing author Nancy Stouffer to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work. Various religious conservatives have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as Wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children, while a number of critics have criticised <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> promoting various political agendas.|$|E
500|$|... "The Red Woman" [...] was {{positively}} received by critics {{who found the}} episode to be a satisfactory launching point for the season, and praising the scenes involving Sansa and Brienne, {{as well as the}} closing reveal with Melisandre, although the Dorne storyline was criticized once again for feeling too abrupt and deviating greatly from <b>the</b> <b>books.</b> <b>For</b> filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series.|$|E

[...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?"

500|$|A manga {{based on}} the Kingdom Hearts storyline has been {{released}} in Japan and the United States. The story and art are done by Shiro Amano, who is also known for his manga adaptation of the Legend of Mana video game. The story follows the events {{that took place in}} the video games with differences to account for the loss of interactivity a video game provides. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square Enix's Monthly Shōnen Gangan and eventually released in tankōbon format. The first tankōbon was released in Japan in October 2003. The manga was released in the USA by Tokyopop two years later in October 2005. Yen Press now holds the rights to publish <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>for</b> the USA market. The first series, Kingdom Hearts, consists of four volumes, while the second series, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, has two volumes. The third series, Kingdom Hearts II, has had five volumes published and is currently on hiatus. A fourth series based on Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is being serialized. The games have also been adapted as a light novel series, written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. Like the manga series, it is divided into separate series {{based on the}} games. Kingdom Hearts is divided into two volumes; [...] "The First Door" [...] and [...] "Darkness Within". Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is divided into two volumes. Kingdom Hearts II is divided into four volumes; [...] "Roxas—Seven Days", [...] "The Destruction of Hollow Bastion", [...] "Tears of Nobody", and [...] "Anthem—Meet Again/Axel Last Stand".|$|E
