50|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> {{is created}} when a tenant wrongfully holds over past {{the end of}} the {{duration}} period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after {{the end of the}} lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such tenant at any time, without notice. Action to evict will terminate a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> (sometimes {{called a}} {{holdover}} tenancy) exists when a tenant remains {{in possession of}} a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property. Although the tenant is technically a trespasser at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognize the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may evict such a tenant at any time, and without notice.|$|E
40|$|The rule is {{that the}} {{necessity}} of a notice to quit is based on the relation of landlord and tenant, and where that relation does not exist, the notice to quit is not necessary. Therefore, it has been held that a mortgagor in possession, is not entitled to notice to quit, as he is 2 ̆ 2 at most a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> and may be treated either as a tenant or trespasser, at the election of the mortgagee. 2 ̆ 2 And no notice to quit is necessary where one has taken possession under an adverse claim. So, where the tenant going into possession of the premises under the title of the landlord, afterwards disclaims, he has no right to insist on a notice to quit. At common law, a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> was not entitled to notice to quit. But it has been provided by statute in some of the States, that it shall be necessary to serve him with notice to quit. It is so provided in Missouri, where one month 2 ̆ 7 s notice is required, and in Wisconsin. But in Michigan, and in Oregon, the statute requires a notice of three months. This provision, requiring notice to be given to tenants <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> has given rise to some troublesome questions...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> will is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate {{at any time}} by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal lease, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>at</b> will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|R
