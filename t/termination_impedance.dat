50|$|Any {{discontinuity}} can {{be viewed}} as a <b>termination</b> <b>impedance</b> and substituted as Zt. This includes abrupt changes in the characteristic impedance. As an example, a trace width on a printed circuit board doubled at its midsection would constitute a discontinuity.

50|$|The {{advantages}} of the method are best understood by comparing it to the filter design methodology that was used before it, the image method. The image method considers the characteristics of an individual filter section in an infinite chain (ladder topology) of identical sections. The filters produced by this method suffer from inaccuracies due to the theoretical <b>termination</b> <b>impedance,</b> the image impedance, not generally being equal to the actual <b>termination</b> <b>impedance.</b> With network synthesis filters, the terminations {{are included in the}} design from the start. The image method also requires a certain amount of experience {{on the part of the}} designer. The designer must first decide how many sections and of what type should be used, and then after calculation, will obtain the transfer function of the filter. This may not be what is required and there can be a number of iterations. The network synthesis method, on the other hand, starts out with the required function and generates as output the sections needed to build the corresponding filter.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the signal}} path has {{impedance}} discontinuity, {{in other words}} an impedance mismatch, then a <b>termination</b> <b>impedance</b> with the equivalent amount of impedance is placed {{at the point of}} line discontinuity.

There are several ways of termination depending on how the resistors are connected to the transmission line. Parallel termination and series termination are examples of termination methodologies.|$|E

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of rO in the hybrid-pi model predicts reverse transmission from the amplifiers output to its input, {{that is the}} amplifier is bilateral. One consequence {{of this is that}} the input/output impedance is affected by the load/source <b>termination</b> <b>impedance,</b> hence, for example, the output resistance Rout may vary over the range rO || RC ≤ Rout ≤ (β + 1) rO || RC, depending on the source resistance RS. The amplifier can be approximated as unilateral when neglect of rO is accurate (valid for low gains and low to moderate load resistances), simplifying the analysis. This approximation often is made in discrete designs, but may be less accurate in RF circuits, and in integrated-circuit designs, where active loads normally are used.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to RS-422, {{which has a}} single driver circuit which cannot be switched off, RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. This allows RS-485 to implement linear bus topologies using only two wires. The equipment located along a set of RS-485 wires are interchangeably called nodes, stations or devices. The recommended arrangement of the wires is as a connected series of point-to-point (multidropped) nodes, i.e. a line or bus, not a star, ring, or multiply connected network. Star and ring topologies are not recommended because of signal reflections or excessively low or high <b>termination</b> <b>impedance.</b> If a star configuration is unavoidable, special RS-485 star/hub repeaters are available which bidirectionally listen for data on each span and then retransmit the data onto all other spans.|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{extension}} to Bartlett's theorem that allows a symmetrical filter network operating between equal input and output <b>impedance</b> <b>terminations</b> to be modified for unequal source and load impedances. This {{is an example of}} impedance scaling of a prototype filter. The symmetrical network is bisected along its plane of symmetry. One half is impedance-scaled to the input impedance and the other is scaled to the output impedance. The response shape of the filter remains the same. This does not amount to an impedance matching network, the impedances looking in to the network ports bear no relationship to the <b>termination</b> <b>impedances.</b> This means that a network designed by Bartlett's theorem, while having exactly the filter response predicted, also adds a constant attenuation in addition to the filter response. In impedance matching networks, a usual design criteria is to maximise power transfer.

It is not the same relative to the actual input voltage which is delivered by the theoretical ideal generator via its load impedance.|$|R

40|$|The {{data rate}} of global on-chip {{interconnects}} (up to 10 mm) {{is limited by}} a large distributed resistance and capacitance. This thesis describes methods to increase the achievable data rate of global on-chip interconnects with minimal chip area and power consumption, while maintaining data integrity. The small RC bandwidth of global interconnects limits the achievable data rate. For highest bandwidth per area, all interconnect dimensions (width, spacing, height and oxide thickness) should be chosen equal and small. The bandwidth can be increased by choosing suitable <b>termination</b> <b>impedances.</b> A capacitive source impedance increases the bandwidth {{by a factor of}} three. In addition, the capacitive source impedance decreases power consumption in the interconnect. A small resistive load impedance also increases the bandwidth by a factor of three and decreases the dynamic power consumption. However, the static power consumption can still be high. In order to maintain data integrity, a low offset sense amplifier is used to restore the low voltage swing at the output of the interconnect to full-swing. Furthermore, differential interconnects are used to be robust against supply noise, substrate noise and crosstalk from crossing interconnects. Crosstalk from neighboring interconnects that run in parallel is canceled with a single twist in every even differential interconnect and a double twist in every uneven differential interconnect. The optimal positions of the twists depend on the <b>termination</b> <b>impedances.</b> A conventional transceiver in 0. 13 μm CMOS with an inverter for both the transmitter and thereceiver, achieves 550 Mb/s/ch over a 10 mm long uninterrupted differential interconnect. Power consumption is 3. 4 pJ/b at 50 % data activity. An alternative transceiver in 0. 13 μm CMOS, presented in this work, achieves 3 Gb/s/ch by using pulse-width pre-emphasis at the transmitter and a low-ohmic load resistance at the receiver. Power consumption is 2 pJ/b at 50 % data activity. Our next improvement is a transceiver in 90 m CMOS that achieves 2 Gb/s/ch by using a capacitive pre-emphasis transmitter and decision feedback equalization at the receiver.
