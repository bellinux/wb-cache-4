5|$|The main rock {{type in the}} {{watershed}} is shale, mainly that of the Hamilton Group. Siltstone and sandstone are also found in {{the watershed}}, in the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation and the Onondaga and Old Port Formations. The <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation occurs on the southern side of the watershed and also in the northeastern corner of it. The Onondaga and Old Port Formations occur in the lowest reaches of the watershed and the Hamilton Group occurs everywhere else. 80 percent of the watershed's rock is of the Hamilton Group, 15 percent is of the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation, and 5 percent is of the Onondaga and Old Port Formations.|$|E
5|$|In the upland {{parts of}} the {{watershed}} of Mahoning Creek, 95 percent of the rock is sedimentary rock, mainly of the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The Catskill Formation occurs in a large area in the northeastern part of the watershed and the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation occurs {{in the rest of}} the northern part of the watershed and in the southernmost part of the watershed. The Hamilton Group is to the south of the northern area of the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation and to the north of the southern area of the formation. The Onondaga and Old Port Formation occurs south of the Hamilton Group and near Sechler Run, as does the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation. The Wills Creek Formation is found in the central part of the watershed, as is the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation. The Clinton Group occurs south of these formations and south of the Clinton Group is more of the aforementioned formations.|$|E
500|$|Although one {{previous}} attempt {{had been}} made to regularly review British children's books it was not as comprehensive, did not last as long, and was not nearly as influential as <b>Trimmer's</b> Guardian. Grenby suggests, for example, that Godwin changed the name of his Bible Stories to Sacred Histories after <b>Trimmer's</b> attack on it and the publishers of John Newbery's Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls immediately removed the material Trimmer found offensive. Other scholars have argued that authors wrote with <b>Trimmer's</b> reviewing criteria in mind, one {{going so far as to}} call it [...] "a manual for prospective writers". However, <b>Trimmer's</b> reviews were not always heeded; for example, her negative review of the sentimental works of Edward Augustus Kendall, such as Keeper's Travels in Search of His Master, did little to dampen the sales of his works.|$|R

5|$|The {{rock in the}} {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation. This consists of siltstone and shale and comes from the Devonian period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone and also comes from the Devonian. The Huntley Mountain Formation can be found at the headwaters of the creek. This formation consists of sandstone and siltstone and comes from the Mississippian and Devonian periods.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the <b>Trimmers</b> Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E

5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and <b>trimmers</b> to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E
25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case <b>trimmers</b> are available. Die-based <b>trimmers</b> {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual <b>trimmers</b> usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting bit at the {{opposite}} end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case <b>trimmers</b> are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|E
25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String <b>trimmers</b> powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string <b>trimmers</b> typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Robert Raikes, Trimmer {{also became}} {{active in the}} Sunday school movement, {{founding}} the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She {{and two of the}} ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood. Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend <b>Trimmer's</b> Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them". <b>Trimmer's</b> schools became so well known and admired that Raikes, <b>Trimmer's</b> initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even Queen Charlotte asked <b>Trimmer's</b> advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.|$|R
500|$|Aileen Fyfe, a {{historian}} {{interested in the}} relationship between science and religion, has argued that <b>Trimmer's</b> text, although inspired by Barbauld's books, differs dramatically from Barbauld's in its religious orientation. Barbauld was a Dissenter and more inclined, according to Fyfe, to [...] "encourage curiosity, observation, and reasoning". In contrast, Trimmer, as a high church Anglican, depicted nature as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] and as a reflection not only of God's divinity but also of his goodness. These beliefs are reflected even {{in the structure of the}} text; <b>Trimmer's</b> aim was to convey a sense of the awe, therefore her text does not progress in an orderly fashion through a study of the natural world. Barbauld's texts, however, emphasize the slow accumulation of knowledge as well as logical thinking. Thus Evenings at Home, which she co-wrote with her brother, John Aikin, has a [...] "systematic structure". Another difference between the two writers lies in the role of authority: whereas Barbauld's texts and those she wrote with her brother, emphasize dialogues between teacher and pupil, <b>Trimmer's</b> textual conversations, Fyfe notes, were [...] "controlled by the parent".|$|R
