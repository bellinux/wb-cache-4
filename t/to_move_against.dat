In August 1943, elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, {{only to find the}} island deserted by the Japanese. It was later discovered that the Japanese had withdrawn their 5,000-soldier garrison during the night of 28 July, under cover of fog.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's {{appeal for}} Soviet support split the {{government}} and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E

5|$|As Erica moved {{towards the}} south and {{subsequently}} to the north, the cyclone strengthened, becoming equivalent to a tropical storm according to the JTWC by 1500UTC on 5 March. Erica later attained maximum sustained winds of 105km/h (65mph 1-minute sustained). However the system began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> {{the direction of the}} wind shear environment, and it lost much of its organization. On 7 March at 2230UTC, Erica lost cyclone status and degenerated into a tropical low. The remnant circulation moved slowly to the northeast, and the wind shear conditions abated. As a result, Erica began to gain some signs of organization. At this time the remnants moved towards the southeast {{as a result of an}} upper-level trough developing over Australia.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering more men as they went, the Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands {{that belonged to the}} Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> the Yorkist king.|$|E
5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally {{spilled over into}} open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E

50|$|That evening, under {{pressure}} from his aggressive subordinate generals <b>to</b> <b>move</b> decisively <b>against</b> the French, Kutuzov finally made plans for an offensive, but he firmly forbade his commanders from executing the attack until daylight on November 17, which meant the French would have the entire evening to evacuate Krasny unharrassed by the Russians.|$|R
5|$|Unaware that Humbert had {{surrendered}} and {{the rebellion}} been defeated, the French prepared a follow-up expedition {{under the command}} of Commodore Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart. Three thousand men were embarked aboard the ship of the line Hoche and eight frigates, the force departing Brest on 16 September. However, having missed Savary's frigate squadron, the Royal Navy were more watchful; roving frigate patrols cruised off the principal French ports and in the approaches to Ireland, while squadrons of battleships from the Channel Fleet sailed nearby, ready <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> any new invasion force. In command of the squadron on the Irish station was Commodore Sir John Borlase Warren, a highly experienced officer (and politician) who had {{made a name for himself}} raiding the French coast early in the war.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|By May 1247, as-Salih Ayyub was {{master of}} Syria south of Lake Homs, having gained control over Banyas and Salkhad. With his fellow Ayyubid opponents subdued, except for Aleppo under an-Nasir Yusuf, as-Salih Ayyub {{undertook}} a limited offensive against the Crusaders, sending Fakhr ad-Din <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> their territories in the Galilee. Tiberias fell on 16 June, followed by Mount Tabor and Kawkab al-Hawa soon thereafter. Safad with its Templar fortress {{seemed out of}} reach, so the Ayyubids marched south to Ascalon. Facing stubborn resistance from the Crusader garrison, an Egyptian flotilla was sent by as-Salih Ayyub to support the siege and on 24 October, Fakhr ad-Din's troops stormed through a breach in the walls and killed or captured the entire garrison. The city was razed and left deserted.|$|E

5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Phát and Đức.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his victory}} against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, {{which he did}} on 13 October. He {{returned}} two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, {{only to have the}} pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al-Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte. Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.|$|E

5|$|In the east, the North Koreans {{advanced}} {{immediately after}} taking Taejon. Four North Korean divisions split up {{and approached the}} UN lines along separate routes. The NK 15th Division was the first <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> the US 25th Infantry in the Battle of Sangju on July 20, where the division's US 24th Infantry would be quickly pushed back by the North Korean advance. In the meantime, the NK 3rd Division engaged the newly arrived US 1st Cavalry at the Battle of Yongdong on July 22, where that division would also perform poorly. The NK 6th Division moved further south, where it would confront the US 29th Infantry Regiment at the Hadong Ambush on July 27, effectively destroying one of the regiment's battalions. The US units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against North Korean units, as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued the UN forces {{at this stage of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisions}} {{remained in}} effect for three years; at one point Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Ieven joined forces with Montfort. It was not until 1261 that Henry was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>against</b> the opposition. Receiving a papal annulment of the provisions, he reassumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, Henry's governing deteriorated the situation once more. He failed to reconcile with Montfort, and alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept {{the conditions of the}} provisions. Prince Edward, now firmly {{on the side of his}} father against Montfort, now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up. Cornered, Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX.|$|E
