5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles of communal representation, which led the Tamils {{to realize that they}} were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, no stigma was {{attached}} to the devadasi or to her children, and other members of their caste received them on terms of equality. The children of a devadasi were considered legitimate and devadasis themselves were outwardly indistinguishable from married women of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> Chakyar-s and Nangyaramma-s of Kerala, who performed similar duties, for example, have enjoyed good social status.|$|E

25|$|Many {{lived in}} Protestant or Catholic {{enclaves}} which put them {{within easy reach}} of local paramilitary or community groups. The years 1972–73 saw paramilitary threats from loyalist and republican sources. Of the 288 incidents of intimidation reported, all but twelve were from Protestants who had been threatened from within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> Sometimes this was to gain information or to persuade soldiers to join (or remain within) loyalist organisations. The intimidation included: threatening letters and phone calls, abduction, shots fired from passing cars and off-duty soldiers being assaulted.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{internment}} of Japanese Americans during World War II, historically Japanese areas {{fell into}} disrepair or became adopted by other minority groups (in {{the case of}} Black and Latino populations in Little Tokyo). Boats owned by Japanese Americans were confiscated by the U.S. Navy. One of the vessels owned by a Japanese American, the Alert, built in 1930, became YP-264 in December 1941, and was finally struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2014. When Japanese Americans returned from internment, many settled in neighborhoods where they set up <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> centers in order to feel accepted. Today, many have been renamed cultural centers {{and focus on the}} sharing of Japanese culture with local community members, especially in the sponsorship of Obon festivals.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} Kenya's {{independence}} in August 1963, British officials belatedly realized that the new Kenyan regime {{was not willing to}} give up the Somali-inhabited areas it had just been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what {{came to be known as}} the Shifta War. Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their brethren in Somalia. They have traditionally married within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> and formed a cohesive ethnic network.|$|E

25|$|Churches {{such as the}} Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches {{practice}} closed communion {{under normal}} circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the Holy See judges to be sacramentally {{in the same position}} as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> Some Protestant communities exclude non-members from Communion.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Janus and Vesta {{guarded the}} door and hearth, the Lares {{protected}} the field and house, Pales the pasture, Saturn the sowing, Ceres {{the growth of the}} grain, Pomona the fruit, and Consus and Ops the harvest. Even the majestic Jupiter, the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity and, by his widespread domain, the protector of the Romans in their military activities beyond the borders of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> Prominent in early times were the gods Mars and Quirinus, who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Quirinus is thought by modern scholars to have been the patron of the armed community in time of peace.|$|E
25|$|Runaway slaves (cimarrones) became {{problematic}} {{to public}} order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways. Crown efforts against these groups {{began in earnest}} in the late sixteenth century, but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 {{in the areas of}} Villa Rica, Nueva Veracruz, Antón Lizardo, and the Rio Blanco area. However, the gravest of these occurred in the Orizaba area, where there were about 500 fugitive slaves. In 1609, a leader named Gaspar Yanga led an insurrection against the Spanish but was defeated in battle. Unrest continued, eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the Africans the right to form <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community,</b> exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed. This was called San Lorenzo de Zerral but today it is known as the municipality of Yanga. This was the first time slavery was abolished in the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} {{decision}} to release or raise the child. White adolescents tend {{to give up their}} babies to non-relatives, whereas black adolescents are more likely to receive support from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> in raising the child and also in the form of informal adoption by relatives. Studies by Leynes and by Festinger and Young, Berkman, and Rehr found that for pregnant adolescents, {{the decision to}} release the child for adoption depended on the attitude toward adoption held by the adolescent's mother. Another study found that pregnant adolescents whose mothers had a higher level of education were more likely to release their babies for adoption. Research suggests that women who choose to release their babies for adoption {{are more likely to be}} younger, enrolled in school, and have lived in a two-parent household at age 10, than those who kept and raised their babies.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 2000, the RUC {{was awarded}} the George Cross for bravery, a rare honour which had only been awarded collectively once before, to the island nation of Malta. The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a {{sustained}} and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger – 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of all of those who have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this has brought to them and to their families.|$|E
25|$|The African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem {{is a small}} spiritual {{group of}} African Americans, whose members believe they are descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. With a {{population}} of over 5,000, most members live in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community</b> in Dimona, Israel, with additional families in Arad, Mitzpe Ramon, and the Tiberias area. At {{least some of them}} consider themselves to be Jewish, but mainstream scholarship does not consider them to be of Israelite but of subsaharan African origin. Their ancestors were African Americans who after several years in Liberia migrated to Israel in the late 1960s and demanded that Israel give them citizenship in the state. When Israel refused, they relinquished their United States citizenship and de facto became stateless. After some deliberation the Israeli government granted them citizenship. The African Hebrew Israelites like the Haredim and Israeli Arabs are not required to serve in the military however many do so and they do receive social benefits from the state including free healthcare. Most believe in a kind of Paleo-Judaism based on the Torah without the Oral Laws, however at least one member of the community underwent a conversion to Orthodox Judaism.|$|E

25|$|Eastern Galicia's Ukrainians predominated {{in rural}} areas and were {{primarily}} peasants or priests. Historically, the Ukrainians of eastern Galicia had had an ideological rivalry between Ukrainophiles – people who considered themselves {{to be part of}} the Ukrainian nation – and Russophiles – those who believed that Ukraine was an artificial creation and that Ukrainians were part of the Russian nation. Russophiles dominated western Ukrainian society in the mid 19th century but by the beginning of the First World War had been eclipsed by the Ukrainophiles. No longer widely popular within <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community,</b> the Russophiles depended on support from Russia (such as from the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society based in St. Petersburg) and from Polish aristocrats who used their movement to split Ukrainian society. This support notwithstanding, both Russophiles and Ukrainophiles were opposed to the Poles whom they considered to be historical oppressors. However, the Russophiles were loyal to Russia and hoped that the war would bring about the integration of eastern Galicia with Russia while the Ukrainophiles, in contrast, were loyal to Austria and hoped that the war would bring about a dismemberment of the Russian Empire and the emergence of an independent Ukraine in its territory. Both factions within the Ukrainian community were bitterly opposed to each other.|$|E
25|$|In 1970–71, Catholics made {{up about}} 36% of the {{population}} and about 18% of the UDR. By the end of 1972 the number of Catholics in the UDR had dropped to 3% and never rose above that figure again. There are a number of reasons for this. In {{the early years of the}} conflict, relations soured between the Catholic community and the Army. This was mainly due to incidents such as the Falls Curfew, internment, Bloody Sunday and Operation Motorman. There were also frequent claims of UDR soldiers abusing Catholics at checkpoints and during house searches. Catholic Church and Irish nationalist leaders withdrew their support for the regiment. Many Catholic soldiers left the regiment due to pressure and intimidation from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>community,</b> and the IRA's policy of singling out Catholic soldiers for assassination. Catholics within the regiment also reported being intimidated by Protestant fellow soldiers. Other Catholics resigned in protest at what they saw as the Army's harsh and biased treatment of their community, especially after Operation Demetrius (the introduction of internment). The Belfast Telegraph reported that 25% of the regiment's Catholics resigned in 1971, half of those in the months following Operation Demetrius. By the end of 1972, the vast majority had resigned or simply stopped turning up for duty.|$|E
