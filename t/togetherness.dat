5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of <b>togetherness,</b> SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E

25|$|To {{prepare the}} {{international}} actors for the film, Boyle had the cast undergo method acting. At {{the beginning of}} the film, the characters had been together for sixteen months, so Boyle desired to capture a sense of <b>togetherness</b> among the actors by assigning them to live together. He also enrolled the cast members in space training and scuba diving, as well as watching films together, such as The Right Stuff (1983) and the documentary For All Mankind (1989). Boyle also took the cast on a tour of a nuclear submarine to comprehend claustrophobic living conditions. He also had the cast experience weightlessness in the zero G environment of an acrobatic plane.|$|E

They bonded in world’s of musicality and humanity, resonating between poles of attraction and contention, between, love and opposition. They are inspired by {{the freedom to choose}} and experiment; to travel, carrying their memories, to new places resplendent with the colors of life and humanity. Marcel, Rami, and Bachar Khalife are engaged today in a new journey of <b>togetherness</b> and joint artistic work that began in the year 2000 when both Rami and Bachar joined Al Mayadine Ensemble that Marcel established in the late 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Although {{all four}} images were {{intended}} to promote patriotism {{in a time of}} war, Freedom from Want, which depicts an elderly couple serving a fat turkey to what looks like a table of happy and eager children and grandchildren has given the idyllic Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving work as important a place in the enduring marketplace of promoting family <b>togetherness,</b> peace and plenty as Hallmark at Christmas. [...] Some say that the Four Freedoms were unable {{to live up to the}} role of [...] "illustrating grandiose concepts with humble correlatives" [...] because they are too loud.|$|E
500|$|In a post-match interview, Mourinho {{credited}} Arsenal's defensive {{approach and}} organisation, but felt [...] "the best team lost", arguing that Chelsea created more chances and showed more initiative. He {{went on to}} suggest that Arsenal betrayed their attacking philosophy, choosing to adopt a counterattacking approach. Although Wenger agreed his team were set-up cautiously, he denied they abandoned their playing style: [...] "...we defend our game on <b>togetherness</b> and solidarity and on defending well and attacking well." [...] The Arsenal manager felt victory against Chelsea acted as a physiological boost for his players going into the new season, but was indifferent to his own record of beating Mourinho for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Munch {{experimented with}} {{the motif of}} a couple kissing, both in {{painting}} and woodcuts, as early as 188889. In the numerous realizations of this motif there is a contrast between the world {{inside and outside of}} the room in which the couple is situated. The outside world appears vibrant and lively, whereas the interior of the room is timeless, with the couple frozen in their embrace. In this motif, the couple's abstract form, in which the faces of the two appear to be merged as one, indicates their sense of belongingness and <b>togetherness.</b> Later versions of the motif not only merged their faces, but also their bodies.|$|E

The video is intercut with scenes of lovers experiencing moments of <b>togetherness</b> and closes with a deer wandering the streets. Such a scene, according to the group's first official book Girl Power!, gave them a running gag all throughout the shoot—"Whenever anyone made a mistake it was, 'Oh, deer'." [...] Sometimes, the closing scene would not be shown on television, due to the song fading out to an instrumental, which lasts for 40 seconds.|$|E

500|$|Freedom from Want is {{considered}} one of Rockwell's finest works. Of the four paintings in the Four Freedoms, it is the one most often seen in art books with critical review and commentary. Although all were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, Freedom from Want became a symbol of [...] "family <b>togetherness,</b> peace, and plenty", according to Linda Rosenkrantz, who compares it to [...] "a 'Hallmark' Christmas". Embodying nostalgia for an enduring American theme of holiday celebration, the painting is not exclusively associated with Thanksgiving, and is sometimes known as I'll Be Home for Christmas. [...] The abundance and unity it shows were the idyllic hope of a post-war world, and the image has been reproduced in various formats.|$|E

500|$|The filming {{took place}} in June 2017 at The Confidante, a hotel located in Miami Beach {{that is part of}} the Unbound Collection brand by Hyatt. Hyatt's vice {{president}} of global brands, Sandra Micek, stated that the collaboration between the artist and the hotel made sense to her because [...] " [...] inspiration and its name came from the notion of being a trusted friend". Regarding the shooting, Scholfield commented that the camera was quite near during the dance routines, in order to film more uninterrupted single takes. During an interview with NPR, Lipa commented that, [...] "What I wanted to convey in this video is the unity and <b>togetherness</b> of women supporting each other, helping each other and looking after each other in a situation." [...] The visual premiered through Lipa's YouTube account on 7 July 2017. After this, Hyatt released two behind-the-scenes clips of the shooting.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "New Rules" [...] was {{directed}} by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, [...] "Lost in Your Light". The singer invited Scholfield {{for a cup of}} tea in London in order to discuss her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model Naomi Campbell holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a [...] "reference point", explaining that, [...] "I loved the idea of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, that sense of humility, that sense of strength." [...] Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that [...] "narrative of <b>togetherness</b> and empowerment" [...] into it. Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography. More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.|$|E
500|$|The pay-what-you-want release, {{the first}} for a major act, made {{headlines}} worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. According to Mojo, the release was [...] "hailed as {{a revolution in the}} way major bands sell their music", and the media's reaction was [...] "almost overwhelmingly positive". Time called it [...] "easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business" [...] and Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years." [...] The NME wrote that [...] "the music world seemed to judder several rimes off its axis", and praised the fact that everyone, from fans to critics, had access to the album at the same time on release day: [...] "the kind of moment of <b>togetherness</b> you don’t get very often." [...] Singer Bono of U2 praised Radiohead as [...] "courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Rolling Stones Robert Meltzer {{was impressed}} by the sense of fun and the <b>togetherness</b> of the band, saying it was [...] "the Doors' greatest album" [...] and the best album of the year. Robert Christgau appreciated Morrison's sense of humor in some of the lyrics and believed [...] "the band has never sounded better", although he was disappointed with [...] "Been Down So Long" [...] and [...] "L'America". More recently, Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, described L.A. Woman as [...] "uneven", but noted that the album contains compositions that [...] "rate among their finest and most disturbing work". Sal Cinquemani, reviewing the album for Slant Magazine, considers L.A. Woman to be [...] "the sound of a band in perfect harmony". He describes the Doors' material as [...] "disturbing and cynical over the years, and these songs were no exception". Stephen Dalton of Classic Rock, reviewing the 40th Anniversary Edition of the album, remarks how [...] "the original L.A. Woman still stands proud, an all-time classic journey into bright shining darkness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gridlock" [...] is {{the third}} in a trilogy which began with series one's [...] "The End of the World" [...] and series two's [...] "New Earth". Novice Hame and the green {{crescent}} seen on the mood patches previously appeared in [...] "New Earth". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies wanted to visit the same world each year to maintain a sense of continuity, {{something that could be}} hard to do with Doctor Who formula. Producer Phil Collinson remarked that [...] "Gridlock" [...] displayed Davies' tendency to write about [...] "topical" [...] issues; it is set in a dark dystopian future, but is also a satire on the common traffic jam. While the story is bleak, Davies showed how the Doctor transforms the place by literally opening up the sky and bringing in light. Davies also used hymns to signify hope and a <b>togetherness</b> {{of the members of the}} Motorway. Those on the Motorway sing [...] "The Old Rugged Cross", and the hymn heard at the end of the episode is [...] "Abide with Me". The episode also displays the Doctor's growing attachment to Martha; he feels guilty for lying to her and bringing her to New New York just to show off and realises that he misses her when she is taken.|$|E
500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing <b>togetherness</b> of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their <b>togetherness.</b> The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg's opener against Aston Villa was {{cancelled}} {{out and the}} match ended in a draw, albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference. Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: [...] "We {{want to be a}} team who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. We are just concentrating on expressing our <b>togetherness,</b> our mental strength and our qualities. We have enough players who can win this game." [...] Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arsenal overturned Manchester United's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team. The match ended 2–2; Campbell was sent off for elbowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned the rest of the season, whereas Vieira limped off with an injury. Although the result helped Manchester United move back top, they had played one game more than Arsenal. Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough, but squandered a two-goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes. The result, [...] "a big blow" [...] for Arsenal's title hopes, meant the championship was now in Manchester United's favour.|$|E
500|$|Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham {{threw away}} a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the [...] "Battle of Stamford Bridge". This {{completed}} the fastest seven-year {{rise to the}} title except for Ipswich Town in 1962, and Leicester faced a far more unequal top tier than Ipswich did back then. Bookmakers thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it {{at the start of}} the season. Neither bookmaker had ever paid out such long odds, and the trophy resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25million. The scale of the surprise attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. The Economist declared it would be [...] "pored over for management lessons". Several commentators have viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming the expectations similar sized clubs face in English football. Ranieri's Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, [...] "incredible pace in the areas it is most essential" [...] and defensive solidarity. Players were often praised for their work ethic and <b>togetherness</b> which was apparent throughout the squad. On 16 May 2016, over 240,000 Leicester City fans turned out on the streets of Leicester and Victoria Park to celebrate their team's historic achievement.

500|$|The {{score of}} Chennai Express was {{composed}} by Amar Mohile; the songs were composed by the duo Vishal-Shekhar, and the lyrics {{were written by}} Amitabh Bhattacharya and Yo Yo Honey Singh. Recording of the songs began in late October 2012. The track [...] "Ready Steady Po" [...] was recorded in November 2012 by the music's composers. Several sources said that the director and actor were unsatisfied with the score. The director was reportedly asked to plan for a different musical composition. However, the composers denied these rumours. In mid-April 2013, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title track for the film, marking his return to Bollywood for playback after an absence of fifteen years. He said the song celebrated the spirit of <b>togetherness.</b> Initially, Balasubrahmanyam was apprehensive, but chose to sing due to the content and leads of the film. The song [...] "1 2 3 4 get on the dance floor" [...] was released as a promotional single on World Music Day. On 27 June 2013, the video promo of the song [...] "Titli" [...] was released, and on 11 July 2013, the promo video of [...] "Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari" [...] was released.

500|$|Ron Guidry {{was named}} the Yankees' {{starting}} pitcher for the October 2 playoff game at Fenway Park. Guidry was able to pitch [...] "because of Lemon's good planning." [...] The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the tie-breaker game, punctuated both by a dramatic three-run home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning, and an eighth-inning homer by Reggie Jackson that proved the game's winning run. Lemon became the third manager in MLB history to replace another mid-season and win the pennant. Lemon's Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title. With the Series win, Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager {{to take over a}} team mid-season and win a World Series. Before the World Series, one columnist wrote, [...] "...many observers feel that Lemon's low-keyed approach with the Yankees' temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness of Martin served to mold a spirit of <b>togetherness</b> among the Yankees that did not even exist last year when they won it all." [...] Lemon and his handling of the season was described in The New York Times as [...] "an island of calm in a stormy summer." [...] Changes Lemon made during the season included returning Thurman Munson to the team's every day catcher (he had been playing in the outfield), putting Jackson in the clean-up spot in the batting order and becoming the regular right fielder, and pitching Ed Figueroa every fourth day (instead of fifth). In October, Lemon {{was named the}} Associated Press' AL Manager of the Year, the second time he received such an award.|$|E
500|$|Back in England {{in early}} June, the {{decision}} taken {{had to be}} kept secret until the promotional tour for the British release of The Book of Talyesin was completed. Meanwhile, {{the search for a}} new singer to replace Evans began and Blackmore asked for help in this task from his old acquaintance Mick Underwood, at the time drummer of the British rock band Episode Six. Underwood recommended Episode Six singer Ian Gillan, whom Blackmore and Lord contacted at a London gig. Gillan, who did not see a future in his then current band, was enthusiastic about joining Deep Purple [...] and involved bassist Roger Glover, with whom he formed a songwriting duo. According to Simper, his replacement with Glover was initially not planned and was due to the creative <b>togetherness</b> of the two Episode Six members. Gillan convinced the reluctant Glover to audition for Deep Purple and the two soon found themselves torn between the new band, which gladly welcomed both of them, and obligations with Episode Six for the completion of a UK tour. Evans, Simper and Episode Six's management were kept unaware of these events and {{of the fact that the}} new line-up was already active in writing and rehearsing new songs. In between gigs all over the country, Deep Purple had rehearsed the song [...] "Hallelujah" [...] with Evans and Simper to be released as a new single, but it was recorded in secret on 7 June by the fresh Mark II line-up at De Lane Studios instead, with Glover still acting as a session musician. The final show of the Mark I line-up was in Cardiff on 4 July 1969, and the Mark II debuted live at The Speakeasy Club in London on 10 July. The final show played by Gillan and Glover with Episode Six was in Little Bardfield on 26 July 1969.
