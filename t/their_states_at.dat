The first one optimizes stack variables, while the second one optimizes heap data structures. • To benchmark our system, we compare the overheads introduced by our semi-automatic approach with the overhead of handwritten application-level checkpoint-ing in an n-body code written by Joshua Barnes. Ex-cept for very small problem sizes, these overheads are comparable. • We highlight various algorithmic challenges in the opti-mization of application-level checkpointing that should provide grist for the mills of the PLDI community. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper I argue that the {{formalism}} of Newtonian mechanics stems directly from the general principle {{to be called the}} principle of microlevel reducibility which physical systems obey in the realm of classical physics. This principle assumes, first, that all the properties of physical systems must be determined by <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>at</b> the current moment of time, in a slogan form it is "only the present matters to physics. " Second, it postulates that any physical system is nothing but an ensemble of structureless particles arranged in some whose interaction obeys the superposition principle. I substantiate this statement and demonstrate directly how the formalism of differential equations, the notion of forces in Newtonian mechanics, the concept of phase space and initial conditions, the principle of least actions, etc. result from the principle of microlevel reducibility. The philosophical concept of thick presentism and the introduction of two dimensional time [...] -physical time and meta-time that are mutually independent on infinitesimal scales [...] -are the the pivot points in these constructions...|$|E

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of using FMO {{is the ability}} to contain the spatial propagation of error within the slice boundary. Since each slice is designed to be decodable independently of other slices, using FMO allows the encoder and decoder to resynchronize <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>at</b> the slice boundary in the event that there is an error in the bit stream. Using FMO also provides a way to spread the erroneous MBs within the frame and take {{advantage of}} the spatial locations of the successfully decoded MBs for better error concealment. However, using FMO for added error resiliency has some trade-offs in coding efficiency. Coding efficiency is reduced because of the restriction of intra prediction across slice boundaries. The motion vector prediction is affected because of having constrained or dispersed search space. The context adaptive variable length coding/context adaptive arithmetic coding entropy coding is also reset {{at the beginning of each}} slice. Using FMO also adds overhead bits because of slice headers and PPS bits. If the MB-to-slice group map, also referred to as an MB address map or an MBA map, is changed in every frame, then a PPS header has to be constructed and inserted in the bit stream.|$|E
30|$|The {{impulsive}} {{differential equations}} {{have been used}} to describe processes that have sudden changes in <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>at</b> certain moments. Many mathematical models in physical phenomena that have short-term perturbations at fixed impulse points t_k, k= 1, 2, 3,...[*], caused by external interventions during their evolution appeared in population dynamics, biotechnology processes, chemistry, physics, engineering, and medicine; see [20 – 22]. In [23, 24], the authors introduced a new class of noninstantaneous impulsive differential equations with initial conditions to describe some certain dynamic changes of evolution processes in the pharmacotherapy. This kind of impulsive differential equations can be distinguished from the usual one as the changing processes containing no ordinary or fractional derivatives of their states work over intervals (t_k,s_k], whereas the usual does at points t_k, k= 1, 2, 3,...[*]. There are some papers on existence and stability theory of this kind of impulsive ordinary or fractional differential equations [25 – 36]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature on noninstantaneous impulsive inequalities. The main goal of the paper is to establish some new noninstantaneous impulsive inequalities using the conformable fractional calculus. The main results are presented in Sect.  2. In Sect.  3, the maximum principle and boundedness of solutions for noninstantaneous impulse problems are illustrated.|$|E

This double pressure either makes or break a state, and it is this tension that is the focus of the special issue. This concluding article offers a bird’s-eye view of the nuances of the differences of the global south and the problems associated with it. I argue that while the differences may indeed be unique, not seeing beyond those is problematic. In line with this, I first acknowledge the differences the global south represents. I look at how the International Relations concepts of state, rational choice, and the international system are seen as inapplicable to the workings of the global south, and how this “misfit” is detected not only in the dynamics of Philippine foreign policy, but also in its relationships with various regional powers like the United States and China. I then turn to the problems associated with seeing only the differences of the global south. I highlight the concepts of mimicry and hybridity before examining the cases of the Philippines’ labor conditions, human security for migrant workers, and disability-related issues. In all these, caution, mindfulness, and the need for dialogue are therefore called for.|$|E

40|$|When {{interpersonal}} {{interactions between}} individuals are {{described by the}} (discrete or continuous) dynamical systems, the interactions are usually assumed to be instantaneous: the rates of change of the actual states of the actors at given instant of time are assumed to depend on <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>at</b> the same time. In reality the natural time delay {{should be included in}} the corresponding models. We investigate a general class of linear models of dyadic interactions with a constant discrete time delay. We prove that in such models the changes of stability of the stationary points from instability to stability or vice versa occur for various intervals of the parameters which determine the intensity of interactions. The conditions guaranteeing arbitrary number (zero, one ore more) of switches are formulated and the relevant theorems are proved. A systematic analysis of all generic cases is carried out. It is obvious that the dynamics of interactions depend both on the strength of reactions of partners on their own states as well as on the partner's state. Results presented in this paper suggest that the joint strength of the reactions of partners to the partner's state, reflected by the product of the strength of reactions of both partners, has greater impact on the dynamics of relationships than the joint strength of reactions to their own states. The dynamics is typically much simpler when the joint strength of reactions to the partner's state is stronger than for their own states. Moreover, we have found that multiple stability switches are possible only in the case of such relationships in which one of the partners reacts with delay on their own state. Some generalizations to triadic interactions are also presented...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{members of}} Congress have {{inserted}} thousands of pork-barrel spending projects into bills to reward interests {{in their home}} states. But such parochial pork {{is only a small}} part of a broader problem of rising federal spending on traditionally state and local activities. Federal spending on aid to the states increased from $ 286 billion in fiscal 2000 to an estimated $ 449 billion in fiscal 2007 and is the third-largest item in the federal budget after Social Security and national defense. The number of different aid programs for the states soared from 463 in 1990, to 653 in 2000, to 814 by 2006. The theory behind aid to the states is that federal policymakers can design and operate programs in the national interest to efficiently solve local problems. In practice, most federal politicians are not inclined to pursue broad, national goals; they are consumed by the competitive scramble to secure subsidies for <b>their</b> <b>states.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, federal aid stimulates overspending by the states, requires large bureaucracies to administer, and comes with a web of complex regulations that limit state flexibility. At all levels of the aid system, the focus is on spending and regulations, not on delivering quality services. And by involving all levels of government in just about every policy area, the aid system creates a lack of accountability. When every government is responsible for an activity, no government is responsible, as was evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The failings of federal aid have long been recognized, but reforms and cuts have not been pursued for years. Aid has spawned a web of interlocking interests that block reform, including elected officials at three levels of government, armies of government employees, and thousands of trade associations representing the recipients of aid. Yet the system desperately needs to be scaled back, not least because the rising costs of federal programs for the elderly are putting a squeeze on the federal budget. To help spur reform, this study examines the historical growth of the aid system and describes its failings. Congress should reconsider the need for aid and begin terminating activities that could be better performed by state and local governments and the private sector...|$|E
40|$|In 1985, Clarke and Cornish {{proposed}} the rational choice framework to study criminal decision making. According to their approach, decisions {{of a criminal}} nature are not {{different than any other}} type of decision, and are thus orientated toward the satisfaction of commonplace needs. We adopted this approach and looked at a sample of 898 male sexual offenders as decision makers, framing their sexually coercive decisions as means to obtain desired outcomes. Clarke and Cornish specifically proposed four models to understand criminal decision making (initial involvement, crime events, persistence, and desistance); aspects of these models were used in three distinct studies. Study 1 explored what Clarke and Cornish called “background factors” of decision making and it examined three particular types of factors: traits, states, and knowledge. Results indicated that offenders’ personality traits, their specialized knowledge about sexual coercion, and <b>their</b> <b>states</b> <b>at</b> the onset of their offenses all impacted decision making during sexual crimes and over their sexual criminal careers in identifiable patterns, suggesting a more direct influence of background factors than initially hypothesized by Clarke and Cornish. Study 2 investigated how the various sexually coercive decisions made in the course of sexual crime incidents were linked to the resulting outcomes experienced by offenders. Results indicated that specific offending decisions about the selection of a victim, the location and time of the offense, and the method of assault were all found to contribute to the production and avoidance of, respectively, specific immediate positive and negative outcomes for offenders, validating Clarke and Cornish’s concept of bounded rationality. Finally, Study 3 investigated the aftermath of experiences of outcomes in offenders and looked specifically at evidence indicating possible reinforcing and/or deterrent effects of outcomes experienced in prior sex crimes on offenders’ decisions to persist in sexual offending after release. Analyses indicated that the experience of previous positive outcomes in sexual crime is a significant explanatory factor of offenders’ decisions to persist in or desist from sexual crime upon release, indicating that Clarke and Cornish’s rational choice approach is a valid framework for examining decisions made about the direction of a criminal career...|$|E
