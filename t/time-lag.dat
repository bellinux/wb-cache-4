We here present the results from a systematic analysis of <b>time-lags</b> between variations in two energy bands (5 - 7 vs 2 - 4 keV) for seven X-ray bright and variable AGN. Aims: We estimate <b>time-lags</b> as accurately as possible and fit them with theoretical models {{in the context of the}} lamp-post geometry. We also constrain the geometry of the X-ray emitting region in AGN. Methods: We used all available archival XMM-Newton data for the sources in our sample and extracted light curves in the 5 - 7 and 2 - 4 keV energy bands. We used these light curves and applied a thoroughly tested (through extensive numerical simulations) recipe to estimate <b>time-lags</b> that have minimal bias, approximately follow a Gaussian distribution, and have known errors.

The latter were computed assuming a point-like primary X-ray source above a black hole surrounded by a neutral and prograde accretion disc with solar iron abundance.

Knowledge of these distances may therefore be crucial {{in determining the}} appropriate spatial scales for research and management. However, dispersal distances are difficult to measure, especially for vagile organisms like songbirds. For these species, the use of traditional markrecapture and radio-telemetry methods is problematic. We used positive one-year <b>time-lagged</b> correlations in abundance to estimate natal dispersal distances. Using the North American Breeding Bird Survey database, we examined one-year <b>time-lagged</b> correlations between pairs of North American songbird samples separated by 10100 km.
