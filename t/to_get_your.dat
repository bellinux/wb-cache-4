25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E

500|$|From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland {{with the}} Anew McMaster {{repertory}} company, playing {{over a dozen}} roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, {{he worked for the}} Donald Wolfit Company, at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. [...] To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, [...] "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." [...] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: [...] "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. [...] They're something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into." [...] During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.|$|E
500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I forgive you because you do it <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out.

500|$|Mackinac Island {{has been}} a tourist {{destination}} since the late 19th century. The island was the country's second national park, after Yellowstone, until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park. M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as the Chicago Tribune, The Kansas City Star, The Saturday Evening Post, and the Toronto Star. and [...] In 2003, it was named the [...] "best scenic drive" [...] in the state by The Detroit News.

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{compared}} the black-and-white {{look of the}} video with Madonna's [...] "Vogue", 1920s German Expressionist cinema and Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. He further noted influences from Liza Minnelli, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' [...] "Don't Come Around Here No More", and Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. A writer of The Independent wrote, [...] "Showing Gaga {{in a number of}} guises (as a Beatnik performance artist, her face smeared with clown make-up, sporting David Bowie-esque androgyny while wearing a bra made of black, leather gloves and as various winged creatures), the high energy accompaniment to her new track is a hotch-potch of imagery that seems to highlight the pop princess' ever changing appearance." [...] Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair described the video as a moving photo shoot for Interview magazine [...] "except with more sanity". Rovzar concluded that it also featured [...] "the standard Gaga nonsense" [...] and praised Gaga's smile during several scenes of the video as a highlight. James Montgomery of MTV News saw the video as Gaga [...] "pulling the curtain back on her creative process, showing the viewer how she's willing to do anything to please the public." [...] Melinda Newman of Hitfix felt Gaga [...] "continues her one-woman performance art with the very theatrical video" [...] and interpreted it as showing that [...] "there is nothing Lady Gaga won’t do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> attention".|$|E

500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, but you may want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|Amos Barshad from New York {{declared}} that the song reminded him of being drunk and dancing in a remote discothèque in Berlin.

Pointing the same thing, Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote that the song played to Gaga's established musical sensibilities. He added that although [...] "Judas" [...] certainly had its own charms and [...] "at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on Gaga's signature moves." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice summarized the song as a twin of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing its [...] "instantly memorable wordless vocalizing, a pummeling beat, lyrics about a romance that is, well, bad." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey gave the song five out of five stars, commending the [...] "blasphemously camp" [...] chorus and comparing it to be worthy of Eurovision – [...] "a Scooch-meets-Lordi affair that, unsurprisingly, takes a few listens <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> head around." [...] Mark Lepage from The Gazette praised the song and understood that as Gaga's music has progressed, so has her themes and inspirations, indicated by the conflicted relationship she has with the character Judas in the song. Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, compared it to [...] "'Like a Prayer' on steroids" [...] and gave it three out of five points. NME called the song [...] "Gaga's worst single so far".|$|E
500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> strength from God; you don’t get it on your own. If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E
