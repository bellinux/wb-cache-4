5|$|After {{a disappointing}} 2012–13 season which saw the Colorado Avalanche finish 15th in the Western Conference and 29th {{overall in the}} League, it was {{announced}} on April 28, 2013, that Head Coach Joe Sacco had been relieved of his duties. On May 10, {{it was announced that}} former long-time Avalanche captain and Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic is set to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> expanded role in Avalanche management, being named executive vice president of hockey operations, overseeing all matters involving hockey personnel. It was also announced that Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan Kroenke, is now president of the Avalanche, succeeding Pierre Lacroix. On May 23, Patrick Roy returned to the Avalanche as head coach and vice president of hockey operations. Although Sherman retained his role as general manager, he was largely reduced to an advisory role. Roy and Sakic now share most of the duties held by a general manager on most other NHL teams, though Sakic has the final say on hockey matters.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> even more complex helicopter type.|$|E

It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E

5|$|The main {{contemporary}} accounts {{relating to}} Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin {{and tend to}} emphasize Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs {{to pay tribute to}} the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E

25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a butt joint without reinforcement. The dowels offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, dowels may shrink and become loose. They <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose dowels allow the joint to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in creaking chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, dowel joints are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|E
