Even {{at the level of}} single electrons, the spin–orbit interaction has proven promising for coherent spin rotations 2. Here we implement a spin–orbit quantum bit (qubit) in an indium arsenide nanowire, where the spin–orbit interaction is so strong that spin and motion can no longer be separated 3, 4. In this regime, we realize fast qubit rotations and universal single-qubit control using only electric fields; the qubits are hosted in single-electron quantum dots that are individually addressable. We enhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubits from the environment. Nanowires offer various advantages for quantum computing: they can serve as one-dimensional templates for scalable qubit registers, and it is possible to vary the material even during wire growth 5. Such flexibility can be used to design wires with suppressed decoherence and to push semiconductor qubit fidelities towards error correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated with optical dots in p–n junction nanowires 6.

To date, experimental work has relied upon the optical scattering force to create conditions necessary for observation of dynamical back action effects. However, alongside the scattering force there are also dipole optical forces that can furnish optomechanical coupling. These forces, also referred to as dispersive or gradient forces, have been used to control coupling of a waveguide to a resonator [9] and to couple pairs of waveguides [10, 11]. In the present work, a stacked, double-disk whispering gallery system is demonstrated as a new means to cavity optomechanical phenomena. Dipole-force coupling between the disks creates optomechnical coupling, causing displacement of the disks and tuning of the underlying whispering gallery resonances. In comparison to scattering-force-based systems, this double-disk configuration has the significant advantage of providing a larger optomechanical coupling constant, independent of the cavity round trip length...|$|R

Inverter-resident islanding detection methods (IDMs) employ locally measured parameters to detect islanding. Passive type IDMs only monitor local {{variables such as}} voltage and frequency while active IDMs inject disturbances into the supply system and detect islanding based on system responses. Although very effective in systems with a single inverter, {{it is believed that}} active frequency drifting IDMs might have their effectiveness reduced in multi-inverter systems. This thesis investigates the islanding detection capabilities of multi-inverter systems. Three possible scenarios with passive-active, different and same type of active IDMs were discussed.

The solution, however of the Young Laplace equation becomes tricky when a droplet {{is sitting on}} a geometrically patterned surface and multiple, and unknown a priori, three phase contact lines have not been accounted for, since air pockets are trapped beneath the liquid droplet. In this work, we propose an augmented Young-Laplace equation, in which a unified formulation for the liquid/vapor and liquid/solid interfaces is adopted, incorporating microscale <b>interactions.</b> <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> we bypass the implementation of the Young's contact angle boundary condition at each three phase contact line.

The application of well-established parameter continuation techniques enables the tracing of stable and unstable equilibrium solutions if necessary for the determination of energy barriers separating co-existing stable wettign states. Since energy barriers determine whether a surface facilitates or inhibits certain wetting transitions, their computation is important for many technical applications.

Classic approaches {{have tried to}} understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the <b>interaction</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator–prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator–prey relationships {{in terms of an}} evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator–prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator–prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits—through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses—and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator–prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator–prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts...|$|R
