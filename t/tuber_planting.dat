40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>tuber</b> <b>planting</b> date on yield of potato cultivars was {{examined}} during three seasons. Planting date {{had a significant}} effect on yield, although cultivars showed significant variation in yield potential at the different dates. Varietal yield was significantly correlated with planting date and thus was probably a response to changing temperatures during the growing season. The yield increase in some cultivars was attributable to greater tuber number; in others it was because of greater tuber weight. Cultivars Vivaldi, Carlita, Bydand, Donald and Sterling were identified as having the potential for general cultivation in the arid climate of the Arabian Gulf. The results are discussed in terms of a national strategy for potato production, possibly involving a delay in planting date from mid November to mid December, allowing greater land use efficiency during the short cropping season...|$|E

Field studies revealed no significant treatment effects on total yield, number of <b>tubers</b> per <b>plant,</b> weight per <b>tuber</b> or numbers of eyes per tuber. In greenhouse studies, the presence of stolons on transplants significantly increased total tuber yield, number of <b>tubers</b> per <b>plant,</b> weight per <b>tuber,</b> and eyes per tuber compared with plantlets with stolons absent at transplanting. Early stolon formation decreased transplant height but, as potato plants matured, treatment effects on vine length became negligible.
