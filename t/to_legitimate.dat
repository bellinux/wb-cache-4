25|$|Compared <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> institutions, diploma mills {{tend to have}} {{drastically}} lowered academic requirements, if any at all.

25|$|Representations {{will not}} lead <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> {{expectations}} when delegation of such {{power to the}} individual making the representation is forbidden by statute, or where the individual making the representation lacks actual or apparent authority. In the latter case, the applicant's expectation will lack legitimacy and thus would prima facie not be binding on the public authority.|$|E

25|$|Carlos I was a {{constitutional}} monarch. He did not claim autocratic power, but instead ruled {{according to the}} Constitutional Charter of 1826 which stated that the succession to the throne passed only <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> descendants. The Constitution, including all matters of succession, could only be amended by the Cortes. Even if Carlos had signed a document granting succession rights to Maria Pia, {{it would have had}} no legal value at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{personal}} possessions of Haarmann's victims would typically be retained for the personal use of Haarmann or his lover, Hans Grans, or be {{sold on the}} black market through criminal contacts both men had established at Hanover Central Station, although the {{personal possessions}} of some victims were sold <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> retailers. In several instances, both Haarmann and Grans are known to have given possessions belonging to various victims to acquaintances as gifts.|$|E
25|$|After {{the final}} defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Alexander {{became known as}} the 'savior of Europe.' He presided over the {{redrawing}} of the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which made him the king of Congress Poland. He formed the Holy Alliance with Austria and Prussia, to suppress revolutionary movements in Europe that he saw as immoral threats <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> Christian monarchs. He helped Austria's Klemens von Metternich in suppressing all national and liberal movements.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} speculated that {{the choice of the}} college as a {{beneficiary}} by the two later Henrys was a political one, with Henry VII in particular concerned <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> a new, post-civil war Tudor regime by demonstrating patronage of what was by definition the King's College. Later building work on the chapel is marked by an uninhibited branding with the Tudor rose and other symbols of the new establishment, quite against the precise instructions of the Founder's Will.|$|E
25|$|The federal payment was {{controversial}} {{for both}} supporters {{and opponents of}} Miller's administration. Liberal MP Tony Ianno defended it as providing fair compensation <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> claimants, and saying that it invalidated Miller's pledge to cancel the bridge without incurring further expense. Miller's allies, including NDP leader Jack Layton, argued that the payout was overly generous, and did not reflect the true costs of cancellation. Shortly after the settlement, Miller {{announced that he would}} seek the repayment of $27 million in back taxes from the Port Authority to the city.|$|E
25|$|A SYN flood {{occurs when}} a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets are handled like a {{connection}} request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection, by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because the sender address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> requests until after the attack ends.|$|E

25|$|These {{collections}} of systems compromisers {{are known as}} botnets / rootservers. DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like smurf attacks and fraggle attacks (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). SYN floods (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> users. More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools {{for the purposes of}} extortioneven against their business rivals.|$|E
25|$|The Bronze Horseman of {{the title}} was sculpted by Étienne Maurice Falconet and {{completed}} in 1782. Catherine the Great, a German princess that married into the Romanov family, commissioned {{the construction of the}} statue <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> her rule and claim to the throne to the Russian people. Catherine came to power through an illegal palace coup after the death of her husband. She had the statue inscribed with the phrase, Петру перьвому Екатерина вторая, лѣта 1782, in both Latin and Russian, meaning Peter the first Catherine the second, both to show reverence to the ruler and indicate where she saw her place among Russia’s rulers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lower}} Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the Gouwu in {{southern}} Jiangsu and the Yuyue in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence from the 9th centuryBC. Traditional accounts credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed {{power over the}} local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, {{they were among the}} most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.|$|E

25|$|In April 2012 {{an amnesty}} law was passed, but it {{prevents}} {{the return of}} former president Marc Ravalomanana despite the South African Development Community's attempts at brokering a reconciliation agreement signed by all parties {{that would allow him}} to return. In December 2012, Ravalomanana agreed to withdraw his candidacy in compliance with the international community's roadmap <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> elections in Madagascar; Rajoelina followed suit two months later. However, when Ravalomanana's wife Lalao submitted her candidacy despite not having met the six-month residency requirement prior to doing so, Rajoelina likewise submitted his candidature after the deadline had officially closed. Former president Didier Ratsiraka also submitted his candidacy, despite also failing to meet the six-month residency requirement. Donors consequently pulled funding for the election, leading it to be postponed twice in 2013. In May 2013, {{the first round of the}} presidential elections was scheduled for 23 August 2013 alongside Parliamentary elections, with a second round of presidential elections in October if a runoff were needed. In September 2013, the first round of presidential elections was scheduled for 25 October, with a presidential run-off, if necessary, and parliamentary elections to be held on 20 December 2013.|$|E
25|$|The DMCA has {{affected}} the worldwide cryptography research community, since an argument {{can be made that}} any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. While working for ElcomSoft in Russia, he developed The Advanced eBook Processor, a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted e-books, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States. Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after presenting a speech at DEF CON and subsequently spent nearly a month in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling <b>to</b> <b>legitimate</b> users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Edward Felten and students at Princeton), and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the U.S.|$|E
