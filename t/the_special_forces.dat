5|$|It still {{came as a}} {{shock to}} <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks {{attacked}} their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious tanks of the 203rd NVA Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of June 9, 1965, the Viet Cong made final {{preparations}} for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While the Viet Cong assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Camp were suddenly placed on alert, forcing the Viet Cong to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 11:30pm Viet Cong heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, the Viet Cong sustained heavy casualties {{as they tried to}} navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 1:30am, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Camp, they fired on the Viet Cong around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30am, the Americans {{and a few of the}} Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, the Viet Cong had captured <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a model for the assessment and selection personnel for <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Command based on procedures applied by the United States Army <b>Special</b> <b>Forces.</b> <b>The</b> study assumes a high degree of similarity between the United States and <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> in terms of organizational structure and mission statement. A survey was conducted of members of <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> to obtain <b>the</b> views regarding the most critical personal attributes in <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces.</b> Common Assessments of these attributes were then compared with those specified for personnel in <b>the</b> United States <b>Special</b> <b>Forces.</b> <b>The</b> results of the survey indicate that the most critical person attributes of the United States and <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> are generally similar with sort slight differences. The study concludes that a standardized personal selection program such as <b>the</b> United States <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Assessment and Selection process can be used in <b>the</b> Turkish <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> with some modifications that account for differences in culture and organization missions.

5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity {{that he had just}} reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Tung was a {{high-ranking}} official in Nhu's Cần Lao, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen.

5|$|Tung {{was born}} in 1923 in central Vietnam, which was then the {{protectorate}} of Annam in French Indochina. The former servant of the Ngô family was devoutly Roman Catholic, short and bespectacled. Tung had a military background almost entirely in security and counterespionage, which was an unusual basis for leading <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>forces.</b> Tung had first served the French as a security officer in Central Vietnam. He then worked for Diệm as a lieutenant in the military security service in Central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's Cần Lao, the secret Catholic political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen. Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unwavering loyalty to Diệm. In 1960, he was promoted straight {{to the rank of}} colonel and placed in charge of <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>forces.</b> The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Diệm and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>forces</b> commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E

5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>forces.</b> This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer in 1999 and underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During the process, she did not miss {{a day on the}} bench.

Since 1999, Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces,</b> has trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court. In spite of her small stature, Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve since her first bout with cancer, being able to complete twenty full push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, <b>the</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Forces</b> were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
