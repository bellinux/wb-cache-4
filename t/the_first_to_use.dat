5|$|Although {{the use of}} the {{graduated}} scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu (224–271 AD), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century AD, cartographer Zhang Heng was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> scales and grids for maps.|$|E
5|$|Colt's {{manufacturing}} methods {{were at the}} forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the assembly line efficiently. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.|$|E
5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the term in a publication.|$|E

5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata Kōrin. He was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> mother of pearl and pewter in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's {{first two}} periods {{were based on}} those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy {{was no longer in}} a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E

5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of {{the brigade}} were also some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the MRAP, or Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle. The {{soldiers}} used the vehicles to train other soldiers {{on use of}} the vehicle, particularly leaders of the 10th Sustainment Brigade, which replaced the 1st Sustainment Brigade in late 2008.|$|E

5|$|The launch was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last {{to use the}} original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These {{had been replaced by}} a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent {{of civilian control}} of nuclear power and the abandonment of nuclear testing. In 1950 {{he was one of}} twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the hydrogen bomb. Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a storage medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC had been <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived {{towards the end of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{the student}} {{population}} was over 10,000, placing it as the fourth largest California state institution and larger than 96% of the U.S.’s colleges and universities at the time. In 1957, entering freshmen scores on examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college’s scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and other tasks of the large number of students. To keep up with student expansion, the square footage of the buildings and classrooms was increased from 255,434 to 1,243,737.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> handcarts, {{they were the only}} group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Liverpool Street {{became the}} new {{terminus}} of the Central London Railway {{after the completion}} of an extension project from Bank. The deep-level Central line platforms 4 and 5 opened on 28 July 1912 as the eastern terminus of the Central London Railway. The tube station was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Moore Vacuum Tube, a new system of lighting that produced three times as much as a normal bulb.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, French scholar George Wellers {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> German data on deportations to {{estimate}} the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at a figure of 1,471,595 deaths, including 1.35million Jews and 86,675 Poles. A larger study started by Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in the 1990s. Piper stated that a figure {{of as many as}} 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E
