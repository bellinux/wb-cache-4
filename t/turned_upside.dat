5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E

5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, Hendrix played {{right-handed}} guitars {{that were}} <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down and restrung for left-hand playing. This {{had an important}} effect on {{the sound of his}} guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was the opposite of the Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down.|$|E

5|$|Public {{houses on}} Old Kent Road have been closing since the 1980s. At one point, there were 39 pubs. The Dun Cow at No.279 opened in 1856 and {{was well known}} as a gin palace, and later became a {{champagne}} bar and featured DJs such as Steve Walsh and Robbie Vincent. The premises closed in 2004 to become a surgery. The World <b>Turned</b> <b>Upside</b> Down {{had been on the}} Old Kent Road since the 17th century, and may have been named after the discovery of Australia, Van Diemen's Land, or Tierra del Fuego in South America. The pub became a music venue in the 20th century and is where Long John Baldrey gave his first live performance in 1958. It closed in 2009 and is now a branch of Domino's Pizza. The Duke of Kent was converted into a mosque in 1999; in 2011 the mosque was planned to move to the former site of the Old Kent Road swimming baths. The Livesey Museum for Children closed in 2008 owing to council budget cuts and is now used for short term accommodation.|$|E
5|$|The early Germanic Jastorf {{cultural}} sphere was in {{the beginning}} an impoverished continuation of the North German Urnfield culture and the Nordic circle cultures. It formed around 700–550 BC in northern Germany and Jutland under the Hallstatt influence and in Jastorf's early stages its funeral customs resembled a lot those of the contemporary Pomeranian culture. From the Jastorf culture, which rapidly expanded from around 500 BC on, two groups sprang and settled the western borderlands of Poland during the 300–100 BC period: The Oder group in western Pomerania and the Gubin group further south. These peripheral for the Jastorf culture groups very likely originated as Pomeranian culture populations influenced by the Jastorf cultural model. Jastorf communities established large burial grounds, separate for men and women. The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns, which were covered by bowls <b>turned</b> <b>upside</b> down. Funeral gifts were modest and rather uniform, indicating a society that was neither affluent nor socially diversified.|$|E
