5|$|A ring could {{possibly}} exist in Himalia's orbit. One {{possible explanation is}} that a small moon had crashed into Himalia and the force of the impact caused material <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> off Himalia.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{with a very}} powerful serve and deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes his opponents deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> past them with a winner. His forehand {{is one of his}} main strengths and possibly the most powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds of 160km/h.|$|E
5|$|Kutuzov ordered Yermolov to take action; {{the general}} brought forward three horse {{artillery}} batteries that began <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> the open-ended redoubt, while the 3rd Battalion of the Ufa Regiment and two Jäger regiments {{brought up by}} Barclay rushed in with the bayonet to eliminate Bonami's Brigade. The Russian reinforcements' assault returned the redoubt to Russian control.|$|E

Taking a {{structure}} of single-degree freedom as analyzed object, the problem of structural dynamic response <b>to</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration loads was transformed into the problem of that {{to a series of}} simple harmonic loads with wavelet packet method. A safety criterion of structural response <b>to</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration has been put forward, which is more detailed, reasonable and scientific than others in use with involving parameters related <b>to</b> structural characteristics, <b>blasting</b> energy, blasting amplitude, blasting frequency and blasting duration...|$|R
5|$|As {{the ship}} reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears {{that the crew}} are pirates, and mutiny erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia, and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has left the map behind. Thinking that Jim has the map, Silver has a chance <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> Jim, but hesitates because of his {{attachment}} to the boy. The fugitives are shot down by a mutineer during their escape, injuring Amelia.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, {{is able to}} choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.|$|E

5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult <b>to</b> <b>blast,</b> and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> {{the shark}} with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
40|$|The Application of Size Distribution Equations to Rock Breakage by Explosives: Size {{distribution}} equations {{can be used}} {{to describe}} the degree of fragmentation produced by explosive rock breakage.

5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, Von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
50|$|The MUTCD's W22 {{series of}} signs is for warning signs {{relating}} <b>to</b> <b>blasting</b> zones. These signs are typically orange background ones used for temporary situations.

40|$|Isolated blast {{injuries}} of {{the face}} are rare and injuries due <b>to</b> <b>blasting</b> of low voltage batteries {{in or near the}} mouth are even rarer. We present here a case of an 18 year old boy who suffered from extensive injury and tissue loss involving the lower half {{of the face}} due <b>to</b> <b>blasting</b> of a low voltage battery used in a flash light due to apparent shortcircuiting when the boy put the two short wires connected to a low voltage battery in his mouth in order to deinsulate them. This resulted in a <b>blast</b> leading <b>to</b> severe injuries and tissue loss which included the lower nose, upper lip, all teeth, both cheeks, floor of mouth tongue, chin, the maxilla and mandible...|$|R
50|$|Most of the ship's {{machinery}} {{was sold}} in 1874 and 1875, and the ship was sold for scrap at public auction in 1881. The scrappers had <b>to</b> use <b>blasting</b> <b>to</b> dismantle her hull.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Nürnberg was among the ships interned. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. British sailors used explosive charges <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> away Nürnbergs anchor chains so she could be dragged aground before she sank. The ship was refloated in July and eventually expended as a target ship on 7 July 1922 off the Isle of Wight.|$|E
5|$|Jackie Chan was the stunt {{director}} of Rob-B-Hood, having choreographed all the stunts with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in the film, for example, jumping between several air-conditioners {{on the outer}} wall of a tall building to reach the ground. Several scenes required Chan to co-ordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which he climbed {{on the underside of}} a roller coaster with the baby in hand. Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots and fallen off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie. Chan's combat choreography included the use of improvised weapons in combat; when he fought a pair of skilled henchmen in a deep freeze room, he defeated them by spraying them with milk and then using a large fan <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> them with cold air.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the furnace. With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E
50|$|Accident {{data from}} the Mine Safety and Health Administration {{indicate}} that flyrock and lack of blast area security were the main causes of blasting-related injuries in surface mining. Fatal injuries due <b>to</b> lack of <b>blast</b> area security were caused mainly by failure <b>to</b> clear the <b>blast</b> area or inadequate access control <b>to</b> the <b>blast</b> area. Proper planning can {{reduce the incidence of}} flyrock.|$|R

5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Gould into the Pillar, electrocuting him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive {{and destroy the}} Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron {{that he will be}} replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm, and is about to execute him when Megatron intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1944, around 0830, 3rd Battalion hit the Asan beaches on Guam. Landing on {{the extreme}} left of the entire 3rd Marine Division, their mission was to take Chonito Cliff and Adelup Point, which marked the left flank of the division. Within minutes the Japanese {{defenders}} opened up with mortars and machine guns, hitting many 3rd Battalion Marines coming ashore. By 0912 battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Houser reported many casualties caused by both mortars and sniper fire. Both Kilo and India Companies rushed the Chonito Cliffs but the Japanese defenders (Elements of the 2d Battalion, 18th Regiment and 320th Independent Infantry Battalion) resisted strongly, in some cases rolling grenades down the hillside. Supported by flamethrowers, half-tracks, and armor from the 3rd Tank Battalion, 3rd Battalion fought a bloody, three-hour battle {{up the side of}} Chonito Cliff. Houser then ordered Lima Company to flank the cliffs to the north by dashing down an exposed beach road. Having secured Chonito Cliff, the battalion then moved on to Adelup Point. The US Navy sent a destroyer <b>to</b> <b>blast</b> the Japanese caves at point-blank range and 3rd Battalion flamethrowers burned out Japanese soldiers who still remained. After securing Adelup Point, 3rd Battalion finished the day providing flank security {{for the rest of the}} 3rd Marines during the Battle for Bundschu Ridge and became the only unit in the regiment to accomplish its objectives by the end of W-Day.|$|E
