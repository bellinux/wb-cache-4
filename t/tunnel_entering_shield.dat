Upon <b>entering</b> <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.'s</b> Helicarrier, Tony Stark catches an agent playing Galaga and remarks, [...] "That man is playing Galaga. Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did." [...] After the Avengers' team meeting, the agent {{returns to his}} game.|$|R
50|$|Conceived and {{constructed}} {{as a means}} to improve traffic circulation, the tunnel opened in September 1953 as a replacement facility for the now-defunct Morgans Point Ferry at a final cost of $10 million. The land where the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entered</b> and exited was leased from Exxon by the state for an annual fee of $1.|$|R
50|$|HOV lanes {{are also}} an {{effective}} way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with less than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and <b>tunnels</b> <b>entering</b> the city except the George Washington Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The bunker {{is built}} 125 ft {{underground}} and the entrance is through an ordinary looking bungalow (a standard ROTOR 'Guard House') set amongst trees. The {{inside of the}} bungalow leads to a 100 yd <b>tunnel</b> <b>entering</b> the R4 at its lowest floor (of three). Above are two more floors, the 'hill' which covers it, and a radio mast.|$|R
50|$|The Mersey Railway <b>tunnel</b> <b>entering</b> Central Low Level {{from the}} north of the station was aligned with the high level station's {{approach}} tunnel from the south. This was to ensure minimum engineering work if ever there was to be a link up of the two tunnels - as did occur when the two tunnels were linked in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|After Breezewood, I-76 {{continues}} {{along the}} turnpike, heading northeast across Rays Hill into Fulton County. The turnpike continues east across Sideling Hill, before reaching an interchange with US522 in Fort Littleton. After this interchange the highway parallels US522 before curving east into Huntingdon County. The turnpike goes under Tuscarora Mountain through the Tuscarora Mountain <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>entering</b> Franklin County. It then curves northeast into a valley {{to the exit}} for PA75 in Willow Hill.|$|R
50|$|The power intake {{structure}} will be constructed on right {{bank of the}} river immediately upstream of Dam site and will divert the water into headrace <b>tunnels</b> <b>entering</b> into Cavern Powerhouse. The water will be discharged back to River Jhelum through tail-race channel located at right bank of the River Jhelum immediately downstream of Karot village. The dam will generate mean annual energy 3,436 GWh, and will connect to Pakistan's national electricity grid.|$|R
5000|$|The viaduct {{provides}} a pedestrian-, bicycle-, and bus-free express route for taxicabs and other automobile traffic from 40th Street to 46th Street. From the south, traffic from Park Avenue or the Park Avenue <b>Tunnel</b> <b>enters</b> a ramp which rises to a [...] "T" [...] above 42nd Street, over the street-level entrance to Grand Central Terminal below; Pershing Square, the side ramps of Park Avenue at this point, descend from 40th to end at 42nd Street.|$|R

50|$|The train {{leaves the}} station {{climbing}} the 128 ft lift hill. From there riders plunge 144 ft twisting {{to the right}} passing an on-ride camera and <b>entering</b> an underwater <b>tunnel.</b> The train exits the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entering</b> a 360-degree vertical loop followed by a sidewinder inversion (a half loop that uses a corkscrew at the top to change direction). After riding a small hill, the train enters the first brake run nearly slowing to a complete stop.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{pressure}} fluctuations {{of the surge}} tank in the Zimapan Hydroelectric Project are compared in a hydraulic model. The shaft is located lateral, over the conduction tunnel and in the simple form (permitting the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entering</b> the shaft), with and without orifice plates {{taking into account the}} demand and supply condition of energy with the minimum level of water of the conduction. It was determined the hydraulic efficiency and it was found that it was the best constructive option...|$|R
5|$|The 1992 Civic District Master Plan public {{exhibition}} was held from 22–26 February by the URA. An important revision was the mentioning of the one-way Fort Canning <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>entering</b> the hill at the existing National Library and emerging at Penang Road {{to be built}} by the year 2000. The URA explained that the 380m long tunnel would help smoothen the major traffic intersection in front of Cathay Building and direct heavy traffic away from the Marina to Orchard areas, thus giving the museum precinct a peaceful and quiet ambience.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} phase a radical {{transformation}} occurs in mental imagery. The most noticeable change is that the shaman {{becomes part of the}} experience. Subjects under laboratory conditions have found that they experience sliding down a rotating <b>tunnel,</b> <b>entering</b> caves or holes in the ground. People in {{the third phase}} begin to lose their grip on reality and hallucinate monsters and animals of strong emotional content. In this phase, therianthropes in rock painting can be explained as heightened sensory awareness that gives one the feeling that they have undergone a physical transformation.|$|R
50|$|To the {{south-west}} of Oerlikon station, {{the line}} through the station divides into three lines, with fly-overs and dive-unders providing non-conflicting access routes {{to and from the}} different lines. The three lines all link to Zürich Hauptbahnhof by different tunnels through the intermediate ridge, these being the Wipkingen Tunnel, the Käferberg Tunnel and the Weinberg Tunnel. The first two of these approach the Hauptbahnhof from the west, giving access to both its upper level terminal platforms and its low level through platforms, whilst the Weinberg <b>Tunnel</b> <b>enters</b> the low level through platforms from the east.|$|R

5000|$|With the Schuman-Josaphat <b>tunnel</b> <b>entering</b> {{into service}} on 4 April 2016, a new {{connection}} {{was established to}} connect Brussels Airport directly to the stations of the EU quarter—Brussels-Schuman and Brussels-Luxembourg. [...] This brought the travel time between the Airport and the EU quarter to about 15 minutes. The tunnel was originally scheduled to open on 12 December 2015, but it was delayed due to the Brussels lockdown. When it eventually opened in April 2016, it could not yet be used to its full potential as the airport station remained closed following the Brussels bombings.|$|R

5000|$|Töö Ashuu (Төө-Ашуу, Тёо Ашуу), {{literally}} [...] "camel pass", is {{a mountain}} pass in Kyrgyzstan {{on the highway}} from Bishkek to Osh (European route E010) in Kyrgyzstan approximately 120 km from Bishkek. The pass goes over part of the Kyrgyz Alatau range of the Tien Shan mountains. A 2.7 km road <b>tunnel</b> <b>enters</b> the mountain at 3130 m {{on the north side}} and comes out at 3180 m on the south side. The old pass over the mountain at this point was around 3500 m and thus this road pass is often described as reaching this height.|$|R

40|$|The {{human eye}} {{is able to}} adapt itself {{to a wide range}} of luminances from very bright {{daylight}} to very low night light. The human visual system modifies its sensitiv-ity when an increment or a decrement of illumination occurs. During this transition, known as eye adapta-tion, our system experiments a temporary blindness. Il-lumination changes commonly happen in video games (driven through a <b>tunnel,</b> <b>entering</b> in a dark house or walking in a cave under torchlight) and rendering tech-niques must take into account theses situations. In this paper, we present a system for accelerating interactive rendering, based on using polygonal simplifications in luminance variations on the scene. We discuss the influ-ence of the preadaptation light, the duration of the tran-sition and the responses to different intensities changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to present a system of approximation formulae which allow the calculation of the pressure-time history in various tunnel-chamber arrangements in case of conventional weapon detonation at the tunnel entrance. It is necessary to know how a blast wave propagates through tunnels and rooms inside a structure in order to define the loading on blast closures and ventilation systems of an underground shelter. We have used small-scale model tests which allow {{a great number of}} tests with different configurations. In a distance of 10 to 100 tunnel diameters, the straight <b>tunnel</b> <b>enters</b> an expansion chamber. We have investigated 12 different chamber shapes, namely cubes, long and short cuboids. For a 10 square m tunnel, the chamber volumne can vary from 1000 cubicmetre to 3000 cubicmetre...|$|R
