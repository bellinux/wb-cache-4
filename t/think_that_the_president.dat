50|$|Now I have a {{very sad}} duty, gentlemen, I don't know whether you have heard.

We are going ahead, but we are going ahead in a thoughtful sorrow about what has transpired. I have watched you gentlemen, and I think you are men of sufficient mental integrity not to let this influence you in any way in the decision of this case.
