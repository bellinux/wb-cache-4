5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E

25|$|Prior to a ship's docking to the ISS, {{navigation}} and attitude control (GNC) is {{handed over to}} the ground control of the ships' country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. When a NASA Space Shuttle docked to the station, other ships were grounded, as the Shuttle's reinforced carbon-carbon wing leading edges, cameras, windows, and instruments were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships' movements.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the type of fishing a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties {{can be used in a}} single rod. In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E
25|$|The {{phase diagram}} {{explains}} why liquids {{do not exist}} in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vapourize (sublime) {{as soon as it}} is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock doesn't heat it up <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> <b>At</b> some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapour. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Honda {{returned}} to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with the monocoque-framed, four-stroke NR500. The FIM rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, {{in order to}} provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant two-stroke racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted their first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in , Honda won their first 500cc Grand Prix World Championship with Freddie Spencer. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top level titles with riders such as Mick Doohan and Valentino Rossi. Honda also head the number of wins at the Isle of Man TT having notched up 227 victories in the solo classes and Sidecar TT, including Ian Hutchinson's clean sweep at the 2010 races.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years after his 1994 release from prison, Chávez {{maintained}} a position against participation in elections, believing them a fixed game which merely legitimated the established order. This led to a split with his colleague Francisco Arias Cárdenas, who left the MBR-200. In the early years after his release, Chávez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections, arguing that Chávez could potentially win so convincingly that the establishment {{would not be able to}} deny him victory. To find out whether this was the case, Chávez set up teams of psychologists, sociologists, university professors and students to carry out a survey. With their support, grassroots members of the Bolivarian movement polled tens of thousands of people across the country. The results showed that 70% of respondents supported Chávez running for the presidency - and 57% said they would vote for him. Support for the electoral route was strengthened when Arias Cárdenas, as a candidate for Radical Cause, won the Governorship of Zulia State in the December 1995 regional elections. Despite this, the MBR-200 remained divided over electoral participation, and spent a year debating the issue in local, regional and national assemblies. A national congress on 19 April 1997 took from 9 am until 2 am the next day to reach a conclusion, ultimately deciding to launch Chávez' candidacy. Some members of the movement resigned in protest, holding <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> stake. In July 1997 Chávez registered the new Fifth Republic Movement with the National Electoral Council (the name had to be changed as Venezuelan law did not permit parties to use Simón Bolívar's name). The international media took little interest, citing opinion polls showing 8% support for Chávez.|$|E

The purchase of the milk delivery job was not convincing and the milkman talked <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the camera; otherwise the picture is not seriously defective in detail."

500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season premiered in Los Angeles on September 23, 2015, with the season, {{consisting}} of 22 episodes, airing on ABC beginning on September 29, 2015 until May 17, 2016. The premiere was watched by 4.90 million viewers, higher than any {{episode of the}} entire second half of season two. Overall, the season had generally consistent ratings, and received positive reviews; critics felt the series had 'hit its stride' with the season, and particularly praised the risky bottle episode [...] "4,722 Hours", though the pacing of the season received criticism for trying to do <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> times. The series was renewed for a fourth season on March 3, 2016.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "The War of the Simpsons" [...] felt [...] "a bit flat", but [...] "even in [...] lowest points, humor is easy to find."

Each of these portions of the episode are filled with laughs, perhaps the funniest being Homer's distorted high-society recollection of the previous night's events in which he is hailed as charming and a jolly good fellow." ...|$|E
500|$|Although TV Zones Stephen Graves {{believed}} that Ben Browder and Claudia Black's first post-Farscape encounter in [...] "Avalon" [...] was [...] "somewhat underplayed", he considered Mitchell's introduction entertaining, with Mitchell's [...] "excruciating" [...] interviews with potential new recruits as [...] "a particular highlight". However, Graves {{was disappointed that}} Mitchell did not contribute much to the story after the knight fight, and that Mitchell's [...] "frantic" [...] efforts to get the old SG-1 team back together hinted <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the production team's efforts to turn around the season 8 finale. While some fans were upset that Carter did not resume command of the SG-1 team after her return, Leonard Fischer of The Seattle Times considered Browder and Michael Shanks to have developed [...] "some fun on-screen rapport" [...] {{by the middle of}} season 9.|$|E

'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time.

500|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. [...] Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. [...] Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. [...] A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical.

500|$|The episode {{generally}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding that {{it to be}} ambitious but ultimately feeling that it attempted <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> once. VanDerWerff found the episode [...] "entertaining", but added that it [...] "feels like something that’s been rewritten at least one time too many, to incorporate more and more ideas until the center cannot hold". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, praising Williams' guest appearance. Gibron also felt positively about the episode's complexity, feeling that it displayed [...] "a certain intelligence" [...] in assuming such a pace. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Sense and Antisense" [...] two stars out of five, describing it as [...] "too thin and too obvious". Shearman praised Williams' guest appearance, but felt that the episode seemed too close thematically to The X-Files to work well on its own.|$|E

500|$|Andy Shaw of Grovel on {{the other}} hand had a more {{negative}} response, praising the artwork of Dave McKean and calling it [...] "brilliant", but criticized Morrison's story as claustrophobic and [...] "has more ponderous psychology than action and, as a result, not enough room to fit any decent action in." [...] Shaw would later add that Morrison's work [...] "doesn't stand up to his rivals," [...] and that [...] "mixing the history of the asylum – famous dumping ground for Batman's psychotic foes – with a typical Batman adventure is interesting enough, but Morrison throws <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the hero in too small a space. This makes Batman's journey through Arkham's finest nutters appear too easy – more of a stroll through a fairground haunted house with a few old chums than a serious battle for his life. Coupled with an anti-climatic ending, there's little feeling of impending disaster – the chronicled event should probably appear in Batman's casebook of over-hyped walkovers."
