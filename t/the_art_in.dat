5|$|Photography in Denmark has {{developed}} from strong participation {{and interest in}} the very beginnings of <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> 1839 {{to the success of}} a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today.

Although Denmark was slow to accept photography as an art form, Danish photographers are now increasingly active, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond the state of <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E

K.) Chiba to the UK to continue the work Abbe had begun. Henry O'Tani (2009) has stated that during Abbe's absence from the UK, a dismissed BJC senior executive and several senior instructors misappropriated his financial and organisational resources and set up their own BJC group. In 1969, Abbe {{returned to}} the UK, but was distraught by the situation with this group that he had not authorised. When he asked former colleagues to help him rebuild the organisation, they refused; he subsequently left the UK, never to return.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Tomoyo After {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} {{the appeal of the}} title character Tomoyo. Being a spin-off of Clannad, where Tomoyo is one of the game's heroines, Tomoyo After provides an expansion of Tomoyo's story after the events of Clannad and is written by Jun Maeda and Leo Kashida. The art was done by Fumio, as opposed to Itaru Hinoue who had done <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> Clannad. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more afterwards. A manga adaptation illustrated by Yukiko Sumiyoshi, under the title Tomoyo After: Dear Shining Memories, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's Dragon Age Pure in 2007. Unlike the game which is told from Tomoya's point of view, the manga is told from Tomoyo's perspective. A single tankōbon volume was released in Japan in December 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{along the}} UTA TRAX network are open-air structures featuring passenger canopies {{for protection from}} adverse weather. Many of the canopies are designed to resemble the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building (which is located Downtown and listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Works of public art included at several stations were developed {{as part of the}} UTA's Art in Transit program. At first the program was met with skepticism; initially, only the stations constructed in Salt Lake City incorporated public art into their designs. This was the case as the city was initially the only one to take part in <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> Transit program. The program has since grown in popularity, and many of the stations constructed as part of the FrontLines 2015 expansion will include public art in their final design.|$|E
