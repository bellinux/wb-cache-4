5|$|Ectoparasites known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> weasels {{include the}} louse Trichodectes mustelae and the mites Demodex and Psoregates mustela. The species may catch fleas from the nests and burrows of its prey. Flea species known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> weasels include Ctenophthalmus bisoctodentatus and Palaeopsylla m. minor, which {{they get from}} moles, P. s. soricis, which they get from shrews, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, which they get from rodents and Dasypsyllus gallinulae which they get from birds.|$|E
5|$|Helminths known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> weasels {{include the}} {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes have been known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is {{a significant factor in}} nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{response}} of the herbivorous mite Tetranychus urticae to uninfested lima bean leaves exposed to herbivore-induced conspecific plant volatiles by using a Y-tube olfactometer. First, we confirmed that exposed uninfested leaves next <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> leaves were more attractive to carnivorous mites Phytoseiulus persimilis than uninfested leaves next to uninfested conspecific leaves. Under the same conditions, uninfested leaves next <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> conspecific leaves were more attractive to T urticae than uninfested leaves next to uninfested leaves. Based on these data, we discuss the role of the volatiles from the exposed plants in a tritrophic system...|$|R
40|$|Based on USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database, {{relationships}} between the presence of tallow tree and related driving variables including forest landscape metrics, stand and site conditions, as well as natural and anthropogenic disturbances were analyzed for the southern states infested by tallow trees. Of the 9, 966 re-measured FIA plots in eastern Texas, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, 190 plots (1. 9 %) were found <b>to</b> be <b>infested</b> by tallow trees during the new measurement cycle (between 2004 and 2008). Logistic regression showed that the probability for a plot <b>to</b> be <b>infested</b> by tallow trees is significantly related to ecoregion, forest type, stand size class, slope and distance <b>to</b> other <b>infested</b> plots and highways. Tallow trees are mainly distributed in the western Gulf section of coastal plains and flatwoods (16. 4 %), the western section of mid-coastal plains (5. 2 %) and the Atlantic coastal flatwoods section (4. 2 %), where oak-gum-cypress, elm-ash-cottonwood, oak-pine and pine (loblolly pine/shortleaf pine) forests dominate. Younger stands or stands near <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> sites are more prone <b>to</b> be <b>infested.</b> Regionally, southeast Texas and southern Louisiana were the most vulnerable areas with the highest abundance of tallow trees...|$|R
50|$|Another way {{to utilize}} this {{research}} is to synthetically produce the compounds produced by trap crop. Up to 10 different compounds {{have been identified as}} contributing to the egg hatching factor. If these compounds can be produced and delivered <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> fields this would contribute the depletion of cyst nematode eggs.|$|R
5|$|Nafash was a zerg broodmother, {{and leader}} of the Nafash Brood. Hoping to make the Swarm {{stronger}} by evolving {{a way to deal with}} extreme cold, Sarah Kerrigan sent Nafash and her brood <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> Kaldir. After Kerrigan's deinfestation, Nafash sought to create her own Swarm. Shortly after setting up a hive, Nafash moved off into the ice valleys. When the protoss struck, Nafash fell back to prepared positions. The protoss hunted her down and killed her.|$|E
5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{longevity}} and mortality of the camas pocket gopher. It is presumably prey for carnivorous mammals, and its bones {{have been identified in}} regurgitated pellets of raptors such as the great horned owl. Parasites include mites, lice, fleas, roundworms and flatworms. The species' tougher skin may protect it from some fleas known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> Botta's pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher. Mites known to parasitize the camas pocket gopher include Androlaelaps geomys and Echinonyssus femuralis. Some authorities report Androlaelaps fahrenholzi as another parasitic mite, but a later publication did not report it. The chewing louse Geomydoecus oregonus has also been reported.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} mites have adapted <b>to</b> <b>infesting</b> the {{internal}} {{tissues and organs}} of their hosts. Cytodites nudus is a typical species of this type; it infests the air-sacs of birds. Laminosioptes cysticola , the fowl cyst mite is another species of mite internally infesting birds. It has a worldwide distribution.|$|R

5|$|Traveling {{through the}} portal, the humans and Elites {{discover}} an immense artificial structure {{known as the}} Ark, far beyond {{the edges of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force, beginning <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth. The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|The Arbiter {{is saved}} by the tentacled {{creature}} and meets the Master Chief {{in the bowels of}} the installation. The creature, Gravemind, is the leader of the Flood on Installation 05. The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy Flood, humans, and Covenant altogether, and sends both the Arbiter and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> In Amber Clad and spread the Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring. The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.|$|E
40|$|Ticks are ectoparasites {{which are}} {{normally}} seen infesting animals {{and human beings}} and also have been reported from poultry.

25|$|Drosophila is {{commonly}} considered a pest {{due to its}} tendency <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> habitations and establishments where fermenting fruit is found; the flies may collect in homes, restaurants, stores, and other locations. Removal of an infestation can be difficult, as larvae may continue to hatch in nearby fermenting fruit even as the adult population is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s {{non-native}} European rabbits, {{an exotic}} invasive species, began <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> the islands {{as the result}} of the release of domestic rabbits on Smith Island. Rabbits from the San Juan Islands were used later for several introductions of European rabbits into other, usually Midwestern, states. The rabbits are pursued by Eurasian red fox (Vulpes vulpes), another non-native species introduced intermittently through the twentieth century.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of polymer matrix ear tags impregnated with 8. 5 % w/w cypermethrin to 6 wethers following shearing reduced lice to non-detectable levels on 4 {{of them at}} 29 weeks after tagging. At {{the conclusion of the}} study at 45 weeks the mean count of lice on tagged wethers was 3 per sheep compared to 158 on untreated wethers. In a second experiment, 6 non-infected sheep were treated at shearing with cypermethrin tags, 6 with 25 g/l cypermethrin backline formulation, 6 with tags plus backline and 6 were left untreated. Each group was exposed to 6 sheep with moderate to heavy infestations of lice. Compared to controls, all treatments delayed infestation, but cypermethrin tags gave no longer protection than backline treatment. All sheep were infested by 17 weeks after commencement of the study. At 45 weeks mean counts of lice were 38, 27, 20 and 74 respectively for sheep treated with tags, backline formulation, backline plus tags and untreated. Possible reasons for the better effect observed from applying tags <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> sheep than <b>to</b> sheep which were not infected at application but which were subsequently exposed <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> sheep are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Cutaneous {{larva migrans}} (CML) is a {{frequent}} parasitic infestation caused by migration of animal hookworm larvae into the human epidermis. This skin disease is common in warmer climates among people, who have contact with contaminated soil. Clinical manifestation of CML is an itchy, erythematous, linear tract, which appears days to even months after exposure <b>to</b> <b>infested</b> sand or soil. Diagnosis is established on the clinical presentation. We describe a case of CML acquired during a holiday in Brazil. Key words: creeping eruption, cutaneous larva migrans, hookworm infection...|$|R
25|$|Lastly, {{there have}} been {{problems}} with droughts and pest infestations. These include the roundheaded pine beetle, European mistletoe and caterpillars. Some residents see the event as divine will but others place global warming. It is not {{know how much of}} the oaks, junipers and pines that make up most of the forested areas have been compromised but there are visible yellow patches seen in the otherwise green forest. The pests have been able <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> more because trees are weak due to drought conditions.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only do they}} {{thrive in}} urban areas, red {{imported}} fire ants can damage equipment and infrastructure and impact business, land, and property values. They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment. Colonies aggregate near electrical fields and are capable of causing short circuits or interfering with switches and equipment such as air conditioners, computers, and water pumps. They are also known <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> airport landing areas and traffic lights.|$|E
25|$|More than 100 insects {{have been}} {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> hickory trees and wood products, {{but only a few}} cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and {{also one of the most}} important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During drought periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds.|$|E

50|$|Some genera of mites {{have adapted}} <b>to</b> <b>infesting</b> the lungs and air-sacs of birds or the lungs of mammals. Cytodites nudus {{is a typical}} species of this type. It infests poultry in North America and South Africa and may cause {{reduction}} in productivity of the birds. Another genus of similar bird infesting mites is Laminosioptes. The genus Pneumocoptes has species that infest the lungs of some monkey and rodent species. These mites aggregate in nodules within the lung but signs of clinical disease are not obvious. Pneumonyssus caninum infests the nasal sinuses of dogs.|$|R
500|$|Coyotes can be {{infected}} by both demodectic and sarcoptic mange, {{the latter being}} the most common. Mite infestations are rare and incidental in coyotes, while tick infestations are more common, with seasonal peaks depending on locality (May–August in the Northwest, March–November in Arkansas). Coyotes are only rarely infested with lice, while fleas infest coyotes from puphood, {{though they may be}} more a source of irritation than serious illness. Pulex simulans is the most common species <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> coyotes, while Ctenocephalides canis tends to occur only in areas where coyotes and dogs (its primary host) inhabit the same area. Although coyotes are rarely host to flukes, they can nevertheless have serious effects on coyotes, particularly Nanophyetus salmincola, which can infect them with salmon poisoning disease, a disease with a 90% mortality rate. Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect coyotes. Tapeworms have been recorded <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> 60–95% of all coyotes examined. The most common species <b>to</b> <b>infest</b> coyotes is Taenia pisiformis and T. crassiceps, which uses cottontail rabbits as intermediate hosts. The largest species known in coyotes is T. hydatigena, which enters coyotes through infected ungulates, and can grow to lengths of [...] Though once largely limited to wolves, Echinococcus granulosus has expanded to coyotes since the latter began colonizing former wolf ranges. The most frequent ascaroid roundworm in coyotes is Toxascaris leonina, which dwells in the coyote's small intestine and has no ill effects, except for causing the host to eat more frequently. Hookworms of the genus Ancylostoma infest coyotes throughout their range, being particularly prevalent in humid areas. In areas of high moisture, such as coastal Texas, coyotes can carry up to 250 hookworms each. The blood-drinking A. caninum is particularly dangerous, as it damages the coyote through blood loss and lung congestion. A 10-day-old pup can die from being host to as few as 25 A. caninum worms.|$|E

500|$|Militarily, the Combine {{make use}} of both {{synthetic}} machines—machines powered by organic components—and traditional mechanical machines such as armored personnel carriers and attack helicopters. The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like gunships; and Striders, [...] armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret. In Episode Two, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, the Hunter, is introduced. These 2.5m (8ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen {{near the end of}} the Half-Life 2, although their roles are not elaborated on. Sentry turrets are also used by the Combine.
