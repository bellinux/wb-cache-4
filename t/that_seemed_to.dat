5|$|His {{marriage}} with Jobst soon collapsed and they divorced. He married twice thereafter and his third wife, Helga Schröck (whom he married in May 1959), {{gave birth to}} a son, Hermann-Ulrich, in 1959, and a daughter, Birgit, in 1961. In 1965, Graf was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a condition <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> affect many former high-altitude flyers and which caused his health to slowly deteriorate. Graf died in his hometown of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{planet was}} one of 700 {{planetary}} candidates considered by Kepler in its first 43 days of operation.

Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were confirmed as the first planets discovered to transit the same star.|$|E
5|$|When Bolognesi was re-writing the screenplay, Bodanzky {{suggested}} that he listen to Arnaldo Antunes' music.

From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress {{passed a}} series of laws <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{series in}} the West Indies ended in another {{whitewash}} with the West Indies winning each Test comfortably, the closest match being a seven wicket victory. Like the previous series the English batsmen provided little resistance against the West Indian bowlers with only Gower averaging above 30. Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with big players such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be shared by the general public at the time.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> say that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could have been changed to 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the value of traditional craft skills <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be disappearing in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur {{had to be the}} top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Legions {{decreased}} {{after the}} Treaty of Luneville (9 February 1801), which to the disappointment of the legionnaires {{made no mention of}} Poland. The Legions was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria. The Legions' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence. Many legionnaires, including General Kniaziewicz, felt that they had been used by the French and resigned. Dąbrowski remained in command, and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801. On 21 December 1801 the Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades, with the Italian (First) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi-Brigades (1er and 2e Demi-Brigade Étrangère), and the Danube (Second) Legion, the Third Foreign Demi-Brigade (3e Demi-Brigade Étrangère).|$|E
