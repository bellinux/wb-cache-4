500|$|The A-4 {{ballistic}} missile (referred {{to as the}} V-2 from September 1944) {{was developed by the}} Germans between 1939 and 1944. It was regarded by Adolf Hitler as a Wunderwaffe (wonder weapon) that he believed to be capable of turning the tide of the war. Its operational deployment was restricted by several factors. Large supplies of cryogenic liquid oxygen (LOX) were required as the oxidizer to fuel the missiles. LOX evaporates rapidly, necessitating a source reasonably close to the firing site in order to minimise loss through evaporation. Germany and the occupied countries did not at that time have sufficient manufacturing capacity for the amount of LOX required for a full-scale A-4 campaign; the <b>total</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> in 1941 and 1942 was about 215 tons daily, but each A-4 launch required about 15 tons.|$|E
