Mdlle. Trista thought fit to trouble my first lessons with a coarse work-day sort of turbulence; she made noises with her mouth like a horse, she ejected her saliva, she uttered brutal expressions; behind and below her were seated a band of very vulgar, inferior-looking Flamandes, including two or three examples of that deformity of person and imbecility of intellect whose frequency in the Low Countries would seem <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>proof</b> that the climate is such as to induce degeneracy of the human mind and body; these, I soon found, were completely under her influence, and with their aid she got up and sustained a swinish tumult, which I was constrained at last to quell by ordering her and two of her tools to rise from their seats, and, having kept them standing five minutes, turning them bodily out of the schoolroom: the accomplices into a large place adjoining called the grands salle; the principal into a cabinet, of which I closed the door and pocketed the key. This judgment I executed in the presence of Mdlle. Reuter, who looked much aghast at beholding so decided a proceeding--the most severe that had ever been ventured on in her establishment. Her look of affright I answered with one of composure, and finally with a smile, which perhaps flattered, and certainly soothed her. Juanna Trista remained in Europe long enough to repay, by malevolence and ingratitude, all who had ever done her a good turn; and she then went to join her father in the---- Isles, exulting in the thought that she should there have slaves, whom, as she said, she could kick and strike at will.|$|E

40|$|Objective and {{intention}} of this thesis were the differentiation of Europes most widely spread horse cestodes species Anoplocephala perfoliata and Paranoplocephala mamillana {{by means of}} PCR {{and the development of}} new primers. Based on proglottides of both cestodes species, a sequence of the mitochondrial DNA was amplified by platyhelminthes specific cytochrome c oxidase subunit I primer (COI primer). After sequencing, discriminate primers were constructed based on the amplifications of both species. For the most frequent horse cestodes species, species specific primers could be synthesised (AP-primer and PM-primer). In the tests run in this study, these primers attained an analytic specificity of 100 %. By means of continuing dilution, the analytical sensitivity of both primer-pairs were determined. The Anoplocephala perfoliata-Primer (AP 72 L/ 341 R) showed a detection sensitivity of approximately 12, 5 pg DNA and for the Paranoplocephala mamillana-Primer (PM 26 L/ 346 R) a detection sensitivity of approximately 1, 65 pg DNA was determined.

40|$|It is the prevaffing {{opinion and}} some of the {{pharmacological}} texts (Sollmann (1), Cushny (2)) teach that man, by repeated use of cocaine, builds up a tolerance which allows him to use amounts that would previously have been toxic or even fatal. Hildebrandt (3), on the contrary, believes that there is no resistance acquired by continued use. He believes the large dosages attained by some cocainists to be explicable on a basis of individual resistance to the drug inasmuch as there is an enor-mous variation in the quantity required to cause intoxication in different individuals of the same species. Similarly, Joel (4) points out that Even the large doses of cocaine addicts and their attainment by gradual increase are not alone sufficient <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>proof</b> of actual ac-quired tolerance to the poison. Clinical tolerance should not be spoken of except where the statement specifically accompanies it that the initial dose had become incapable, after a period, of producing the co-caine effect, that its effective period had perceptibly diminished. The very significant fact remains that the cocaine user, after a voluntary or compulsory interval of six or eight months without cocaine, can resume without harm the same dose at which he discontinued the drug. In morphinists who begin anew, so to speak, on every reversion, this is inconceivable. Although, therefore, in contrast to morphine, we con-sider a tolerance to cocaine in the pharmacological sense as unproved, we are compelled to recognize explicitly the fact of a passionate addic-tion.

Data were collected for around 64 % of patients in one hospital. Evaluation of the questionnaires revealed that there was {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of complications in line with an increasing duration of the indwelling period of between 24 and 96 hours. The unexpected finding of this evaluation study was that in the case of catheters with an indwelling period of more than two days there were highly significantly lower complication rates in those cases in which hand disinfection was carried out or gloves donned before catheter placement. The second study, based on the former, documented the cases giving rise to complications. The proportion of peripheral venous catheters implicated in complications was 24 %. Here, too, there was a sharp rise in the risk of complications in line with the duration of the indwelling period. Catheters placed in the OR during the patient’s hospital stay showed a significantly lower risk of complications than those inserted on wards, or even in the outpatient department. Conductance of hygienic hand disinfection or the wearing of disposable gloves resulted in significantly lower complication rates compared to normal handwashing or omission of a hand hygiene measure. The most plausible explanation for this positive effect exerted by the wearing of disposable gloves or conductance of hygienic hand disinfection prior to catheter placement is that there was no recontamination during repalpation, as often seen, of the prepared venepuncture site...|$|E
40|$|In {{infectious}} diseases we can discern a {{cause and effect}} chain, which in particular offers the practicable perspectives of prophylaxis and treatment. However, to date {{we have not been}} able to control them. Apart from new epidemics, such as those caused by HIV and SARS, long-forgotten scourges like TB are enjoying a comeback. Furthermore, the advances made in clinical medicine mean that induced immunosuppression, for instance as a result of major surgery or organ transplantation, has become a serious problem in intensive care units. The body’s natural barriers are breached through medical interventions while, on the other hand, immunocompromising therapeutic agents such as cytostacis and glucocorticoids ensure that invading microorganisms will be able to multiply. Drugs administered as stress ulcus prophylaxis give rise to a shift in the bacterial flora of the throat, thus laying the foundation for a lower respiratory tract infection. With regard to bacterial resistance, antibiotic therapy, especially when used as prophylaxis, results in the bacteria becoming less sensitive to the drugs, while reinforcing selective pressures. The hands of personnel as well as the therapeutic devices ranging from the respirator to the catheter are the chief sources of infection in intensive care units. Disinfection, antibiotic therapy and, possibly, extracorporeal elimination methods can be contemplated to selectively prevent the establishment and multiplication of microorganisms. However, only disinfectants are able to unleash their full destructive might against microbes, especially when used for medical devices that are not amenable to sterilization, even if their subsequent removal and, possibly, the issue of staff hand protection, can be a problem. While it is not easy <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>proof</b> of a direct link between efficient control and prevention methods and the incidence of infection, there is by now a consensus on the role of hand hygiene and of disinfection of the human body and of surfaces. In an age when medicine, in particular intensive care medicine, is at risk of becoming impaled on its own sword, disinfection could serve as a bulwark against rising infection rates...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{technical}} oil-production the lipids are released by compression and extraction with hexan. Characteristical for rapeseed is the enormous hexan-retention in meal and the delayed release of hexan {{in the surrounding}} area. Cause: the lipids, which are locked in the very compact hulls. - The environmental protection integrated {{in the process of}} production requires a reduction/avoidance of hexan-emission. The solution: partial detachment of the hulls as an head-end-operation. A process to dehull rapeseed is known since 1979. In the opinion of oil millers dehulled rapeseed is not continuously pressable {{due to the lack of}} stability of compressed solid. The aim of the project is <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>proof</b> of the possibility to press rapeseed. Therefore two experimental ways are necessary: To find out the characteristics of the material under an axial compression and the variation of material- end compression-parameter, research of the screw-press process with a constant stream of compressed material and an ejection of a stable expeller with a variation of the geometric-, process- and material-parameter. Results: (A) dehulled rapeseed (hulls reduced to 1 / 4) can be pressed in a screw-press (40 kg/h) continuously; after upscaling the press to a semitechnical press an emission-reduced rapeseed-technology is possible. (B) When rapeseed is pressed, friction and therefore a heat-up is clearly reduced; the oil leaves the press with 40 C; a gentle production of oil is possible; user: Teutoburger Oelmuehle, Ibbenbueren.

Der Weg: partielles Abtrennen der Huellen als Head-end-Prozessstufe. Ein Schaelverfahren fuer Rapssaat ist seit 1979 bekannt. Bei Oelmuellern gilt geschaelter Raps wegen mangelnder Komprimat-Stabilitaet als kontinuierlich nicht pressbar. -Vorhabensziel ist der Nachweis der kontinuierlichen Pressbarkeit von Schaelraps. - Erforderlich sind zwei experimentelle Arbeitswege: (1) Ermittlung der Merkmale unter axialer Kompression bei Variation der Material- und Kompressions-Parameter, (2) Studium der Seiher-Schneckenpresse bei konstantem Komprimatstrom und Auswurf eines stabilen Schilfers bei Variation der Geometrie-, Betriebs- und Material-Parameter. - Ergebnisse: (A) Schaelraps (Huellen reduziert auf 1 / 4) ist auf einer Schneckenpresse (40 kg/h) kontinuierlich pressbar; nach Upscaling der Presse in den (halb-) technischen Massstab ist emissionsarme Rapssaatverarbeitung moeglich.

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} term 'Aboriginal art' {{through a number}} of {{different}} genres of published literature in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In surveying the journals of early explorers, the field reports of naturalists, geologists and ethnologists, and the major contributions to Australian anthropology in the years 1802 - 1929, an historical account of the beginnings of the category 'Aboriginal art' is formed. This thesis argues that 'Aboriginal art', as a categorisation, is a construction resulting mostly from the combined effects of the interpretation and reinterpretation on certain published accounts, dating from the time of first contact. Even work in the field can be understood in this manner, as preconceived notions often shaped its focus and methodology and also because the results of fieldwork are often reinterpreted by other writers <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>proof</b> for their own theorems. As such, 'Aboriginal art', in the period under investigation, is defined by its reception rather than by any attempt to recognise what the artist may have originally intended or to make links between works based on their appearance. When the literature on 'Aboriginal art' is viewed en masse, certain topics predominate such as origin, authenticity and imitation. These topics are treated as thematic bases in the thesis around which chapters are formed. These chapters are also loosely chronological, beginning with accounts left by the first European explorers to come into contact with what is later know as 'Aboriginal art'. Certain beliefs and prejudices are perpetuated when secondary accounts relay these first encounters to wider audiences. The occupation and motivations of the various authors come into play when interpreting these texts, as do the dominant ideologies and methodological approaches of the day. Each of these factors affecting the production and reception of writing on 'Aboriginal art' is addressed in course of this investigation. Similarly, key events such as the International and Intercolonial Exhibitions and the opening of the first museums are analysed in relation to their impact on the writing on 'Aboriginal art'. The end date for this study is set by the exhibition, Australian Aboriginal Art (1929), staged in Melbourne at the combined National Gallery and National Museum of Victoria. This event and the writing contemporaneous with it does not signal the end of 'Aboriginal art' but instead signals that the term has gained sufficient currency to have a readily recognisable meaning, and connotes certain objects, ideas and values. 0020 Although the literature surveyed throughout this thesis demonstrates that there was little consensus reached in relation to the qualities, value and meaning of 'Aboriginal art', there is strong evidence to suggest that certain texts and authors were better suited or better able to disseminate their work than others. This thesis outlines one history of 'Aboriginal art' in the nineteenth century; a history constructed from the published accounts left by conservative, mostly middle class, white men. It is the opinions conveyed by these writers that shaped the public's perception of 'Aboriginal ait' at the time. It is the task of this thesis to determine the main themes and currents running through the bulk of this literature...|$|E

For topological spaces Xi (i∈I) and J⊆I, set XJ:=∏i∈JXi. The authors prove a general theorem concerning κ-box topologies and pseudo-(α,κ) -compact spaces, of which the following is a corollary of the special case κ=α=ω. TheoremIf Y⊆XI and πJ[Y]=XJ for all ∅≠J∈[I]<ω+, and if each XJ, for ∅≠J∈[I]<ω, is Lindelöf, then Y is M-embedded in XI. RemarkSeveral results in Chapter 10 of the book [W. W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, Chain Conditions in Topology, Cambridge Tracts in Math., vol. 79, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982] depend on Lemma 10. 1, of which the given proof was incomplete. A principal contribution here is <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> a correct <b>proof,</b> allowing the present authors to verify and unify all the results from Chapter 10 whose status had become questionable, and to extend several of these...|$|R
