60|$|Lys. My lord Philocles, I'm glad we are alone; There is a business, <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> nearly, In which I {{beg your}} love.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all,' said John; 'there {{is nothing}} I wish more to hear, or <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> more nearly. Anything {{you like to}} tell.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{change is}} there in YOU, Martin,' she replied; 'for <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> nearest? You look more anxious and more {{thoughtful}} than you used.' ...|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA. I cannot {{believe that}} any one has any right even to think about things <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> only. (She turns away from them to conceal a painful {{struggle}} with her emotion.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{intentions}} were, no doubt, good, {{but please}} remember in future that I can't permit things <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> {{to be taken}} out of my hands. I believe I'm still capable of managing my affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how does}} <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> <b>me?</b> She {{was not my}} granddaughter. I, at least, {{had nothing to do}} with it. Excuse me, Harcourt, if I say that I, of all men, am the last to whom you should address {{yourself}} on such a subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me,</b> lady," [...] Varney {{replied with}} humility. [...] "But, think you, honoured madam, that your lord will hear it with equal equanimity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must confess}} that I don't find it quite as {{unpleasant}} as I had expected. But you haven't given me your {{opinion on the}} point <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> most." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} to rest and recover myself. I can't rest. I have come back to these leaves. There is much to be written in them since Midwinter has been here, <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> nearly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Don Ippolito, with a {{sigh and}} smile of relief, [...] "that is immeasurably better. I wish I could speak to you, dear friend, in a mood of yours as {{sympathetic}} as this picture records, of some matters <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> very nearly. I have just come from the railroad station." ...|$|R
5000|$|While growing up, Marques became {{disturbed}} by the worsening state of his country: “I {{had never heard of}} a lawyer, had no idea of what human rights were, no idea of what fighting corruption was”, he later recalled. “I realised that the way of addressing the issues <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> was by being a journalist.” ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [not at all pleased] Did she? Hm! My {{mother has}} rather {{a trick of}} taking me by {{surprise}}--to see how I behave myself while she's away, I suppose. I fancy I shall take my mother very much by surprise one of these days, if she makes arrangements <b>that</b> <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> without consulting me beforehand. She hasnt come.|$|R
6000|$|Here I interposed: [...] "The only {{question}} <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> {{at this stage}} is: Does the table tip and the brush really fly? No physical fact is trivial, for it stands related to mountains and the clouds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder whether}} he will ever see his own harshness?' said Guy. 'It is very strange, that with all his {{excellence}} and real kindness, {{there should be some}} distortion in his view of all <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me.</b> I cannot understand it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} you persuaded me {{to listen to you}} on the pretence that you had news to tell me of the doings at Waterloo--news on which my {{happiness}} depended. You have not told me a single fact <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> in the least." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stood with}} {{throbbing}} pulses, and waited, instinctively warned <b>that</b> this <b>concerned</b> <b>me.</b> The inquisitor took the parchment, considered its seals {{and then the}} writing upon it.|$|R
60|$|SIR PEARCE. And now, Mrs. O'Flaherty, I daresay {{you have}} a great deal to say to Dennis <b>that</b> doesn't <b>concern</b> <b>me.</b> I'll just go in and order tea.|$|R
6000|$|... "For myself, I cannot sleep," [...] said he. [...] "I have matters <b>that</b> it <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> {{to meditate}} upon. I will watch the fire, as I {{used to do}} in the old time." ...|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. I dont care a tinker's curse {{who you are}} or {{what you}} are. Youre willing to take that girl off my hands for fifteen hundred a year: thats all <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me.</b> Tell her who you are if you like: it's her affair, not mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sluggish," [...] muttered Kenyon, to himself; [...] "a weak, nerveless fool, {{devoid of}} energy and promptitude; or neither Donatello nor Miriam could have escaped me thus! They are aware of some misfortune <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> deeply. How soon am I to know it too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Edith, my darling," [...] he said, {{taking her}} hand and {{pressing}} it between both his own as was often the wont {{with him in his}} more affectionate moods. [...] "I want to speak to you--on business <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> nearly; may perhaps concern us all nearly. Can you give me half an hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is enough," [...] Beorn said. [...] "Anything <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> Wulf <b>concerns</b> <b>me,</b> {{and as he}} is in {{the matter}} you can count on me without question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am decidedly {{of opinion}} {{that he is}} responsible. He has wished to [...] be thought {{partially}} deranged, or {{on the brink of}} it, to perplex [...] observers and prevent them from tracing effects to their real causes [...] through all the intricacies of his conduct. I was, as I told you, at [...] one time the dupe of his acted insanity, and clung to the former [...] delusions in regard to the motives <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> personally, till [...] the whole system was laid bare.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to such New York-originated live entertainment shows {{of the period}} as Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater, Balderson covered news {{events such as the}} inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower as President of the U.S. in 1953, and was selected to be the sole pool cameraman inside the White House for Ike's meeting with outgoing President Harry S. Truman on Inauguration Day. Balderson later recalled the occasion in a newspaper interview: [...] "I think this was probably my greatest thrill. I was feeding pictures to NBC, CBS, ABC. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> was <b>that</b> something might happen to the camera. [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We gain nothing by {{discussing}} the matter," [...] said Maenck shortly. [...] "You are Leopold of Lutha. Prince Peter {{says that you}} are mad. All <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> {{is that you do}} not escape again, and you may rest assured that while Ernst Maenck is governor of Blentz you shall not escape and go at large again.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{matter for}} my thoughts, sir," [...] said the Earl; [...] "proceed. You have as yet spoken of {{yourself}} only--an important and worthy subject doubtless, but which, perhaps, does not altogether so deeply concern me that I should postpone my repose to hear it. Spare me further prelude, sir, {{and speak to}} the purpose if indeed you have aught to say <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me.</b> When you have done, I, in my turn, have something to communicate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen to me, young lady; and don't whine {{when you}} have no occasion, or I may make some for you. If I find him in my house again, or find that you have seen him in anybody else's house, you'll repent it. If you are not deaf and dumb to {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me,</b> unless you have my leave to hear and speak, you'll repent it. If you don't obey exactly what I order, you'll repent it. Now, attend. What's the time?' ...|$|E
50|$|We Dive at Dawn {{was filmed}} at Gaumont-British Studios in London, with the {{co-operation}} of the British Admiralty. John Mills prepared {{for his role}} as the captain of Sea Tiger by riding on a submarine on a training mission down the Clyde. He recalled a crash dive: The ship then seemed to stand on her nose and I felt her speeding like an arrow towards the sea bed; charts and crockery went flying in all directions; I hung on to a rail near the periscope trying to look heroic and totally unconcerned; the only thing <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> was the fact that I was sure that my face had turned a pale shade of pea-green.|$|R
5000|$|In effect I endow certain {{isolated}} musical {{moments with}} faces, and so with tongues {{and a special}} sonorous presence. I construct voices out of musical discourse. The questions <b>that</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> are: How does this constructed [...] "they" [...] seem to speak? Why do we hear them? What is their force? Precisely which musical gestures {{can be read as}} betraying their presence? All six of the succeeding chapters attempt to recover these voices, which -- hence one sense of my title--have to me been overlooked, unsung. Sensitivity to this constructed presence means possessing that [...] "second hearing" [...] (an aural form of [...] "second sight"), which reanimates, I hope, a sense for what is uncanny in music. Carolyn Abbate ...|$|R
60|$|O'FLAHERTY [respectfully but doggedly]. And there's {{another thing}} it's taught <b>me</b> too, sir, <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> you and <b>me,</b> if I may make bold {{to tell it}} to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't I come to it, Mr. Bucket?" [...] cries Grandfather Smallweed. [...] "Isn't {{the gentleman}} {{concerned}} yet? Not with Captain Hawdon, and his ever affectionate Honoria, and their {{child into the}} bargain? Come, then, I {{want to know where}} those letters are. <b>That</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me,</b> if it don't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock. I will know where they are. I won't have 'em disappear so quietly. I handed 'em over to my friend and solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, not to anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|They had halted {{before her}} door, and she pressed his arm gratefully. [...] "I am not angry, Matt. But with the {{exception}} of my father you are the only person I would have permitted {{to talk to me about}} this--this affair in the way you have. And though I like you, Matt, love you better than ever, I shall nevertheless be very angry if you mention it again. You have no right. It is something <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> alone. And it is wrong of you--" ...|$|E
60|$|What I must do is all <b>that</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me,</b> {{not what}} the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in {{intellectual}} life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy {{in the world to}} live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who {{in the midst of the}} crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} persisted, were it but {{in hopes of}} his letting drop <b>that</b> which it <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> to know, but he cut off further communication, by {{desiring}} me to lean back {{in the corner and}} go to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{make the}} man hear reason," [...] he {{informed}} his wife. [...] "In fact, he practically {{told me that}} the thing was no concern of mine. I assured him <b>that</b> it <b>concerned</b> <b>me</b> directly as one of the executors of Harry's will, and I'm afraid I afterwards indulged in a few personalities. I expect that blamed mortgage broker has got a very strong hold on him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot said: [...] "I pray {{you that}} this be all as secret as possible, and <b>that</b> no word <b>concerning</b> <b>me</b> goes beyond these walls." [...] And King Pelles said, [...] "It shall be as you would have it, Messire." ...|$|R
