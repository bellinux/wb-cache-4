5|$|Saturday is McEwan's ninth novel, {{published}} between Atonement and On Chesil Beach, {{two novels}} of historical fiction. McEwan has discussed that {{he prefers to}} alternate between writing about <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} item is the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> In {{the course of}} the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E

25|$|Finally, all the {{characters}} of the parade began to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> is another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music began a crescendo with choruses, {{when all of a}} sudden an olive tree was lifted from the center of the pool - symbolizing goddess Athena's preferred gift by the Greeks - land and food - over Poseidon's gift, the horse - a tool of warfare. At the music's climax, all {{the characters}} stopped and raised their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which was high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resembled a mount.|$|E
25|$|As {{is common}} with most Egyptian archeology, the plundering and {{destructive}} excavation of tombs, both in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> for tomb riches, has hindered {{the ability to}} gain as much knowledge about retainer sacrifices as would be available if the tombs were intact. Dr. O'Connor does believe that retainer sacrifices were the exception, instead of the norm, in ancient Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Islamic Shafi`i jurists {{such as the}} Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa and fiqh scholar Taha Jabir Alalwani {{along with}} Shi'a jurists such as Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri and Grand Ayatollah Hussein Esmaeel al-Sadr and some jurists, {{scholars}} and writers of other Islamic sects, have argued or issued fatwas that the changing of religion is not punishable, but these minority opinions have not found broad acceptance among the majority of Islamic scholars. However others have successfully argued that the majority view, in both <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> wasn't a severe punishment for mere apostasy.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the papers [1 - 4] and is devoted to the riddle of the origin of the arrow of time. The problem of time orientation reduces to that of <b>the</b> difference between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> future. The riddle escapes solution in deterministic dynamics <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> dynamics of standard indeterministic quantum theory as well. In the dynamics of indeterministic quantum gravity, <b>the</b> <b>past</b> is reconstructible uniquely, whereas the future may be forecasted only on a probabilistic level.

25|$|Nomological {{determinism}} is {{the most}} common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof pose a serious challenge to this view. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being physical indeterminism).|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Cubism was {{far-reaching}} and wide-ranging. In other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed {{in response to}} Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people are {{inclined}} to maintain, {{as much as they}} can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E

25|$|America Dreaming (1995) was {{the first}} play written by Chiori Miyagawa. It was {{produced}} by the Music-Theatre Group and Vineyard Theatre. The play follows {{the story of an}} Asian American woman, Yuki, who travels back in time, only to discover that history has been distorted so that certain events, such as the Vietnam War and the imprisonment of Japanese Americans in World War II, did not occur in the memory of Americans. It also is a love story that explores the dynamic between Eastern and Western cultures in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> America Dreaming received a Drama Desk Award Nomination in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Causal {{determinism}} is {{the concept}} that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality {{in such a way}} that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or self-caused. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view.|$|E
25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, {{making it impossible for}} anything else to happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel {{to the left of}} the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions, but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the drive-wheel), representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a fraction of a second earlier, as if to show motion through absence. With this type of game playing with contradictory visual codes (positive and negative space), Metzinger discerns <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> infinitesimally separated in time; while the perception of the future is left to the intellectual discretion of the observer to contemplate.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> The present {{is represented by the}} bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.|$|E

40|$|Rainfall {{statistics}} are composed {{based on data}} gained by precipitation measurements and from climate models.

Influences on the statistically determined precipitation amounts caused by changes can be neglected for past periods. However, significant increases of the statistical precipitation amounts can be observed for the future. Here a pragmatic approach is presented, showing how to consider possible increases in the statistical precipitation amounts – due to the climate change signal – in the dimensioning of water management systems...|$|R

As the Typhon starts breaching the Kalpa, the last batch of breeds, including Jebrassy and Taidba, leave the city in search of help. Armed with portable reality generators, they slowly progress through the unreal landscape in search of the rebel city.|$|E
500|$|In {{repackaging}} {{other publications}} for its readers, the Analytical Review {{participated in the}} encyclopedic movement of the eighteenth century, a movement largely begun by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie. Excited and yet overwhelmed by what they viewed as {{a dramatic increase in}} human knowledge, encyclopedists of the era aimed to organize and classify all of this new knowledge using a new reference system: the encyclopedia. The Analytical Review was part of this project and its editors believed that they were preserving the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> for the future.
