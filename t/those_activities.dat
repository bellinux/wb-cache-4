When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as he did not want any other artist to do it if his voice worsened.

As well, he questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it. Some values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have been critiqued as being therapist-centric and do not reflect the modern reality of multicultural practice.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the park}} was renamed Camp Kidd, after Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd. Buildings within the park were used for {{multiple}} purposes, including hospital wards, training facilities, and barracks. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, many of the wounded were transported to Camp Kidd's hospital wards. Camp Kidd {{also served as a}} Reception Center for sailors until 1944, when <b>those</b> <b>activities</b> were transferred to Camp Elliott; this allowed for additional hospital expansion. It was returned to civilian authority in 1946, and repair costs to return the buildings and infrastructure to their pre-war status totaled $840,000, with the majority reimbursed by the Navy. In 1948, the funds were used to restore seven buildings that were deemed unsafe.|$|E
25|$|MSM are {{not limited}} to small, self-identified, and visible sub-populations. MSM and gay refer to {{different}} things: behaviors and social identities. MSM refers to sexual activities between men, regardless of how they identify, whereas gay can include <b>those</b> <b>activities</b> but is more broadly seen as a cultural identity. Homosexuality refers to sexual/romantic attraction between members of the same sex and may or may not include romantic relationships. Gay is a social identity and is generally the preferred social term, whereas homosexual is used in formal contexts, though the terms are not entirely interchangeable. Men who are non-heterosexual or questioning may identify with all, none, a combination of these, or one of the newer terms indicating a similar sexual, romantic, and cultural identity like bi-curious.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Newly {{emerging}} {{kinds of}} sensors {{are able to}} observe movement of vehicles and people in large areas over long time intervals.

This paper presents a taxonomy {{of different kinds of}} activity structure, and illustrative examples of visualization techniques or automated exploitation algorithms to help expose and understand <b>those</b> <b>activity</b> structures. Key words: Activity recognition; automated exploitation; persistent surveillance; ground sensor network; wide-area motion imagery. 1...|$|R

25|$|PREA authorizes {{money in}} the form of grants {{for a wide variety of}} {{implementation}} associated activities. The grants can be utilized by state agencies for personnel, training, technical assistance, data collection, and equipment to prevent, investigate, and prosecute prison rape. Each state recipient is required to submit a report within 90 days laying out on what activities the money was spent on as well as the effect of <b>those</b> <b>activities</b> on prison rape within the state. In 2004 Congress appropriated US$25 million dollars for the grant program and in 2005 US$20 million. The BJA handed out $10 million of the 2004 appropriation in the fourth quarter of that year. The largest grant amount that year, $1 million, was handed out to the Department of Corrections in Iowa, Michigan, New York, Texas and Washington.|$|E
25|$|Also {{prior to}} the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the Glass–Steagall Act. For example, a few years earlier, {{commercial}} Banks were allowed to pursue investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to begin stock and insurance brokerage. Insurance underwriting was the only main operation they weren't allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act. The Act further enacted three provisions that allow for bank holding companies to engage in physical commodity activities. Prior to the enactment of the Act <b>those</b> <b>activities</b> were limited to those that were so closely related to banking to be considered incidental to it. Under GLBA depending on the provision the institution falls into, bank holding companies can engage in physical commodity trading, energy tolling, energy management services, and merchant banking activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the weir, according to the Council minutes, was designed by the Council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and reinforced steel structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. <b>Those</b> <b>activities</b> were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area {{close to the edge}} of the top of the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting earth bank at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.|$|E
