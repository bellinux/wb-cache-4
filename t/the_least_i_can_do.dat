2500|$|In February 2001, Markhasev sent {{a letter}} to California Deputy Attorney General Kyle Brodie asking that all appeals in his case stop. Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family. It is my duty as a Christian, and it's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> after the great wickedness for which I am responsible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson {{regarding}} Alabama, that [...] "I am {{attempting to}} do <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." [...] Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the [...] "high-visibility" [...] election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists. With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration.|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall install {{myself as}} head nurse," [...] Mrs. Conyers said, decidedly. [...] "We owe {{so much to}} you all, that that is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Erotic Elk {{deals with}} pure synthpop music and <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{say is that}} this album sounds like a real revelation to me! The main {{characteristic}} and strength of this album is its production. The sound is incredibly powerful and I think it's an essential element for qualitative pop music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good many. I don't know. I am {{horrified to}} look back on it, and <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> after it is to come to you like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've {{elevated}} me to a princedom, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{to invite}} you down home for a week-end--down to the San Spirito Presidio. My father's commandant there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{is to take}} it myself," [...] said Geoffrey, smiling to {{hide his}} uneasiness. [...] "I presume you do not wish me to swallow it immediately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am worse, Pa. I make so many {{calculations}} {{how much}} a year I must have when I marry, and what is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> manage to do with, that I am beginning to get wrinkles over my nose. Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening, Pa?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Being poor, Wei did {{not have}} the means to repair the temple. One day, he brought a broom and some incense from his home. He swept the temple clean and lit the incense as an {{offering}} to Guanyin. [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do," [...] he thought to himself. And he did this twice a month for many months.|$|R
6000|$|BENNET. I am old-fashioned {{enough to}} think also of my duty to those I serve. If his lordship has done me the honour to marry my niece, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> is {{to see to it}} that she brings no {{discredit}} to his name. [Mrs. Bennet, followed by Jane Bennet, a severe-looking woman of middle age, has entered upon the words [...] "the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." [...] Bennet stays them a moment with his hand while he finishes. Then he turns to his wife.] You will be interested to find, Susannah, that the new Lady Bantock is not a stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{ought to}} have married your mother if anybody. And as I have not married her, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in respect to her is to marry no other woman.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} get him the Belle of the Tye. 'Tis <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> For I am at my wits' end how to reward him, Dolly. And when are you coming back?" [...] I whispered earnestly, seeing her silent.|$|E
50|$|I met Clarice Lispector at {{the exact}} moment that she {{published}} Near to the Wild Heart. The meeting {{took place in a}} restaurant in Cinelândia. We had lunch and our conversation strayed from literary matters. … <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is that she was stunning. It was autumn, the leaves in the square were falling, and the grayness of the day helped underscore the beauty and luminosity of Clarice Lispector. Alongside the foreign climate was that strange voice, the guttural diction which rings in my ears to this day.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't make it {{convenient}} {{for me to}} exercise the privilege of kickin' yer out to that extent,'" [...] she continued; [...] "'but if I cannot dispense with your room, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is that it's a d--d sight better than your company--'or suthin' like that! And then the way you minded your stops, and let your voice rise and fall just ez easy ez if you wos a First Reader in large type. Why, the Kernel wasn't nowhere. HIS cussin' didn't come within a mile o' yourn. That Stanner jist turned yaller." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'MY DEAR BISHOP OF MELCHESTER,--I {{confess to}} you that your letter, so [...] gracious and {{flattering}} as it is, has taken your friend somewhat [...] unawares. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in return for its contents is to reply [...] as quickly as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't have blamed you either, you know. Most men after a bump {{like that}} might have been spiteful. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to stand you a needle and thread. And a clothes brush. It isn't {{everyone}} who'd have taken it like you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} their outfit upon myself, Francis," [...] the earl said. [...] "My steward shall {{go out with}} them and see to it. It is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> when I am abetting you in depriving my old tutor of his sons." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I realize that. I {{am quite}} a {{stranger}} to you. Nevertheless, my gratitude is your due and I hope you will accept it as <b>the</b> <b>least</b> tribute <b>I</b> <b>can</b> pay you. Of all that throng of bathers, only you noticed my peril and came to my assistance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you {{are making}} a martyr of {{yourself}} in my service, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is lend a hand.

[...] And, throwing off her hat and cloak, Rose beckoned so invitingly that the gravest philosopher would have yielded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Turning {{the lock}} of the door, is he?" [...] said Allan, {{as soon as}} his merriment left him breath enough to speak. [...] "That's a devilish unhandsome action, Master Midwinter, on the part of your ghost. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> after that, is to let mine out of the cabin, and give him the run of the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} you respect me," [...] she began; [...] "I {{am going to}} prove that I believe you. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is not to misinterpret you, on my side. Am I to {{understand}}, Mr. Morris--you won't think the worse of me, I hope, if I speak plainly--am I to understand {{that you are in}} love with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{much longer}} before you can do so again, if I {{go back to the}} Islands with papa. I shall expect you to be true, you know; and it will be ten years at <b>the</b> <b>least</b> before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hope to be home again." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{dedicate}} this dissertation {{to the man}} {{who introduced}} me to nature, to art, and to music; {{to the man who}} taught me that animals are our kin and that, above all, love and family will prevail and provide the necessary strength to challenge authority in the pursuit of justice and ethics. I dedicate this dissertation, an artifact of my education, to my father. A DEEP DESIGN OF ECO-DEMOCRATIC REFORM iii Acknowledgements This dissertation {{would not have been possible}} without a number of people, places, and events to which acknowledgment is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> offer in thanks for all that has been brought to the support of this study.

I shall {{take a little}} watching, but I shan't have to do {{anything}} dreadful, or even, in <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> inconvenient. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do in fact as I like." [...] It was wonderful for Milly how just to put it so made all its pieces fall at present quite properly into places.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready," [...] said Meg, glancing round {{the room at the}} very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you first}} came to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "I thought I should not like you. I have learned to like you--I have learned to be {{grateful}} to you.

"I must apologise, Mr Roy, for the {{presumption}} of my man, in bringing you here under something like false pretences," [...] said the stranger, holding out his hand, which Nigel shook heartily.

6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] Colville proceeded, {{as if he}} {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to do so, [...] "I have had the misfortune--yes, I'm afraid I've had the fault--to make myself very displeasing to Mrs. Bowen, and in such a way that <b>the</b> very <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is to take myself off as far and as soon as I conveniently can." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{glanced at}} Miss Townshead, who, though she wished to, {{could not quite}} check a smile. He was very young, and had a pleasant face. [...] "That was very kind of you," [...] he said. [...] "Now, <b>I</b> think <b>the</b> <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is to retire to the barn or stable.
