5|$|Although {{attachment}} <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> {{become a}} major scientific theory of socioemotional development {{with one of the}} widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice.|$|E

50|$|Many {{tips and}} <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> been {{advanced}} in the case. Although {{most of these}} have been dismissed, two <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> excited considerable interest among the police and media, {{and they have been}} extensively investigated.|$|R
50|$|Various <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> {{been brought}} forward {{in regards to}} the attempt by Mehmet Ali Ağca to kill Pope John Paul II. Those <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> {{involved}} the Grey Wolves, the Bulgarian Secret Service, and others.|$|R
5000|$|According to writer Jeremy Stahl, since Bush left office, {{the overall}} number of believers in 9/11 {{conspiracy}} <b>theories</b> <b>has</b> dipped, {{while the number}} of people who believe in the most [...] "radical" [...] <b>theories</b> <b>has</b> held fairly steady.|$|R
5|$|Attachment <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> {{implications}} {{in residence}} and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness {{while the}} menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5000|$|Design {{theories}} and creativity <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> been developed as separate fields of research. But design theory {{should include the}} creative, surprising and serendipitous aspects of design; while creativity <b>theories</b> <b>have</b> been unable to account for intentional inventive processes common in design fields.|$|R

5|$|Galactic habitable-zone <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} {{due to an}} {{inability}} to quantify accurately the factors making a region of a galaxy favorable {{for the emergence of}} life. In addition, computer simulations suggest that stars may change their orbits around the galactic center significantly, therefore challenging {{at least part of the}} view that some galactic areas are necessarily more life-supporting than others.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been criticised for being inconsistent with {{his belief in}} religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

5|$|Other economists {{believe that}} these {{elements}} cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber's <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is a poorly understood disorder, {{and a number}} of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others.|$|E
5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of potential-flow theory together with boundary-layer theory to airfoil design and analysis was accomplished many years ago.

5|$|The exact {{meaning of}} Keynes's {{work has been}} long debated. Even the {{interpretation}} of Keynes's policy prescription for unemployment, {{one of the more}} explicit parts of General <b>Theory,</b> <b>has</b> been the subject of debates. Economists and scholars debate whether Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address a serious problem or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.|$|E
5|$|The large frill {{also may}} have helped to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature. A similar <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would {{not account for the}} bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.|$|E
5|$|The large frill on Styracosaurus {{and related}} genera {{also may have}} helped to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature, like the ears of the modern elephant.

5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their skin, and the <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that he was}} in danger, Levski {{decided to}} flee to Romania, where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events. First, however, he had to collect {{important}} documentation from the committee archive in Lovech, which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans. He stayed at the nearby village inn in Kakrina, where he was surprised and arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872. Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov the most accepted version has been that a priest named Krastyo Nikiforov betrayed Levski to the police. This <b>theory</b> <b>has</b> been disputed by the researchers Ivan Panchovski and Vasil Boyanov for lack of evidence.|$|E
