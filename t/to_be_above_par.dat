[...] The Times of India also praised the animation, adding that [...] "the special effects ... sizzle and crackle". [...] Anupama Chopra of NDTV Movies gave it a mixed review, calling it a [...] "faithful but dreary retelling".

40|$|Introduction and Purpose: Evaluation of {{performance}} quality {{plays an important}} role in client satisfaction, especially in hospitals as healthcare providers. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quality {{of performance}} of Rajaee Hospital in Tonekabon, Iran. Methods: This descriptive survey was performed in 225 of the staff of Shahid Rajaee Hospital during 2015. The samples were randomly chosen according to Krejcie and Morgan’s table. Performance quality was evaluated using the standard checklist of Malcolm Baldrige model. To analyze the data, one-sample t-test and Friedman test were run, using SPSS 18. Results: The total score of Shahid Rajaee Hospital in terms of performance quality <b>was</b> <b>above</b> <b>par</b> (616. 482 out of 1010). The "standard of results" was in the first rank of Malcolm Baldrige model and "focus on human resources" ranked last in that model. Conclusion: Although the performance quality <b>was</b> <b>above</b> average, shortcoming in terms of factors associated with market and clients accentuates the importance of planning and focusing on improving the factors affecting the quality of performance...|$|R

Using this method, if a stock splits {{and returns to the}} $1.00 value, the owner should sell out and reinvest in a stock that <b>is</b> safely <b>above</b> <b>par.</b> Similarly if a stock drops below a dollar, the owner should sell the shares. This technique relies upon the rule that any money invested in a stock paying dividends will earn a greater return than shares that are not paying dividends.|$|R

The redemption pickup <b>is</b> the <b>above</b> <b>par</b> redemption value in the case of par/par asset swaps, or the redemption above the proceeds notional {{in the case of the}} proceeds asset swap. The proceeds notional equals the dirty nominal price of the bond at the time of purchase and is used as the fixed notional on the LIBOR leg.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{audience}} at Cannes gave a standing ovation to the film when it was screened, the critics have thus far been mixed in their reaction towards the film. Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter, for example, is generous in his praise of the film's social message and visual beauty, claiming that the Li [...] "draws wonderful performances from a cast that includes local amateurs and professionals, including the utterly credible Huang Lu." [...] In contrast, Derek Elley of Variety was far more subdued in his reaction, and in particular criticizes the film's thin story and poorly drawn characters, such that [...] "there's little emotional underpinning to the rote story." [...] What both critics agreed <b>was</b> <b>above</b> <b>par,</b> however, <b>was</b> the photography of the Taiwanese cinematographer Jong Lin. Other critics expressed sentiments similar to Elley, but nevertheless found the performances effective, particularly by the lead actress. Reception was more positive with the Chinese press. Writing in Hong Kong cultural magazine, Muse, Perry Lam observed, 'What makes this film so heartbreaking and so hard <b>to</b> watch sometimes <b>is</b> its determination <b>to</b> let us experience without varnish {{the depths of the}} heroine's despair and meet all the wretched characters who {{have a role to play}} in her tragedy.' ...|$|R
2500|$|These factors <b>are</b> likely <b>to</b> {{change over}} time, so {{the market price}} of a bond will vary after it is issued. The market price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} nominal value. Bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This <b>is</b> referred <b>to</b> as [...] "Pull to Par". At other times, prices can <b>be</b> <b>above</b> <b>par</b> (bond <b>is</b> priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) [...] Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.|$|R

Placed side-by-side, players would be somewhat hard pressed to guess which game was the newer release." [...] He was critical of the lack of differentiation between the game and its predecessor, arguing [...] "it feels more like an expansion than a true sequel. If you've played the first game, Ties That Bind simply feels like more of the same." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind is a solid action title that should satisfy fans of the original game. Although the game doesn't bring a lot of new experiences to the table, it does do a great job of adding to the experience gamers enjoyed the first time around." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "the gameplay feels stuck in the past, like a rerun of the first game." [...] He was critical of the port, citing [...] "graphics glitches," [...] "problems loading saved games," [...] and game-breaking bugs. He concluded, [...] "The gameplay and locales aren't particularly exciting, yet the pacing is taut, and the story and acting <b>are</b> <b>above</b> <b>par.</b> Fans of the first game should enjoy learning more about Torque's clouded life, but if you're new to the series, you're probably better off picking up the original." ...|$|R
