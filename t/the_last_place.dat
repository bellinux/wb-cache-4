5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Place</b> on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century Jacobite Risings, Orkney {{was largely}} Jacobite in its sympathies. At {{the end of}} the 1715 rebellion, a large number of Jacobites who had fled north from {{mainland}} Scotland sought refuge on Orkney and were helped on to safety in Sweden. In 1745, the Jacobite lairds on the islands ensured that Orkney remained pro-Jacobite in outlook, and was a safe place to land supplies from Spain to aid their cause. Orkney was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>place</b> in the British Isles that held out for the Jacobites and was not retaken by the British Government until 24 May 1746, over a month after the defeat of the main Jacobite army at Culloden.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, Dean {{ordered the}} division's three regiments—the US 19th, 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments—to cross the Kum River, {{destroying}} all bridges behind them, {{and to establish}} defensive positions around Taejon. Dean formed a line with the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast. Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and Taegu, giving it great strategic value for both sides. The division was attempting to make a stand at Taejon, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>place</b> it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces could converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

5|$|Diamante and Rush {{ended the}} tournament on November 28, 2012 with just four points after {{victories}} over Tencozy and Masato Tanaka and Yujiro Takahashi, finishing in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>place</b> in Group B, after losses to the teams of Toru Yano and Takashi Iizuka, K.E.S. (Lance Archer and Davey Boy Smith, Jr.), Manabu Nakanishi and Strongman and finally Shelton Benjamin and MVP. Diamante Azul and Rush finished their tour with a pay-per-view show on December 2, losing to Jado and Yoshi-Hashi in a tag team match, with Diamante Azul once again {{being the one}} pinned for the win. Diamante Azul teamed up with Rudo Euforia for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles ("National Incredible Pairs Tournament") where the concept was that rivals would team up for a tag team tournament. The team would defeat Ángel de Oro and Ephesto {{in the first round}} of the tournament, but lost to Atlantis and Último Guerrero in the second round. On June 4, Diamante Azul defeated Rey Bucanero to win the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1244–1245, as-Salih Ayyub {{had seized}} the area {{approximate}} to the modern-day West Bank from an-Nasir Dawud; he gained possession of Jerusalem, then marched on to take Damascus, which fell with relative ease in October 1245. Shortly afterward, Sayf al-Din Ali surrendered his exposed principality of Ajlun and its fortress to as-Salih Ayyub. The rupture {{of the alliance}} between the Khwarizmids and as-Salih Ayyub ended with the virtual destruction of the former by al-Mansur Ibrahim, the Ayyubid emir of Homs, in October 1246. With the Khwarizimid defeat, as-Salih Ayyub was able to complete the conquest of southern Syria. His general Fakhr ad-Din went on to subdue an-Nasir Dawud's territories. He sacked the lower town of Karak, then besieged its fortress. A stalemate followed with neither an-Nasir Dawud or Fakhr ad-Din strong enough to dislodge the other's forces. A settlement was eventually reached whereby an-Nasir Dawud would retain the fortress, but cede {{the remainder of his}} principality to as-Salih Ayyub. Having settled the situation in Palestine and Transjordan, Fakhr ad-Din moved north and marched to Bosra, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>place</b> still held by Ismail. During the siege, Fakhr ad-Din fell ill, but his commanders continued the assault against the city, which fell in December 1246.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>place</b> anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{possibility}} that romantic attachment after the death of a partner continues as a form of symbolic attachment in older adults. Symbolic attachment was measured by means of the former attachment to the deceased spouse, the frequency of visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> and <b>the</b> emotions experienced at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place.</b> Additionally <b>the</b> motives for visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> were investigated. Method: The research group of 40 Dutch participants age 65 and older, who lost their life time partner and who were able to visit <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> completed <b>the</b> Dutch translation of the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire revised (ECR-R) and the Dutch Depression Adjective Checklist (VROPSOM). To explore the motives for visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> a new questionnaire was developed. This ‘Motieven voor het Bezoeken van de Laatste Rustplaats’ (MBLR) questionnaire was also filled out by the participants. Results: Results for visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> showed that there was a marginally significant positive relationship with anxious attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment was marginally negatively related to visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> and there was no relationship between avoidant attachment and visiting. Opposite to what was expected, this study did not show a relationship between attachment to the deceased partner and emotions experienced while visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place.</b> <b>The</b> most frequently reported motives for visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place</b> were maintaining the emotional bond and inspecting the site. Conclusion: There seems to be some relationship between attachment style to the deceased partner and frequency of visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place.</b> No evidence has been found that attachment to the deceased partner influences the emotions one experiences while visiting <b>the</b> <b>last</b> resting <b>place.</b> Further research is needed to explore if romantic attachment after the death of a partner actually continues as a form of symbolic attachment in older adults...|$|R

5|$|Then 38-year-old {{sharpshooter}} Roger Daniel, {{a two-time}} Olympian (participating in the men's air pistol 10meters and the men's free pistol 50meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens) and {{participant in the}} Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, represented Trinidad and Tobago as its only shooter in Beijing by {{taking part in the}} men's air pistol 10meters. In the first round, Daniel scored 98 points; in the second round, 95; in the third, 92; in the fourth, 94; in the fifth, 96; and the sixth and final, 96. Daniel tied four other athletes for the third greatest number of points in the first round, and received least number of points in the third round of any participating athlete. Overall, during the August 9 course of events, Daniel earned 571points, ranking 37th out of the 49 participating athletes.
