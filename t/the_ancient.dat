Although technologically superior, <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> were a passive people by nature, and lacked the {{familiarity}} with aggression and strategic thinking to successfully neutralize the Wraith. This naïveté allowed the Wraith to lure Ancient warships into unprotected areas of space where they were ambushed and captured, along with their ZPM power supplies, which the Wraith used to power cloning facilities that increased the size of their army a hundredfold. Vastly outnumbered, <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> sent a delegation protected by their most powerful warships to sue for peace, but they were wiped out.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> are actually <b>the</b> [...] "first evolution" [...] of humanity, originating in a distant galaxy from the Milky Way. At {{some point in their}} races history, an ideological schism occurred between two factions who later became known as <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> and [...] "Ori", the former advocating the values of science and reason, while the latter championed religious devotion, respectively. This schism resulted from <b>the</b> threat <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> felt from <b>the</b> Ori's religious zeal, prompting a mass exodus by <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> from their home world via a large ship. After a presumably long voyage <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> arrived in <b>the</b> Milky Way galaxy where they colonized a number of planets, notably Earth. After tens of millions of years they emigrated to the Pegasus galaxy to survive, having seeded life in the Milky Way before they left.

50|$|The Wraith, over a vast period, {{developed}} into an advanced but violent society (with vestiges of territorialism that were later harshly revived when their prey became scarce) - {{all the while}} avoiding the attention of <b>the</b> <b>Ancients.</b> When <b>the</b> sentient Wraith were discovered by <b>the</b> <b>Ancients,</b> it appears their ferocity, belligerence and large population were underestimated. <b>The</b> <b>Ancients</b> sent a delegation protected by their most powerful warships {{to negotiate with the}} Wraith, but the ships were ambushed and destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>Ancients</b> and Wraith went to war, and despite the Ancients' technological superiority, the Wraith overwhelmed <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> with their sheer numbers.

5000|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, the first {{evolution}} of humanity {{known as the}} Alterans (from Latin alteri, [...] "the others", though in canon, it descends from <b>the</b> <b>Ancient's</b> own language), lived in a distant unknown galaxy while proceeding along the evolutionary path to ascension. At the time, those who were later {{to be known as}} the Ori and <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> were not distinguished from each other, and lived in one society. However, a philosophical division emerged. Over time, the Ori grew more and more fervent in their religious belief, while <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> adopted a more scientific outlook. Ultimately, their viewpoints diverged so much that the two groups split apart and began to oppose each other, culminating in the Ori attempting to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Ancients.</b> Instead of going to war, <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> decided to leave their galaxy, and began searching for a new home. The Ori later used their departure to their advantage, including their departure in the Book of Origin, claiming that <b>the</b> mountain <b>the</b> <b>Ancients</b> leveled while leaving contained evil and that it was buried as the mountain collapsed.|$|R

Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One after Kaecilius reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One and escapes to Hong Kong.

Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
