50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Klingon ships seen in the Star Trek franchise. Introduced in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey has {{featured}} in five of the films and frequently appears in The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Industrial Light & Magic designed and built <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey for Star Trek III, assisted by the film's director, Leonard Nimoy. In early drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script, <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey was to be a Romulan vessel; although this idea was later dropped, <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey maintained its cloaking device as a plot point in the film and <b>the</b> Romulan <b>bird</b> feather patterns on its wings were kept. <b>The</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey is <b>the</b> first Klingon vessel depicted with a cloaking device; all classes chronologically later in the series would also use a cloaking device. <b>The</b> wings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey are able to move, lowering to attack, maintaining just above horizontal in flight mode and raising high when the ship lands. However, as the studio model's mechanism for moving the wings broke, in later Star Trek series' episodes the wings are usually fixed in either flight mode or attack mode. This was not rectified until the creation of a CGI model for the vessel. The studio models for <b>the</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> Prey were sold in the 2006 Christie's auction; the original model sold for US$307,200, while an enlarged wing, used for close-up shots in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, was sold for US$8,400.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> the World. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After Cassandra Cain {{abandoned}} the role a mystery character appeared {{as the new}} Batgirl in <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Prey comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen claimed the empty mantle {{in an attempt to}} honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role.

5|$|In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen {{granted the}} taxon {{autonomous}} status in her book, Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis. The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. Collar and John D. Pilgrim in 2007, and {{endorsed by the}} International Ornithological Congress, by Alan P.

5|$|In March 2016, DC Comics {{announced}} it would be relaunching all of its monthly titles under the DC Rebirth event. The relaunch restores elements of the pre-Flashpoint DC continuity while maintaining elements of The New 52 as well. Among the new titles and creative teams announced, volume five of Batgirl written by Hope Larson and volume one of Batgirl and <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Prey written by Julie Benson and Shawna Benson were included. In volume five of Batgirl, Barbara Gordon is a student attending Burnside College in the trendy Burnside neighborhood of Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe. There are more than 20 subspecies, but the precise number depends on how small differences between populations are evaluated. This article follows the 2013 Handbook of <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> the World Alive treatment, which has more recognised forms than the 1996 Tits, Nuthatches and Treecreepers. Given the similarities between geographical forms of the Eurasian nuthatch, subspecies boundaries are somewhat fluid, although fewer than half as many are recognised now as in 1967.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> Thailand {{are mainly}} {{typical of the}} Indomalaya ecozone, with affinities to the Indian subcontinent to the west, and, {{particularly}} in Southern Thailand, with the Sundaic fauna to the southeast.

5|$|The striped honeyeater {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist and bird artist, John Gould, in A Synopsis of <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Australia and the Adjacent Islands, published in 1838. It {{is a member}} of the family Meliphagidae, the honeyeaters, and the sole member of the monotypic genus Plectorhyncha. Molecular studies indicate that genus is closely allied to the monotypic genus Grantiella, though dissimilar in appearance. The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) and the striped honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also Philemon and Xanthotis.|$|E
5|$|Two of the {{subspecies}} {{listed above}} (Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides and F. p. babylonicus) are often instead treated {{together as a}} distinct species, Falco pelegrinoides (the Barbary falcon), although they were included within F. peregrinus in the 1994 Handbook of <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> the World. These birds inhabit arid regions from the Canary Islands along {{the rim of the}} Sahara through the Middle East to Central Asia and Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{one-shot}}, {{the events}} of The Killing Joke were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Prey series, {{she was in a}} wheelchair and became the computer hacker Oracle (this series was later adapted into a TV series of the same title). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, , involving the Joker murdering Robin (Jason Todd), The Killing Joke, leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later, Stephanie Brown. Gordon's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three yearsin DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, The New 52, which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl.|$|E

5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{described}} the grey jay as Corvus canadensis in the 12th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae in 1766. William John Swainson named it Dysornithia brachyrhncha in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the grey jay to the genus Perisoreus in 1838 in A geographical and comparative list of <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> Europe and North America, along with the Siberian jay, P. infaustus. The grey jay belongs to the crow and jay family Corvidae. However, it {{and the other members}} of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus Cyanopica, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the grey jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.|$|E
5|$|English ornithologist John Latham {{described}} the boobook owl as Strix boobook in 1801, taking its species epithet {{from a local}} Aboriginal word for the bird. John Gould described Athene marmorata in 1846 from a specimen in South Australia; this is now regarded as a synonym. German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup classified the two taxa into subgenus Spiloglaux of a new genus Ieraglaux in 1852, renaming S. boobook to Ieraglaux (Spiloglaux) bubuk. In his 1865 Handbook to <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Australia, Gould recognised three species, all of which he placed in the genus Spiloglaux: S. marmoratus from South Australia, S. boobook, which is widespread across the continent and Tasmania, and S. maculatus from southeastern Australia and Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Rasmussen {{took the}} {{position}} of assistant to S. Dillon Ripley, {{the former secretary of}} the Smithsonian, who was planning to produce a definitive guide to <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> South Asia. When he became ill shortly after beginning the project, Rasmussen took over the project, and with artist John C. Anderton, produced , a two-volume bird guide for the Indian subcontinent which was the first field guide for the area to include sonograms. Volume 1 contains the field guide with over 3400 illustrations in 180 plates, and more than 1450 colour maps. Volume 2 (Attributes and Status) gives specimen measurements, data about identification, status, distribution and habits. Vocalizations are described from recordings, and there are over 1000 sonagrams.|$|E

5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds of Prey {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but is engaged by <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Prey. Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two Birds of Prey, while Enterprise impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{birds have}} {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of America are among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume <b>The</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under <b>the</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character {{has been the subject}} of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.|$|E
