'La nécessité de mentir pour désavouer un ouvrage est une extrémité qui répugne également à la conscience et à la noblesse du caractère; mais le crime est pour les hommes injustes qui rendent ce désaveu nécessaire à la sûreté de celui qu'ils y forcent. Si vous avez érigé en crime ce qui n'en est pas un, si vous avez porté atteinte, par des lois absurdes ou par des lois arbitraires, au droit naturel qu'ont tous les hommes, non seulement d'avoir une opinion, mais de la rendre publique, alors vous méritez de perdre celui qu'a chaque homme d'entendre la vérité de la bouche d'un autre, droit qui fonde seul l'obligation rigoureuse de ne pas mentir. S'il n'est pas permis de <b>tromper,</b> c'est parceque <b>tromper</b> quelqu'un, c'est lui faire un tort, ou s'exposer à lui en faire un; mais le tort suppose un droit, et personne n'a celui de cherche, à s'assurer les moyens de commettre une injustice.' Vie de Voltaire; Œuv. iv. 33, 34. Condorcet might have found some countenance for his sophisms in Plato (Republ. ii. 383); but even Plato restricted the privilege of lying to statesmen (iii. 389). He was in a wiser mood when he declared (Œuv. v. 384) {{that it is better}} to be imprudent than a hypocrite,--though for that matter these are hardly the only alternatives.|$|E

From Maurus comes the Portuguese [...] "Moro," [...] and our [...] "Moor." [...] When Vasco de Gama reached Calicut, he found there a tribe of Arab colonists, who in religion and in language were the same as the people of Northern Africa,-for this reason he called them [...] "Moors." [...] This was explained long ago by Vincent (Periplus, lib. 3), and lately by Prichard (Natural History of Man). I repeat it because it has been my fate to hear, at a meeting of a learned society in London, a gentleman declare, that in Eastern Africa he found a people calling themselves Moors. Maghrabin-Westerns,-then would be opposed to Sharkiyin, Easterns, the origin of our [...] "Saracen." [...] From Gibbon downwards many have discussed the history of this word; but few expected in the nineteenth century to see a writer on Eastern subjects assert, with Sir John Mandeville, that these people [...] "properly, ben clept Sarrazins of Sarra." [...] The learned M. Jomard, who never takes such original views of things, asks a curious question:-"Mais comment un son aussi distinct que le Chine [Arabic text] aurait-il pu se confondre avec le Syn [Arabic text] et, pour un mot aussi connu que charq; comment aurait-on pu se <b>tromper</b> a l'omission des points?" [...] Simply because the word Saracens came to us through the Greeks (Ptolemy uses it), who have no such sound as sh in their language, and through the Italian which, hostile to the harsh sibilants of Oriental dialects, generally melts sh down into s. So the historical word Hashshashiyun-hemp-drinker,-civilised by the Italians into [...] "assassino," [...] became, as all know, an expression of European use.

[FN#6] The hands are raised in order to catch the blessing that is supposed to descend from heaven upon the devotee; and the meaning of drawing the palms down the face is symbolically to transfer the benediction to every part of the body. [FN#7] As is the case under all despotic governments, nothing can be more intentionally offensive than the official manners of a superior to his inferior in Egypt. The Indians charge their European fellow-subjects with insolence of demeanour and coarseness of language. As far as my experience goes, our roughness and brusquerie are mere politeness compared with what passes between Easterns. At the same time it must be owned that I have seen the worst of it. [FN#8] It was far safer and more expeditious in Al-Adrisi's day (A.D. 1154), when the captain used to sit on the poop [...] "furnished with numerous and useful instruments"; when he [...] "sounded the shallows, and by his knowledge of the depths could direct the helmsman where to steer."

It extends from Zafaran Point to Hammam Bluffs, ten miles of deep water. [FN#11] The Hebrew name of this part of the Red Sea. In a communication lately made to the Royal Geographical Society, I gave my reasons for believing that the Greeks borrowed their Erythraean Sea from the Arabic [...] "Sea of Himyar."

[FN#15] One of the numerous species of what the Italians generally call [...] "Pasta." [...] The material is wheaten or barley flour rolled into small round grains. In Barbary it is cooked by steaming, and served up with hard boiled eggs and mutton, sprinkled with red pepper. These Badawi Maghrabis merely boiled it. [FN#16] The Azan is differently pronounced, though similarly worded by every orthodox nation in Al-Islam. [FN#17] The usual way of kissing the knee is to place the finger tips upon it, and then to raise them to the mouth. It is an action denoting great humility, and the condescending superior who is not an immediate master returns the compliment in the same way. [FN#18] The Maghrabi dialect is known to be the harshest and most guttural form of Arabic. It owes this unenviable superiority to its frequency of [...] "Sukun," [...] or the quiescence of one or more consonants;-"K'lab," [...] for instance, for [...] "Kilab," [...] and [...] "'Msik" [...] for [...] "Amsik." [...] Thus it is that vowels, the soft and liquid part of language, disappear, leaving in their place a barbarous sounding mass of consonants. [FN#19] Burckhardt mentions the Arab legend that the spirits of the drowned Egyptians may be seen moving at the bottom of the sea, and Finati adds that they are ever busy recruiting their numbers with shipwrecked mariners. [FN#20] I thus called upon a celebrated Sufi or mystic, whom many East-Indian Moslems reverence as the Arabs do their Prophet. In Appendix I the curious reader will find Abd al-Kadir again mentioned. [FN#21] Those people are descendants of Syrians and Greeks that fled from Candia, Scios, the Ionian Islands, and Palestine to escape the persecutions of the Turks. They now wear the Arab dress, and speak the language of the country, but they are easily to be distinguished from the Moslems by the expression of their countenances and sometimes by their blue eyes and light hair. There are also a few families calling themselves Jabaliyah, or mountaineers. Originally they were 100 households, sent by Justinian to serve the convent of St. Catherine, and to defend it against the Berbers.	Sultan Kansuh al-Ghori, called by European writers Campson Gaury, the Mamluk King of Egypt, in A.D. 1501, admitted these people into the Moslem community on condition of their continuing the menial service they had afforded to the monks. [FN#22] Adam's forehead (says the Tarikh Tabari) brushed the skies, but this height being inconvenient, the Lord abridged it to 100 cubits. The Moslems firmly believe in Anakim. Josephus informs us that Moses was of [...] "divine form and great tallness"; the Arabs specify his stature,-300 cubits. They have, moreover, found his grave in some parts of the country S.E, of the Dead Sea, and make cups of a kind of bitumen called [...] "Moses' Stones." [...] This people nescit ignorare-it will know everything. [FN#23] [...] "Moses' Well." [...] I have no argument except the untrustworthy traditions of the Badawin, either for or against this having been the identical well near which Moses sat when he fled from the face of Pharaoh to the land of Midian. One thing is certain, namely, that in this part of Arabia, as also at Aden, the wells are of a very ancient date.|$|E

50|$|This {{version of}} the story was an {{influence}} on the fable's retelling in Europe. It is to be found early among the humorous tales of Poggio Bracciolini's Facetiae (1450), where the fleeing fox explains only that the dogs have not yet heard that peace has been declared. In France the story reappeared in the first book of emblems of Guillaume Gueroult (1550). There the fable is told at length and it is explained that the suspicious cock has invented his report of the approaching hounds because he distrusts the fox. The telling is prefaced with the summary of the fable’s meaning: “To the trickster comes a trickster and a half” (A trompeur, trompeur et demi). When Jean de la Fontaine retold the story as Le coq et le renard (II.15), he underlined his use of Geroult by concluding with a moral that echoed his source: “Pleasure is doubled in tricking the trickster” (c’est double plaisir de <b>tromper</b> le trompeur).|$|E

The Schmale Heide separates the outer bay of Prorer Wiek from the lagoon of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden. On the peninsula of Jasmund are the Piekberg (...) , the highest point on Rügen, and the Königsstuhl, a 118-metre-high chalk cliff in Stubbenkammer, which forms the most striking landmark on the island. Another bar, the Schaabe, links Jasmund to the peninsula of Wittow in the north of Rügen. The Schaabe, in turn, separates the outer bay of <b>Tromper</b> Wiek from the lagoon of the Großer Jasmunder Bodden. The peninsula of Wittow and the long, narrow peninsula of Bug to the west are separated from the main body of Rügen by the Rassower Strom, the Breetzer Bodden and the Breeger Bodden.

There are no {{indications}} that {{he returned to the}} Low Countries until the year of 1574, when he paid a brief visit to the Dutch towns of Hoorn and Haarlem. It is believed that De Hooghe was involved in the release of Lieven van Weldam (his distant cousin), who was taken prisoner during the Battle of the Zuiderzee (1573) and kept in captivity in this town. During the negotiations with the local authorities he presented himself as a “trader” from the English coastal town of Ipswich. His mission was successful and Van Weldam was released in exchange for the Haarlem mayor Kies. Right after the exchange had taken place, De Hooghe received an invitation by the Haarlem magistrate for a map of Haarlem to be made, which he refused, because of the low price.He then returned to Ipswich, where he worked as a trader again. Some records of shiploads and a few court cases of ill-handed transports of goods proof that he had his own trading company. It is not known when exactly he became involved in making the first atlas of England and Wales, also known by the names of [...] "Elisabeth Atlas" [...] and [...] "Saxton Atlas" [...] (Christophorus Saxtonius, Descriptio Angliae 1579), for which he incised the first map of Norfolk, “Norfolciae comitatus...” in the year 1574.

40|$|In the <b>Tromper</b> Wiek {{northeast}} of Rügen, acoustical investigations using Air Gun, Boomer, Chirp Sonar and Sediment-Echosounder were carried out. Together with sediment core information, it allowed {{the identification of}} five seismostratigraphic units (E 1 to E 5). Conventional and AMS- 14 C-datings supported their chronostratigraphical classification. The uppermost till (E 1) was incised by late glacial channels filled with glaciolacustrine sediments (E 2) of the early Baltic Ice Lake stages. These were regionally overlain with a sharp unconformity by a thick (locally > 20 m) sedimentary complex (E 3) of acoustically laminated silts of freshwater origin. This {{lower part of the}} E 3 -complex (E 3 a) is overlain by fluvial to coastal silty fine sands (E 3 b) deeper towards the Arkona Basin. Fine plant debris in the uppermost part of sub-unit E 3 a yielded ages of 10, 100 and 10, 500 14 C-years B. P., representing the final phase of the Baltic Ice Lake. The fine sands of sub-unit E 3 b were deposited after the final drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. In the shallower central part of the bay, the silts of sub-unit E 3 a were covered by a younger unit (E 4) of fine sand with plant debris. A sedge peat occurring at the basis of unit E 4 yielded an age of 9, 590 14 C-years B. P. The fine sands overlying the unit E 3 in the central part of <b>Tromper</b> Wiek were deposited in the Ancylus Lake. Their position at about 20 m below present sea level (b. s. l.) reflects the maximum highstand in this area. The character and distribution of the Early Holocene deposits at greater depth suggest a lake water level at about 30 m b. s. l. after this highstand. Below 25 m b. s. l. muddy Littorina Sea sediments are observed. The thickness of these muds and sandy muds increases gradually towards the Arkona Basin.

Geochemical and mineralogical {{analyses of the}} fluff show regional differences (trends) in composition, attributed to provenance and to hydrographical conditions along their transport pathways. Temporal variability is very high at the shallow water station of the estuary, and decreases towards the deeper stations in the north. In the shallow water area, intensive resuspension of the fluff due to wind-driven waves and currents leads to an average residence time of only one to two days. Near-bottom lateral transport of the fluff is the main process that transfers the fine grained material, containing both nutrients and contaminants, from the coastal zone into the deeper basins of the Baltic Sea. Seasonal effects (e. g. biogenic production in relation to trace metal variation) are observed at the <b>Tromper</b> Wiek station, where the residence time of the fluffy material is in the scale of seasons.

40|$|ABSTRACT Gravel pits {{created by}} anchor hopper {{dredging}} may affect regional sediment transport patterns by trapping sediments. In turn, this may cause -or enhance- erosion at the adjacent coastline. Reliable assessment of such impacts requires {{a good understanding}} of the hydro-sediment dynamic processes acting at dredged pits. This paper examines the processes for sand re-suspension from pressure, current and turbidity data collected inside and outside a single dredged pit, in a non-tidal environment (<b>Tromper</b> Wiek, Baltic Sea). The data confirm the generally weak sediment dynamics in the area, with waves being the main hydrodynamic agent for sediment re-mobilization. Comparisons with historical data indicate a small number of sediment re-suspension events (< 15 %), over a 37 months-long period, without significant difference inside and outside the pit. Suspended sediment concentration profiles are predicted inside the studied pit by a simplistic model, tuned to over-estimate sediment re-suspension. The results suggest that the depth of the excavation should be very shallow (< 1 m) for the bed material to be frequently extracted out by waves, and redistributed over the area. With pits up to 7 m-deep within the extraction zone, we conclude that a significant fraction of sediment is trapped over the long-term period (years) ...|$|E
40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in deutscher Sprache hinterlegt.) Two {{differently}} exposed research areas (Graal-Müritz and <b>Tromper</b> Wiek), {{which are}} typical for the south-western Baltic Sea coast were investigated {{in order to}} assess the recent sediment dynamics and the processes and time scales of the regeneration of aggregate extraction sites. For both field sites, the extension of the upper and lower shoreface was evaluated from hydrodynamical and sedimentological data. Repeated sidecan sonar surveys and sedimentological investigations show a very low variability of sediment distribution patterns and grain size distributions on the lower shoreface of both research areas at seasonal time-scales. The proccesses of re-filling of 3 extraction sites, differing in respect to water depth, extraction method and extracted material were identified. Time scales of regeneration were assessed for those sites. Differences in the velocity of regeneration {{can be explained by the}} position of the extraction sites relative to the seaward limit of the shoreface, the character and availability of the potential material for regeneration and the depth of the extraction. The fundamental problem is, that aggregate extraction seaward of the shoreface implies long time spans of regeneration, while extractions on the shoreface can be re-generated quite fast; nevertheless, there is a potential of negative effects on the sediment budget. As a consequence, there is no "ideal" location for marine sediment extraction. The appropriate place for extraction should be a well-balanced compromise allowing relatively fast regeneration together with a minimized impact on the coastal sediment budget. In order to fulfill those requirements detailed knowledge about sediment budgets, availability and dynamics in the considered area is neccessary...|$|E
30|$|During recent years, many Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) {{have shown}} {{expanding}} rings around {{the sources of}} the images. These rings were confirmed to be photons scattered by the concentrated dust grains. Some observations even showed that more than one ring existed near the sources, which indicated that there was more than one dust concentration along the line of sight (LOS) of a GRB (Vaughan et al., 2004; Tiengo et al., 2010). There are mainly two different ways to study the X-ray halos. The first is the delay property of the scattered photons. Because scattered photons travel through longer paths than unscattered photons, they must lag those unscattered photons. The length of the lag is related to both the location where the scattering takes place and the distance of the source. The exact scattering cross-section and the dust-grain properties are not important in this method. <b>Trömper</b> and Schönfelder (1973) and Hu et al. (2004) have also proposed to use the smeared property of the light curves to study the scattered halo. Because of the bad statistics in the data of the actual observations, these methods have not been tested so far. The other method is the halo-brightness distribution. Nearly all X-ray scattered halos are found by comparing the observed radial surface brightness with the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope used. The total fraction of the scattered X-ray photons can be derived by this method precisely. In summary, because the scattering process is related to the properties of the dust grains, i.e. the space distribution, the chemical composition, and the radii of the dust grains, we can study those properties with the X-ray scattered halos.|$|E

Boomer data, acquired in October 2004, permitted to improve the knowledge of the late Quaternary geological evolution of <b>Tromper</b> Wiek, a semienclosed bay, located in the north-eastern part of Rügen Island. The sedimentary deposits can be subdivided in 6 seismic units (U 1 to U 6). The upper part of the lowest unit (U 1) corresponds to Pleistocene till. Channels incise the top of this till (surface S 2), probably created during the first drainage of the Baltic Sea during the Late Glacial. Subsequent channel filling (U 2) occurred in two phases beginning with chaotic deposits, probably fluviatile of origin, followed by graded deposits. This filling was stopped by an erosive period with the formation of surface S 3, showing channels at the same location as S 2. The facies of the channel filling (U 3 and U 4), during a second phase, is similar to the first one, but resembles a prograding sediment body, intercalated between the two units in the shallower part. U 3 shows a bar-shaped deposit at its top. The facies of U 4 is very similar to a barrier/back-barrier facies similar to the facies of unit U 5, partly composed of gravel. The deposits of U 6 correspond to the post-Littorina Sea deposits. The presence of gravel is linked to coastal cliffs, in which chalk layers, pushed up by glaciers, alternate with sections of till and meltwater deposits and with submarine outcrops of till. Gravel deposits are present in unit U 5. They are strongly linked to the presence of a barrier. Four of the six units show a barrier facies (U 2, U 3, U 4 and U 5); gravel deposits could be present inside all of these units and would represent a larger deposit than estimated previously...|$|E
