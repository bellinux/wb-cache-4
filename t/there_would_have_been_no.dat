5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> room for such soft tissue.|$|E

Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

25|$|On the {{argument}} that verses of Ali’s rule had been removed, Al-Khoei states that {{the collection of the}} Quran by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman occurred significantly after the caliphate was decided and so if Ali’s rule had been mentioned {{it would have been the}} strongest argument for him to be the first caliph. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone.

He claims that if it were his work, the Zohar would have been mentioned by the Talmud, as has been the case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had bar Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of bar Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah was a revealed doctrine, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.|$|E
25|$|The {{preliminary}} draft plan of 1992 envisaged speeds of 250km/h with a journey time between Nuremberg and Erfurt of 75minutes. The planned costs were DM 8 billion (about €4 billion). Already in 1993, {{before the beginning}} of construction, the route handled 80passenger trains during the day and 200freight trains at night. In 1992, five options were developed that would have passed through a 20kilometre-wide corridor, one of which was immediately rejected. A route through Coburg that would have required the demolition of existing buildings was also considered. At first the use of the existing line south of Coburg with a new line commencing on its southern approach had been considered as the favoured option. The Thuringian Forest would have been crossed at its narrowest point, but <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> stop in Coburg.

25|$|Casey {{could have}} {{commissioned}} the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Billy McMahon, as acting Prime Minister or Caretaker prime minister, {{but instead he}} appointed John McEwen, the leader of Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party. In this he was following a precedent set in 1939, when Sir Earle Page was appointed Prime Minister {{following the death of}} Joseph Lyons. But it was later alleged that Casey appointed McEwen to prevent McMahon having an advantage in the Liberal Party's ballot for a new leader, since he shared the view of some Liberals that McMahon would not be a suitable successor. This matter was aired in a 1969 book, The Power Struggle, by veteran political journalist Alan Reid. Casey's biographer, W.J. Hudson says (in his 1986 book Casey) that Casey was concerned to preserve the Liberal-Country Party coalition, and that he knew (because McEwen had told him) that the Country Party would not serve under McMahon. (McEwen publicly confirmed his party's position on McMahon the day after his swearing-in.) If this was his motive for commissioning McEwen rather than McMahon, it suggests that he did take political considerations into account in making his decision. On the other hand, if the coalition were to disband, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> party that could command a majority in the parliament and it could well have become unworkable.|$|E

McMahon told Churchill in 1952 that [...] "If we had seen this Agreement, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> McMahon Act." [...] The McMahon Act fueled resentment from British scientists and Churchill, and led to Britain developing its own nuclear weapons.|$|E

He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism. He elaborated the physical doctrines of the Stoics and their theory of knowledge and he created much of their formal logic. In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what it was. It was said that [...] "without Chrysippus, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> Stoa".|$|E

He struggled in landing and on another occasion just four days later, his tyre burst on landing approach. The Moth bounced up into the air and Finucane barely recovered to make a heavy landing, although this time he was praised by his instructor.

500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Cosima's death, some writers heaped copious praise on her. Ernest Newman, Wagner's biographer, called her [...] "the greatest figure that ever came within [...] circle"; Richard du Moulin Eckart, Cosima's first biographer, introduced her as [...] "the greatest woman of the century". In time judgements became more measured, and divided. Marek closes his account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner's protector but as his muse: [...] "Without her <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> Siegfried Idyll, no Bayreuth, and no Parsifal". In Hensher's judgement, [...] "Wagner was a genius, but also a fairly appalling human being. Cosima was just an appalling human being."
