Electodeposition of Co–Mo alloy from <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> bath is described.

Compared with conventional route using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer, the method has advantages of simple technology process, 100 % raw materials utilization ratio and totally zero emission during mass production；while {{the raw materials}} utilization ratio was only 22. 8 % and 48. 6 % for using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer under the same conditions. Furthermore, the proposed green route to production of <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> will save at least 813. 3 kJ and 948. 4 kJ of energy for manufacturing each kilogram of product than using NH 4 HCO 3 and NH 3 ·H 2 O (25 %) as neutralizer, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic voltammetric {{studies were}} carried out on {{platinum}} in alkaline solution containing cobalt sulphate, sodium tungstate, dimethyl sulphoxide and <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Spectral u. v. absorption studies of cobalt citrate complex indicate the species to be [Co L (H 2 O) 3] 2, where L is <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> The deposition of cobalt involves a stepwise electron transfer mechanism. The observed cyclic voltammetric data show that the alloy deposition is possibly from cobalt±tungstate complex. The citrate ions and dimethyl sulphoxide hinder the alloy deposition. Dimethyl sulphoxide, which specifically adsorbs on the electrode surface, favours the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas tungstate hinders the HER. Stripping voltammograms show the existence of cobalt rich alloy phases. X-ray diffraction studies further confirm the phases to be Co 3 W and Co 7 W...|$|E

The deposition of iron was found to involve the formation of FeOH+ and the second electron transfer is slow. The formation of iron nickel alloy film is anomalous. The charge transfer rates of FeOH+ and NiOH+ determine the deposition.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{precursor}} effects of citric acid and various citrates-including triethyl citrate, tripotassium citrate, trisodium citrate and triammonium citrate-on the formation of ZnO crystals in alkaline solution. These citrate-related chemicals could be divided into three groups (group A, triethyl citrate; group B, tripotassium citrate and trisodium citrate; and group C, citric acid and <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate)</b> based on their activity for modifying the ZnO growth direction and solution pH dependency on their concentration. We could obtain ZnO structures with various distinct morphologies by simply changing the concentration of citric acid or citrate additive dissolved in the alkaline reaction solution.

40|$|Thin {{films of}} Ni-Fe alloys of various {{compositions}} have been deposited potentiostatically from an alkaline sulfate bath solution containing the {{sodium salt of}} ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and <b>triammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (TAC). The complex nature of the bath solution was analyzed by cyclic potentiometric and spectrophotometric studies. The composition of the alloy was found to vary with the plating bath composition (Ni/Fe), plating potential and the concentration of complexing agent (EDTA). XRD studies showed that alloys are solid solutions of Fe in Ni (Î³-Phase) with fcc structure, free from oxides/hydroxides and pore free. The surface analysis by SEM revealed the nucleation by crystallites giving smooth deposit. The magnetic properties (Hc, Ms and squareness ratio) were evaluated from the parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular hysteresis loops.

40|$|Bacteriocins from {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} are ribosomal synthesized antibacterial proteins/ peptides having wide range of applications. Lactobacillus pentosus SJ 65, isolated from fermented Uttapam batter (used to prepare south Indian pan cake), produces bacteriocin having {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against pathogens. Optimization studies are of utmost important to understand the source of utilization and the conditions to enhance the production of metabolites. In the present study, an attempt was made to identify the parameters involved for maximal production of antimicrobial compounds especially bacteriocin from the isolate L. pentosus SJ 65. Initially, optimal conditions, such as incubation period, pH, and temperature were evaluated. Initial screening was done using methodology onevariable-at-a-time (OVAT) for various carbon and nitrogen sources.

40|$|Objective: Kefiran {{is one of}} the {{important}} microbial polysaccharides of many pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. It shows many potential medical applications as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory compound. The present work focuses on medium optimization for kefiran production using the standard strain Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens in submerged cultivation system. Methods: Different types and concentrations of key nutrients such as carbon sources (glucose, mannitol, sucrose, lactose), nitrogen sources (yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, casein hydrolysate) and inorganic phosphate were evaluated to select the most appropriate nutrients and concentrations for kefiran production. Growth curve kinetics were also carried out to compare between the kinetics of cell growth and kefiran production in medium before and after optimization. Results: It was clearly observed that type and concentration of carbon and nitrogen sources showed the significant effect on kefiran production. On the other hand, phosphate showed less effect on this process. The maximal kefiran production of about 1. 25 g/l was obtained in medium composed of (g/l) : lactose, 50. 0; yeast extract, 12. 0; KH 2 PO 4, 0. 25; sodium acetate, 5. 0; <b>Triammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> 2. 0; MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O, 0. 2; MnSO 4. 5 H 2 O, 0. 05.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made in {{preparing}} BiFeO 3 articles based on gel casting system. For this purpose, BiFeO 3 was synthesized by glycine-nitrate auto combustion route. The powders were calcined between 450 - 550 oC with different soaking time. Phase pure BiFeO 3 was obtained at 550 oC with a soaking time of 2 hours. Phase purity was authenticated by X- ray diffraction technique. Employing BET 5 point method, surface area was measured. The surface area calculated is about 10. 36 m 2 /g which is suitable for powder dispersion in gel casting system. Then the phase pure powder was used in gelcasting based on Acrylamide (AM) - N,N/-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAM) premix solution. First, the ratio of AM-MBAM was optimized. Then, stable dispersion of BiFeO 3 in that premix solution was also achieved with <b>Triammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (TAC) as dispersing agent with pH ~ 9. Then the slurry was gelcasted in humid atmosphere between 50 - 60 oC. The gelcasted bodies have good green strength and free of surface exfoliation defect. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to study the thermal behavior of green bodies. Gelcasted bodies were first machined in green state and sintered at different temperature between 750 - 825 oC to obtain the final product. The density of gelcasted body was measured and phases are again identified using X-ray diffraction. It has been observed that with increase in sintering temperature from 750 to 800 oC theoretical density increased from 92. 5 % to 94 %. A small amount of impurity was also present in sintered product...|$|E
