500|$|Chief lyric writer Rhys {{has stated}} that, whereas he might [...] "empty parts of [...] {{emotional}} state" [...] into some songs, Ice Hockey Hair's title track {{was written in}} the [...] "instant pop music" [...] tradition. The track was originally called [...] "Naff Gan" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "The Naff Song") as the band felt it [...] "had so many naff, cheesy things about it" [...] before being renamed [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] following a conversation with a Swedish football player who said that having 'ice hockey hair', an alternative name for the mullet hairstyle, was a really naff <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> his home country. Rhys has described the song as a [...] "Badfinger-style power ballad" [...] and claimed that it is about [...] "someone who's sunk so low they're asking advice off a woman with ice hockey hair". The track was recorded at Orinonco Studios, London.|$|E

500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's the easiest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I think that was a pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E

[...] "There's many examples in our history of things that may have not made short-term financial sense but was the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a philosophical or long-term sense", said Christopher Perille, Wrigley's senior director of corporate communications.|$|E

Cuomo called the move [...] "appropriate and prudent", and urged the executives of other banks to follow the firm's lead and refuse bonus payments.|$|E

Cosby is credited with helping to create the Black Stuntmen's Association in 1967. Producer Nonie Robinson claimed, [...] "We were the last project standing behind him" [...] but said that pulling him from the documentary was [...] "the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> light of the recent court deposition being made public". At the same time, The Black Stuntmen's Association removed a tribute to Cosby on its website.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, {{after the}} firm repaid the TARP {{investment}} from the U.S. Treasury, Goldman {{made some of}} the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance.

2500|$|RC {{approaches}} {{the issue of}} feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict [...] "no-socialising" [...] rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or sexual relationships with other co-counsellors unless these relationships pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors. [...] RC specifically rejects the label [...] "transference" [...] for this phenomenon, as this is {{seen as part of}} a [...] "symptomatic" [...] method typical in psychology; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and [...] "discharge" [...] about, such feelings. In addition, methods of [...] "getting attention out of distress" [...] are available which help with the difficulty of [...] "switching roles" [...] between counselor and client. When taught correctly, counselors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to [...] "socialise" [...] or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was also}} {{known to have}} been the {{decision}} maker in who was the head boss of the Mexican cartels. He justified these actions by saying in private meetings that [...] "he felt they could do their best in picking the better of the bad apples". These events, along {{with the fact that he}} was linked to personally overseeing who ran the heads of each Mexican cartel, together with the increasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (tesobono) investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9billion). The economically orthodox <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves. Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the Bank of Mexico decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.
