5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>experience,</b> including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>experience</b> in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} art, black {{subject matter}} {{has been used}} as raw material to portray <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>experience</b> and aesthetics. The way Blacks' facial features were once conveyed as stereotypical in media and entertainment continues to be an influence within art. Dichotomies arise from artworks such as Open Casket by Dana Schutz based on the murder of Emmett Till to remove the painting and destroy it from the way Black pain is conveyed. Meanwhile, Black artists such as Kerry James Marshall portrays the Black body as empowerment and Black invisibility.|$|E
25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>experience.</b> Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E

In 1966, {{he began}} studying medicine at the University of Natal, where he joined the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the apartheid system of racial segregation and white-minority rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white liberals, {{rather than by the}} blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that even when well-intentioned, white liberals failed to comprehend <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>experience</b> and often acted in a paternalistic manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure {{in the creation of the}} South African Students' Organisation (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to [...] "blacks", a term that Biko used in reference not just to Bantu-speaking Africans but also to Coloureds and Indians. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had various white friends and lovers. The National Party government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.|$|E

[...] Readers of the British music newspaper Melody Maker voted him the top vocalist of 1967, superseding Elvis Presley, who had topped the list for the prior 10 years. In 1988, he {{was inducted into the}} Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Five years later, the United States Post Office issued a 29-cent commemorative postage stamp in his honor.

[...] The Globe and Mails H. J. Kirchhoff considered it a [...] "riveting, thoughtful work" [...] that serves as a metaphor for American racism. Julien Roumette felt Romain's depiction of the racial tensions in America at the time was [...] "meticulously reconstituted, with a realistic, even documentary, rather exceptional dimension." [...] Julia Weldon of Harper's Magazine remarked with amusement that the events of the novel were ones that [...] "only a Frenchman" [...] could have found himself in. She felt the novel was a [...] "decathlon event" [...] in which Gary turned a [...] "household crisis into a full-scale allegory." [...] Overall, she praised the book as a [...] "memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white", noting she felt Gary had lived to [...] "witness his own maturity" [...] though she also wondered if he stretched the truth to [...] "make himself a legend in his own time." [...] It should be noted that all of these commentators are white and not in the least African-American nor have they lived <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

500|$|Sasha Frere-Jones, {{critic of}} The New Yorker praised the self made [...] "unpretentious, stuck {{together}} with Scotch tape" [...] style that M.I.A. achieves with her Roland MC-505 drum machine and keyboard unit, noting {{that many people}} had tried to copy the style since. [...] Her considerable influence on American hip hop music as an international artist is described by Adam Bradley and Andrew DuBois in The Anthology of Rap as making her an [...] "unlikely hip hop" [...] celebrity, given that the genre {{was one of several}} influences behind M.I.A.'s [...] "eccentric and energizing" [...] music and that the musician's unclassifiable sound was one example of how hip hop was changing as it came into contact with other cultures. Similarly, [...] Jeffrey H. Wallenfeldt writes in <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> <b>experience</b> in America : from civil rights to the present that no single artist may have personified hip hop in the 21st century better than M.I.A., in her [...] "politically radical lyrics drawing from widely diverse sources around the world". The Guardian critic Hattie Collins commented of M.I.A.'s influence, [...] "A new raver before it was old. A baile funk/pop pioneer before CSS and Bonde do Rolê emerged. A quirky female singer/rapper before the Mini Allens had worked out how to log on to MySpace. Missing In Action (or Acton, as she sometimes calls herself) has always been several miles ahead of the pack." [...] The twisting of western modalities in her music style using multilingual, multiethnic soundscapes to make electroclash-pop albums is noted by Derek Beres in Global beat fusion: the history of the future of music (2005) to defy world music categorisation. In the book Downloading Music (2007), Linda Aksomitis notes the various aspects of peer-to-peer file sharing of music in the rise in popularity of M.I.A., including {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the internet and platforms such as MySpace in the launch of her career. Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton highlight in Britpop and the English Music Tradition (2010) how M.I.A. alongside musicians such as Sway and Dizzee Rascal created music that explored new soundscapes with new technologies, with lyrics expressing anger at Britain's [...] "racialized subordination of minority groups" [...] and that the innovation that generates new musical forms like grime and dubstep are, inevitably, politically engaged. The chart success of grime-influenced artists like M.I.A. is heralded as a signal in the way that white Britons adapted to a new multicultural and plural musical mix in contrast to bands of the Britpop genre. Furthermore, her work being used as a global resource for the articulation of differently located themes and its connections to many music traditions is noted by Brian Longhurst in Popular music and society (2007) to illustrate such processes of interracial dialogue. Gary Shteyngart writing in GQ notes that [...] "M.I.A. is perhaps the preeminent global musical artist of the 2000s, a truly kick-ass singer and New York-Londony fashion icon, not to mention a vocal supporter of Sri Lanka's embattled Tamil minority, of which she's a member." ...|$|E
