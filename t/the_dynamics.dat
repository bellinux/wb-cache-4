40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a {{public key encryption}} scheme {{that is based on}} additive mixing of a message with chaotic nonlinear dynamics. A high-dimensional dissipative nonlinear dynamical system is distributed between transmitter and receiver. <b>The</b> transmitter <b>dynamics</b> is public (known to all) and <b>the</b> receiver <b>dynamics</b> is private (known only to the authorized receiver). Bidirectional signals that couple transmitter and receiver are transmitted over a public channel. Once <b>the</b> chaotic <b>dynamics</b> which is initialized with a random state converges to the attractor, a message is mixed with <b>the</b> chaotic <b>dynamics</b> at <b>the</b> transmitter. The authorized receiver who knows <b>the</b> entire <b>dynamics</b> can use a simple algorithm to decode the message. An unauthorized receiver does not know <b>the</b> receiver <b>dynamics</b> and needs to use computationally unfeasible algorithms in order to decode the message. Security is maintained by altering <b>the</b> private receiver <b>dynamics</b> during transmission. We show that using additive mixing modulation is more efficient than the attractor position modulation distributed dynamics encryption scheme. We demonstrate the concept of this new scheme by simulating a simple coupled map lattice. Index Terms—Chaos, nonlinear dynamics, public key encryption. I...|$|R
