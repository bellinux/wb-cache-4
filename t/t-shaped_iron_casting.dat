50|$|Brunel {{was known}} for his {{distrust}} of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as a material, at least for large beams. This distrust of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was vindicated when his friend Stephenson's adventurous cast-iron Dee Bridge (1846) collapsed in 1847. Brunel gave evidence in his support at the following inquiry, but this was on the basis of Stephenson being a competent engineer within the bounds of current knowledge, rather than in support of large cast-iron beams. Stephenson's Dee Bridge had used a truss girder, where an inverted <b>T-shaped</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> girder was trussed by applied wrought iron tension bars. This faulty design was instrumental in the bridge failure, where tension in the truss rods increased compression in {{the upper part of the}} girder such that it underwent columnar failure. Despite this, although with the advantage of hindsight, Brunel would use similar applied tension chains for his truss design.|$|R

In this study, effect of chill formation {{on the surface of}} grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is investigated on the wear behavior, hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> For this purpose, four types cam shaft made of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces, were casted. Mechanical tests were conducted after the camshafts have been produced by casting method. Surface hardness and wear resistance of grey and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> have been improved by chill formation on the surfaces and it is concluded that the amount of wear on the surfaces of grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with chill and nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with chill is almost the same.

50|$|Enameled <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{that has}} a {{vitreous}} enamel glaze. The enamel coating over the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> prevents rusting, eliminates the need to season the metal, and allows more thorough cleaning. Furthermore, pigments used in the enameling process can produce vibrant colors. While enamel-coated <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> doesn't have the seasoning and cleaning issues of bare <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> it can be several times more costly, and does not {{have some of the}} benefits of bare <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> such as the ability to withstand searing heat and resist sticking.

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{and mineral}} <b>cast</b> are the {{materials}} {{most often used}} in the machine structural elements design (bodies, housings, machine tools beds etc.). The materials significantly differ in physical and mechanical properties. The ability to suppress vibration {{is one of the}} most important factors determining the dynamic properties of the machine and has a significant impact on the machining capabilities of a machine tool. Recent research and development trends show that there is a clear tendency to move away from the traditional <b>iron</b> <b>casting</b> to the mineral casting, due to better dynamic properties of the latter. However mineral cast as a structural material for the whole machine tools bed turns out to be insufficient due to its poor mechanical strength properties. The best solution should benefit from the advantages of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and mineral <b>cast</b> materials while minimizing their drawbacks. The paper presents numerical modal analysis of two lathe beds: the first one made of gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and the second one made of hybrid connection of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and mineral <b>cast.</b> The analysis was conducted in order to determine the dynamic properties of two bodies of similar shapes made in the traditional (<b>cast</b> <b>iron)</b> and innovative hybrid (<b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and mineral <b>cast)</b> technology. In addition, an analysis of the static structure rigidity of the two beds was performed. During the simulation studies it was found a significant increase in dynamic stiffness and static rigidity of the machine tool body made of hybrid connection of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and mineral <b>cast.</b> The results of numerical simulations have confirmed the desirability of using hybrid construction because the dynamic properties of such a body are more advantageous in comparison with the conventional body made of <b>cast</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R
