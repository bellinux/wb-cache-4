5|$|Vanilla tahitensis (<b>Tahitian</b> vanilla), {{which is}} a cross-strain of Vanilla planifola (Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla) and Vanilla odorata (Inflated Vanilla), is {{produced}} in French Polynesia, especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher vanillin levels. <b>Tahitian</b> vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other <b>Tahitian</b> vanilla products include vanilla green tea, vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla rum, and vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla, {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the <b>Tahitian</b> Governor's garden in Papeete. A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as <b>Tahitian</b> vanilla. This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect to taste and scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the <b>Tahitian</b> variety.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Tahitian</b> Dog, {{known as}} the ʻŪrī Mā’ohi in the <b>Tahitian</b> language, was {{introduced}} to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the <b>Tahitian</b> (Mā’ohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were {{closely related to the}} Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurī; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands.|$|E

5|$|They were an {{essential}} part of traditional <b>Tahitian</b> society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi – a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget – which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their <b>Tahitian</b> counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Tahitian</b> {{traditional}} dance genre {{dating back}} to before the first contact with European explorers is ʻōteʻa, danced {{by a group of}} men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called tō‘ere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called fa‘atete, a single-headed hand drum called pahu tupa‘i rima, and a double-headed bass drum called tariparau.|$|E

The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E

5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two <b>Tahitian</b> Dogs {{aboard the}} ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having their legs opened with a lancet and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their remains is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of <b>Tahitian</b> women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E
5|$|The prelude of {{the novel}} begins with a 1982 letter from the elderly {{daughter}} of Rupert Brooke by a <b>Tahitian</b> women to Nell Golightly, asking Nell to help the daughter better understand her father.

Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the <b>Tahitian</b> Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness {{and intelligence}} {{of the people of}} Rurutu, as well as the success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the <b>Tahitian</b> port of Papeete - exceptionally high trade volumes in light of the relatively small size of the island and its population.|$|E
5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing {{an eclectic mix of}} <b>Tahitian,</b> Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E
60|$|Doubtless, in thus denationalizing the <b>Tahitians,</b> as it were, {{the missionaries}} were {{prompted}} by a sincere desire for good; but the effect has been lamentable. Supplied with no amusements in place of those forbidden, the <b>Tahitians,</b> who require more recreation than other people, have sunk into a listlessness, or indulge in sensualities, a hundred times more pernicious than all the games ever celebrated in the Temple of Tanee.|$|R
5000|$|The European ships however brought such {{diseases}} {{for which}} <b>Tahitians</b> {{had little or}} no immunity, such as dysentery, smallpox, scarlet fever, typhoid fever and tuberculosis. As a result of these changes by 1797 the population of Tahiti decreased to 16,000 from estimated 40,000 in 1767, when the first European ship HMS Dolphin touched on the island. [...] The 1881 census enumerated about 5,960 native <b>Tahitians.</b> The recovery continued in spite of a few more epidemics.|$|R

5|$|Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1916, this time built entirely upon copra export. Much of the South islet was deforested {{to make way for}} coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it was down to only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two <b>Tahitian</b> families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily <b>Tahitian</b> ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{protectorate}} status had {{a negative}} effect on the island's trade with Tahiti. Ships from Rurutu, as from other protectorates, were considered foreign vessels at the ports of France and its overseas territories such as the <b>Tahitian</b> port capital of Papeete, Rurutu's nearest significant trading partner. Consequently, Rurutu's agricultural exports were subject to tariffs from which the exports of annexed territories were exempted. The economic disadvantages of the protectorate status became even more evident when France closed the <b>Tahitian</b> ports to all foreigners in 1899, including merchants from Rurutu, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco. This disruption of trade between the two islands occurred in a period during which Rurutu became increasingly reliant economically on Tahiti. The growing prominence of Tahiti was evidenced in the activities of Teuruarii, who regularly visited Papeete for trade and entertainment. Teuruarii incurred much debt during these trips, and the need to pay off his creditors along with the restriction on trade prompted him to consider formal annexation to France.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with <b>Tahitian</b> and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|The Tahiti rail, <b>Tahitian</b> red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail (Gallirallus pacificus) is an {{extinct species}} of rail that lived on Tahiti. It was first {{recorded}} during James Cook's second voyage {{around the world}} (1772–1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. The Tahiti rail {{appears to have been}} closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the Tongan subspecies of that bird.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{arrived at}} Tubuai on 28 May 1789. The {{reception}} from the native population was hostile; when a flotilla of war canoes {{headed for the}} ship, Christian used a four-pounder gun to repel the attackers. At least a dozen warriors were killed, and the rest scattered. Undeterred, Christian and an armed party surveyed the island, and {{decided it would be}} suitable for their purposes. However, to create a permanent settlement, they needed compliant native labour and women. The most likely source for these was Tahiti, to which Bounty returned on 6 June. To ensure the co-operation of the Tahiti chiefs, Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh, and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Cook's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods and, on 16 June, the well-provisioned Bounty sailed back to Tubuai. On board were nearly 30 <b>Tahitian</b> men and women, some of whom were there by deception.|$|E
