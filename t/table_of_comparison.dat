40|$|Editor’s Summary: This chapter advocates the {{application}} of two educational methods, namely case studies and decision modeling, {{as the best way}} to teach design and management methods in power systems. A sample of case studies is presented, which includes public policy studies aimed at transmission and generation expansion subject to a cap on electricity prices and generation emissions. The second educational approach makes use of the structured decision modeling under multiple, conflicting performance measures; the objective is to seek a set of desirable and feasible solutions among numerous alternatives. As illustrative examples, the authors discuss several interesting case studies that deal with the selection of the right site and size of DG or of FACTS to mitigate instabilities in power systems. Furthermore, examples of simulation results are presented to illustrate the cost, spatial, and temporal relationship of the interconnection of the DG to the distribution feeders. A very comprehensive formulation of unit commitment is examined too. The chapter also includes the description of the working software package that the authors developed. Termed the Virginia Tech Electricity Grid and Market Simulator (VTEGMS), the main component of this package makes use of 2 object-oriented programming as a means to maximize the robustness and flexibility of the software.

The 1, 000, 000 electric rickshaws plying on the roads of {{the capital city of}} Delhi (Shukla, Dhar et al. 2014) have generated a revenue of nearly USD 40 million annually (assuming a monthly income of USD 330 per electric rickshaw). According to the Census of India, 2011, an average Indian household has a size of 4.9 (Nayak 2014) The average age of rickshaw pullers in Delhi is 27.5  years with most of them belonging to the age group of 19 to 40 (Kurosaki, Sawada.Y et al. 2007). In most of these households, the rickshaw puller is the sole bread winner; this highlights that each member now has access to USD 66 per month or USD 2.2 per day (considering equal income distribution per member) as opposed to USD 34 per month or USD 1.13 per day. The World Bank in 2015 put the poverty threshold at USD 1.9 a day; hence, nearly half a million lives are benefitted and have been empowered and marginally uplifted from poverty due to this technology intervention. Clearly highlighting technology empowerment can reduce human drudgery and mitigate poverty alleviation.

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 30 th anniversary of Innovation System research, this paper presents an extensive literature review on this large field of innovation research. Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities "system" and "innovation", the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparison</b> is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes...|$|E

40|$|Expanding {{upon the}} work of Way and Srivastava 2006 we {{demonstrate}} how the use of training sets of comparable size continue to make Gaussian process regression (GPR) a competitive approach to that of neural networks and other least-squares fitting methods. This is possible via new large size matrix inversion techniques developed for Gaussian processes (GPs) {{that do not require}} that the kernel matrix be sparse. This development, combined with a neural-network kernel function appears to give superior results for this problem. Our best fit results for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample using u,g,r,i,z filters gives an rms error of 0. 0201 while our results for the same filters in the luminous red galaxy sample yield 0. 0220. We also demonstrate that {{there appears to be a}} minimum number of training-set galaxies needed to obtain the optimal fit when using our GPR rank-reduction methods. We find that morphological information included with many photometric surveys appears, for the most part, to make the photometric redshift evaluation slightly worse rather than better. This would indicate that most morphological information simply adds noise from the GP point of view in the data used herein. In addition, we show that cross-match catalog results involving combinations of the Two Micron All Sky Survey, SDSS, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer have to be evaluated in the context of the resulting cross-match magnitude and redshift distribution. Otherwise one may be misled into overly optimistic conclusions.

40|$|It is now {{assumed that}} both {{speakers}} and signers use gestures in language interaction, as these units {{are an integral}} part of linguistic communication (Sweetser 2009). In order to compare spoken and signed communication, Vermeerbergen & Demey (2007) recommend confronting sign languages with speech in combination with gestures. It is also admitted that, in contrast with spoken languages (SpLs), sign languages (SLs) offer the unique property to grammaticalize both manual and nonmanual gestures (Herrmann & Steinbach 2013). This paper aims to foster the knowledge on these issues by studying the palm-up gesture in combination with nonmanuals (including, among others, facial displays, gaze, head moves, and shoulders’ moves), comparing their use in SpLs and SLs. The comparison will provide new insight into the hypothesized differences between grammaticalized (or, even pragmaticalized – Degand & Evers-Vermeul 2015) gestures and nonmanuals used in SLs, on the one hand, and co-speech gestures and expressive or interactive nonmanuals used in both SpLs and SLs, on the other hand. In SpLs, the palm-up family of gestures (called ‘Open Hand Supine’ in Kendon 2004 and ‘Palm Up Open Hand’ in Müller 2004) comprises gestures with the following kinetic features: an open lax handshape with extended (not spread) fingers, a supine forearm, and an upward facing of the hand. Their shared semantic theme is assumed to be linked, at some point, to a ‘giving/offering’, or ‘readiness to receive’ core meaning (Müller 2004). The three-fold classification of their uses in context (Kendon 2004) includes: (i) the palm presentation gestures; (ii) the palm addressed gestures; and (iii) the lateral palm gestures. These co-speech gestures are said to be pragmatic gestures (Kendon 2004), as they contribute to the meaning of the utterance in fulfilling a modal (e. g. by intensifying the expressive content), a performative (e. g. by highlighting a question), or a parsing function (e. g. by marking the discourse’s structure) in combination with the verbal utterance and its context. Pragmatic gestures, in the same manner than verbal pragmatic markers (Aijmer & Simon-Vandenbergen 2011) are also said to be multifunctional: for instance, one single palm-up gesture can at the same time have a modal and a parsing function (see Ferré 2011). Research on palm-ups in SLs is mostly based on Kendon’s (2004) work, whose palm-up functions have also been found in some of the SLs studied (Engberg-Pedersen 2002; Colin et al. 2003; Kooij et al. 2006; Zeshan 2006; Halvorsen & Guri 2011; van Loon 2012; McKee & Wallington 2012). These functions include the expression of modality, backchannel signal, addressee’s involvement, turn initiating or ending, and pause filler. Some palm-ups seem to have undergone grammaticalization from gesture into SL, making them liable to be used as connective, negative marker or question particle, among other possibilities (van Loon 2012). As stated in Kendon (2004 : 265), the more extensive and salient the nonmanuals are, the more expressive the information conveyed by the gesture may be. In line with this view, the present paper will study the use of palm-ups and the co-occurring nonmanuals in both Belgian spoken French and French Belgian Sign Language (LSFB). To the best of our knowledge, only McKee & Wallingford (2012) propose a first <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparison</b> between a SL and a SpL. Our purpose is to go a step further by: (i) comparing the frequency of palm-ups per minute with regard to the number of signs in LSFB and to the number of words and gestures in spoken French, (ii) studying the alignment of the palm-ups with nonmanuals in scope and timing in both modalities, (iii) investigating the nonmanuals that are layered with palm-ups in order to see the functions that such combinations fulfill in each language, (iv) carrying out the first cross-linguistic study on the use of palm-ups between a spoken and a signed language in elderly people; and (v) building an interoperable model for the annotation of pragmatic gestures and their functions in both SpL and SL. The approach is a corpus-based method of video data analysis (using the ELAN software) and follows from a form-based approach to gesture and sign. The corpus data comprise four samples of (audio and) video data (duration: approx. 20 min.) that are made up of interviews with two hearing French-speaking women (75 and 84 y. old; CorpAGEst corpus) and two deaf LSFB-signing men (75 and 84 y. old; LSFB corpus). The data are elicited through face-to-face interviews with a family member in SpL (task: talking about some major steps of aging in their past life) and with a moderator in SL (task: explanation of a past memory). The underlying main hypothesis is that there would be an imbalanced use of manuals and nonmanuals between the four speakers, as well as differences in terms of scope/alignment and timing of the nonmanuals layering palm-up gestures (see Herrmann & Steinbach 2013), to convey similar pragmatic meaning in use. In particular, we expect more structuring, expressive and interactive nonmanuals than pragmaticalized gestures in the two oldest people, as well as a less strict alignment of nonmanuals and palm-ups in their interactions, taking for granted that there is an increasing need for a certain gestural economy with advancing age (Feyereisen & Havard 1999) (due to age-related physiological and cognitive changes, such as arthritis or the slowing of information processing) ...|$|E
