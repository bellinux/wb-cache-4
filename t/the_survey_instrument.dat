The team designed the survey measurements to include both the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault on campus, as well as perceptions of campus climate. The methodological team drew heavily upon behavioral-specific questions from the Sexual Experiences Survey to measure the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault, because such questions have been researched and validated. (1) The design features of this survey have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing response errors in web surveys, as well as minimizing overall respondent burden.

50|$|Users {{of surveys}} must {{consider}} the potential for mode effects when comparing results from studies in different modes.

50|$|The ceiling {{effect is}} {{the level at which}} an {{independent}} variable no longer has an effect on a dependent variable, or the level above which variance in an independent variable is no longer measured or estimated. An example of the first meaning, a ceiling effect in treatment, is pain relief by some kinds of analgesic drugs, which have no further effect on pain above a particular dosage level (see also: ceiling effect in pharmacology). An example of the second meaning, a ceiling effect in data-gathering, is a survey that groups all respondents into income categories, not distinguishing incomes of respondents above the highest level asked about in <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of audio-CASI, then, {{are that the}} addition of audio makes CASI fully applicable to a very wide range of respondents.

This may be because wearing headphones increases the insulation of the respondent for external stimuli, and also may be {{explained by the fact that}} the recorded human voice in the audio component evokes a more personalized interaction between the respondent and the instrument.|$|E

50|$|How {{we measure}} social capital {{depends on how}} we define it.

[...] This results in a ceiling effect in that persons who smoke three packs or more a day are not distinguished from persons who smoke exactly two packs. A population survey about income similarly might have a highest response level of [...] "$100,000 per year or more," [...] rather than including higher income ranges, as respondents might decline to answer at all if the survey questions identify their income too specifically. This too results in a ceiling effect, not distinguishing persons who have an income of $500,000 per year or higher from those whose income is exactly $100,000 per year.|$|E

40|$|The {{procedural}} {{survey on}} sexual harassment procedures sent to 300 Texas principals had {{a response rate of}} 48. 3 %. The mean score on the procedural survey for all 300 principals was 69. 30 %. Eighteen research questions were addressed in detail in Chapter 4. Only five showed a significant correlation or effect size. Question 5 asked if there was a correlation between gender and the mean score of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> regarding sexual harassment procedures. The mean score of women was significantly higher than men. Question 6 asked if there was a correlation between the number of students in a school and the mean score of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> regarding sexual harassment procedures. This revealed that a significant correlation appeared between principals who worked at larger schools. Question 10 asked if there was a correlation between the location of the school, whether rural, urban, or metroplex and the mean score of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument.</b> Principals of urban and metroplex schools scored significantly higher. Question 13 asked if there was a correlation between the hours of sexual harassment training attended in the last year and the mean score of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> regarding sexual harassment procedures. The results of this analysis revealed that a correlation approaching a medium effect size of. 237 was present. Question 18 asked if there was a correlation between the total number of hours a principal had attended training and the mean score of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument.</b> Neither the Pearson's correlation or the Spearman's rho was statistically significant. However, due to the large variation in responses on the sum of hours of training about sexual harassment, it was suspected {{that there might be a}} covariate accounting for sub-populations within the principals who participated in the survey. For ages 30 - 43. 5, as the number of total training hours increased, the mean score on <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>instrument</b> also increased.
