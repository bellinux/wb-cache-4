Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{are urged}} to prepare for {{congregation}} meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature, {{and are expected to}} read all magazines and books published by the Society. One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study. Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.|$|E

Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves you wanting <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> once you finish it. My guess is that this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E

Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the [...] "heart of the novel", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a [...] "fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further." [...] Risen wished <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> about the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book [...] "gloss over" [...] how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as [...] "underdeveloped", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt [...] "rushed".|$|E

500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought me into the Socialist movement... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E

[...] From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature. These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.|$|E

2500|$|In the beginning, {{there were}} no printed catalogs of the library to assist readers in {{choosing}} books and readers were not admitted within the railing to take down books for examination themselves. There was interest in evening hours, but the increased expense this would have entailed and the danger of fire from gas lighting prevented it. The books were classified using the system in Brunet's Manuel du Libraire which Cogswell thought the most complete and most generally known. Cogswell thought his readers showed good taste in their selections “except the young fry, who employ all the hours {{they are out of}} school in reading the trashy, as Scott, Cooper, Dickens, Punch, and the Illustrated News.” For the first year the average daily use was about 100 volumes, with a total for the year of about 30,000. No one topic seemed to dominate the rest, though on the whole the fine arts collection was the most extensively used. The number of readers in the first year varied from 30 for the lowest day to 150 for the highest. For some time, the library was beset by crowds of schoolboys who “come in at certain hours of the day <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> <b>more</b> for amusement than improvement, and shun their classical lessons by the use of English translations.” On Cogswell's recommendation, the trustees raised the age limit to 16. In Cogswell's judgment, by this act the library “assumed its proper character, and became a place of quiet study, where every one found ample accommodation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{complicated}} task for admissions staff at selective colleges to analyze and process thousands of applications with a [...] "huge mail deluge" [...] since there are often six pieces of mail for each applicant, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application itself. College admissions personnel spend less time on average reading each particular application; in 2009, the average admissions officer was responsible for analyzing 514 applications, and the trend was {{in the direction of}} officers having <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>more</b> and more applications. A typical college application receives only about 25 minutes of reading time, including three to five minutes for the personal essay if it is read. Advisors suggest that understanding some of the criteria can help an applicant apply to colleges with greater success. Some colleges extract information from the federal FAFSA financial aid form, including names of other schools the applicant is applying to. Counselors urge students and parents to understand what types of things colleges tend to look for in applications, and plan accordingly. A key attribute admissions evaluators look for, according to Mamlet and Vandevelde, is authenticity—a real person who comes through the application, not a packaged artificial entity or distortion crafted to impress an admissions officer. An admissions officer at Vanderbilt University wrote about how their office evaluates applicants: [...] "It's really about, 'What did I take advantage of in the environment I was given.'" [...] Several reports suggested that colleges were not looking for the [...] "well-rounded kid" [...] but rather a [...] "well-rounded class": ...|$|E
