5|$|Amalthea is in a {{close orbit}} around Jupiter and is within <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. From its surface, Jupiter would appear 46.5 degrees in diameter. Amalthea is {{the largest of the}} inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter. Irregularly shaped and reddish in color, it is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E

5|$|Skirting <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{asteroid}} belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here {{the two families}} of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the {{asteroid belt}}.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable {{due to the}} gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales {{of the order of}} 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface. It is irregularly shaped and reddish in colour, and is thought like Amalthea to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and high mountains—some of them are comparable {{to the size of}} the moon itself.|$|E

25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified atherosclerotic plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by the distance between <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> calcification (actually this leaves {{out most of the}} media) and <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen. This is a far more complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and angiographic contrast agents.|$|R
5|$|The {{volume of}} the vulcanoid zone is very small {{compared}} to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, tending to lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are unlikely to have inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury's Lagrange points, are also possible.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; {{they have}} {{prograde}} orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane. They include the seven major satellites, four small moons {{that exist in}} a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring. Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A Ring, within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, which is sufficient {{to make it a}} planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary umbel, followed {{about a week later}} on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU {{from the}} Sun, {{is called the}} asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, {{a large number of}} planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore turret in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of ball bearings underneath <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, {{as long as it}} is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
