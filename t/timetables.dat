40|$|Constructing a {{satisfactory}} conflict-free semester-long <b>timetable</b> of courses {{and creating a}} similarly satisfactory conflict-free <b>timetable</b> for end-of-semester final examinations are two closely related and often difficult problems that colleges and universities face each semester. We discuss the relevance of such <b>timetabling</b> problems as a natural and practical application of graph coloring, and develop a mathematical and computational model for solving university <b>timetabling</b> problems using techniques of graph coloring that incorporates the satisfaction of both "essential" <b>timetabling</b> conditions (i. e., conditions or constraints that must be satisfied {{in order to produce}} a legal or feasible <b>timetable)</b> as well as suggested "preferential" <b>timetabling</b> conditions (i. e., additional conditions or constraints that need not necessarily be satisfied to produce a legal or legitimate <b>timetable,</b> but if satisfied may very well produce a more "acceptable" <b>timetable</b> for students and/or faculty members). We discuss in detail the step-by-step process that is taken to implement our timetabling-by-graph-coloring procedure, from the assembling of university course data, to creating a course conflict graph based on the assembled data, to coloring the conflict graph, to transforming this coloring to a conflict-free <b>timetable,</b> to finally assigning courses to classrooms. Once a conflict-free <b>timetable</b> of courses has been constructed, we present ways in which such a course <b>timetable</b> for a particular semester can be used to construct a conflict-free <b>timetable</b> of final examinations.

However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to <b>timetables.</b> Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer <b>timetables.</b> This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station.

Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as The Zulu. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a brief {{introduction}} to some recent approaches to <b>timetabling</b> problems that have been developed or are under development in the Automated Scheduling, Optimisation and Planning Research Group (ASAP) at the University of Nottingham.

Firstly, recent heuristic and evolutionary <b>timetabling</b> algorithms are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments are described: a method for decomposing large real-world <b>timetabling</b> problems and a method for heuristic initialisation of the population. Secondly, an approach that considers <b>timetabling</b> problems as multicriteria decision problems is presented. Thirdly, we discuss a case-based reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve new <b>timetabling</b> problems.

However, to obtain a good quality <b>timetable</b> we have to satisfy as many soft constraints as possible.

5|$|After the {{takeover}} of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982, the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal. Many trains bypassed the station in favor {{of going to the}} nearby Newark Broad Street Station.

However, as of the official September 1984 <b>timetables,</b> service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street, East Orange (on the Morris & Essex) or Ampere (on the Montclair Branch), both of which closed in April 1991. On September 16, 1984, trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue, and the station was closed permanently. Although the station was closed, Roseville Tower, for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines, remained in service for almost two more decades. In 2002, during construction of the Montclair Connection, the tower was demolished in favor of expanding the cut in Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair-Boonton Line.|$|E
5|$|State {{funding was}} allocated, {{allowing}} {{the airport to}} be upgraded. The regional airport opened on 1 August 1974, {{the same day as}} four other airports in Finnmark. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Berlevåg. Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973. Because of the steadily more regular flights to Berlevåg, Norving applied to the government for permission to operate these as taxi routes. While the airline had been forced to operate its taxi service on the time specifications of the customer, taxi routes would allow the airline to operate feeder services with <b>timetables.</b> No such permission was granted. Widerøe took over operations from 1 August 1974 using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. On 14 November 1980 the garage and workshop burned down; a new building was built and opened in 1982. The passenger terminal was expanded in 1988 with a new arrivals and departure hall. Widerøe introduced the Dash8 in 1994. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for 2.2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) being paid to Berlevåg Municipality.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} studying examination <b>timetabling</b> problems {{focus on}} either benchmark problems or problems from practice encountered in their institutions. Hyperheuristics are proposed as generic optimisation methods which explore the search space of heuristics rather than direct solutions.

The target instances include both the Toronto and ITC 2007 benchmarks and the examination <b>timetabling</b> problem at KAHO Sint-Lieven (Ghent, Belgium). The Toronto and ITC 2007 benchmarks are post-enrolment based examination <b>timetabling</b> problems, whereas the KAHO Sint-Lieven case is a curriculum-based examination <b>timetabling</b> problem.

Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present {{at the opening of}} the line, rode the steam shuttle to Chalfont& Latimer and back, and attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published <b>timetables.</b> This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam-powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this time worked by a British Rail diesel multiple unit, was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains.|$|E
