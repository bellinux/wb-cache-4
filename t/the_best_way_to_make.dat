5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her fall asleep.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The {{next step was to}} glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E

500|$|In October 1977, he {{replaced}} Len Ashurst as manager at Sheffield Wednesday, who were then {{bottom of the}} Third Division. He appointed as his assistant Maurice Setters, who had experience managing at that level but had effectively ruled himself out of another management job after taking Doncaster Rovers to court for unfair dismissal. The two agreed that while the standard of football in the division was low the work rates were high and so <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> progress would be to play long balls into the opposition penalty area whilst recruiting big defenders to avoid being caught out by opposition teams with similar tactics. He took the [...] "Owls" [...] to mid-table safety with a 14th-place finish in the 1977–78 season, though they did suffer embarrassment by being knocked out of the FA Cup by Northern Premier League side Wigan Athletic.|$|E

In order [...] "to make the change permanent", Shrek must kiss Fiona [...] "by midnight". Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Fiona happy is to let her go.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} the childfree choice {{consider}} such a choice to be selfish. The rationale of this position is the assertion that raising children {{is a very important}} activity and so not engaging in this activity must therefore mean living one's life in service to one's self. The value judgment behind this idea is that individuals should endeavor to make some kind of meaningful contribution to the world, but also that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a contribution is to have children. [...] For some people, one or both of these assumptions may be true, but others prefer to direct their time, energy, and talents elsewhere, in many cases toward improving the world that today's children occupy (and that future generations will inherit).|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps. In the trial version, the player can only select Zeus, but there are nine gods available in the full version of the game. There was debate during Age of Mythologys construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them [...] "fair" [...] while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented {{that one of the reasons}} Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a [...] "faceless drone in another building".|$|E
2500|$|Though Schleicher {{approved}} of Papen's politics, a certain tension had emerged partly because Papen had proved himself far more aggressive and assertive than Schleicher had expected as the goofy Fränzchen {{had become a}} man who saw himself as one of history's Great Men and partly because Schleicher dis{{approved of}} Papen's style of provoking ordinary people with the general telling the chancellor that insulting people was not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them like you. Schleicher wanted the [...] "New State" [...] to enjoy popular legitimacy, and was increasing convinced that Papen's massive unpopularity would denude the [...] "New State" [...] of any legitimacy. On 27 October 1932, the Supreme Court of Germany in a convoluted ruling declared that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal as Papen's lawyers had failed to prove his claim that the coup was necessary because the Social Democrats and Communists were allegedly about to merger, but also allowed for Papen to retain his control of Prussia, giving no means for Braun to resume office as {{the court ruled that}} the Reich government could depose a Land government if law and order were threatened. In November 1932, Papen showed his contempt for the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, sixteen U-boats and six battleships, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. Versailles had forbidden Germany to have battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines.|$|E
