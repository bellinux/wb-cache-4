5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of <b>that</b> <b>movement,</b> the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Reitz was an {{important}} figure in Afrikaner cultural life. He was a poet, and published many poems in Afrikaans, making him a progenitor {{of the development of}} Afrikaans as a cultural language. As such he sympathised with the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of Real Afrikaners), established in the Cape Colony in 1875. Although he never became a member himself, he was an active contributor to the society's journal, Die Suid-Afrikaansche Patriot. With his literary work, Reitz was solidly anchored in the so-called First Afrikaans Language Movement, although he was less interested in the didactic drive of <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> than in writing in Afrikaans as a purely cultural activity. Much of his work was based on English texts, which he translated, edited, and adapted. In the process he produced completely new works of art.|$|E

5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with <b>that</b> <b>movement.</b> Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Palestine in 1918, al-Hajj Muhammad {{supervised}} his family's land possessions and entered the trade business. He {{became one of the}} prominent local grain traders in Palestine {{during the early years of}} the Mandate. Coinciding with this period, al-Hajj Muhammad became an ardent opponent of Zionism and British support for <b>that</b> <b>movement.</b> The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, unrest in 1923 and the 1929 Palestine riots all extended into Tulkarm and al-Hajj Muhammad was angered at the coercive manner in which the British authorities quelled the Palestinian Arab participants. His business eventually went bankrupt after the Mandate adopted new economic policies that saw the import of cheaper, foreign wheat at the expense of local produce. His disaffection of British economic policies partly motivated his future participation in the Palestinian Arab revolt in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. <b>That</b> <b>movement</b> took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary: Do not quote without {{permission}} Credit markets {{play an important}} role in the macroeconomy and credit market data is often used to predict both future macroeconomic and stock market performance. In this paper we propose a tractable general equilibrium asset pricing model with heterogeneous firms <b>that</b> links <b>movements</b> in stock and bond markets to macroeconomic activity. The model suggests <b>that</b> <b>movements</b> in risk premia in corporate bond markets are an important determinant of aggregate fluctuations. We show <b>that</b> <b>movements</b> in credit spreads forecast recessions by predicting future movements in corporate investment. Endogenous movements in credit markets allow our model to quantitatively match the observed conditional and unconditional movements in stock market returns and credit spreads with a reasonable amount of aggregate volatility...|$|R
5|$|Lee's {{order has}} been criticized because it left too much {{discretion}} to Ewell. Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause movement (most prominently Jubal Early, despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time) have speculated how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently {{the second day of}} battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill, commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike. Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac, although <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee.|$|E
5|$|MD 30 {{enters the}} town of Manchester as Main Street as the highway passes by Manchester Valley High School. In the center of town, the highway intersects Westminster Street and York Street; along the latter street is Charlotte's Quest Nature Center. MD 30 meets the {{northern}} end of MD 27 (Manchester Road) on the northern edge of downtown and the southern end of MD 86 (Lineboro Road) at the north town limit. There is no direct access from southbound MD 30 to northbound MD 86; <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> is made via Hallie Avenue, the next intersection to the south. MD 30 crosses Dug Hill Ridge just north of MD 86 and passes through the community of Melrose, where the highway intersects MD 496 (Bachmans Valley Road) and Wentz Road. The state highway follows {{the upper reaches of the}} South Branch of Gunpowder Falls through a ridge to the river's source before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues as PA 94 (Baltimore Pike) through southwestern York County to Hanover.|$|E
5|$|On July16, Fengshen turned sharply westward {{due to a}} {{subtropical}} ridge to its northwest, and it maintained <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> {{for the next four}} days. By late on July18, the JMA estimated that Fengshen attained maximum sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute), around the same time the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24hours, Fengshen weakened slightly and began a turn to the northwest. The weakening was possibly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and although previously it was a small storm, the typhoon gradually increased in size. Around that time of its weakening, Fengshen began undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with Typhoon Fung-wong; the latter looped to the south of Fengshen and dissipated on July29. On July21, Fengshen began re-intensifying, and the JMA reported that the typhoon again reached winds of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute). At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of 270km/h (165mph 1‑minute). Fengshen retained much of its intensity until July22, being a super typhoon for five days. This set the record for greatest duration at the intensity, surpassing the previous record of 114hours set by Typhoon Joan in 1997; Fengshen's record was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Paul Griffiths {{wrote that}} the work was [...] "now well {{established}} as a major monument to <b>that</b> strange <b>movement</b> known as the 'avant garde': composed between 1957 and 1962, it is indeed a testimony to <b>that</b> <b>movement's</b> heyday".

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} possibility <b>that</b> gamma <b>movement</b> affects the time {{error in the}} successive comparison of the lengths of two briefly presented lines. The first experiment discovered <b>that</b> gamma <b>movement</b> was greatly reduced in peripheral vision. The second indicated that time errors had two components, one attributable to gamma movement and one to the absolute-impression bias. In agreement with the finding <b>that</b> gamma <b>movement</b> was reduced peripherally, the third experiment showed that for peripheral lines the time-error component attributable to gamma <b>movement</b> vanished while <b>that</b> attributable to the absolute-impression bias persisted. Thus, it seems likely <b>that</b> gamma <b>movement</b> affects time errors...|$|R

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea <b>that</b> <b>movement</b> helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternative}} to the movement approach to wh-movement and discontinuities in general is feature passing.
