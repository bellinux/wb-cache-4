5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped.

However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E

2500|$|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State {{begins with}} an {{extensive}} discussion of Ancient Society which describes <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stages</b> of human development as commonly understood in Engels' time. It is argued that the first domestic institution in human history was not the family but the matrilineal clan. Engels here follows Lewis H. Morgan's thesis as outlined in his major book, Ancient Society. Morgan was an American business lawyer who championed the land rights of Native Americans and became adopted as an honorary member of the Seneca Iroquois tribe. Traditionally, the Iroquois had lived in communal longhouses based on matrilineal descent and matrilocal residence, an arrangement giving women much solidarity and power. Writing shortly after Marx’s death, Engels stressed the theoretical significance of Morgan’s highlighting of the matrilineal clan: ...|$|E

50|$|Both the Nova and Saturn rockets, which {{shared a}} similar design and could share some parts, were {{evaluated}} for the mission.

50|$|Díaz {{changed his}} {{focus to the}} 1500 metres from 1997 onwards and he knocked more than six seconds off his {{personal}} best that year, setting a time of 3:34.52 minutes.

A consecutive fourth-place finish at the 1998 European Athletics Indoor Championships saw him again outside of the medals on <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stage.</b> He improved his time further to 3:32.17 minutes in July 1998 and came seventh at the 1998 IAAF Grand Prix Final that year. A surprise European indoor record for the 1500 m came {{at a meeting in}} Piraeus in February 1999 as he bettered Peter Elliott's record by over second with a run of 3:33.32 minutes. He ran another fast time at the 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships the following month, just a little slower than Elliott's former record, but was beaten by Haile Gebrselassie and Laban Rotich, taking the bronze medal for his first podium finish on <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> 1999 World Championships in Athletics in Seville saw Díaz, alongside Reyes Estévez and Fermín Cacho, vying for the 1500 m medals on home turf. In the fastest race ever seen at the competition, Díaz ran a personal best of 3:31.83 minutes but he ended up behind his compatriots with a fifth-place finish.|$|R
