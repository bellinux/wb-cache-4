5|$|Before the Voyager 1 {{encounter}} with Io on March 5, 1979, Io {{was thought to}} be a dead world much like the Moon. <b>The</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cloud of sodium surrounding Io led to theories that the satellite would be covered in evaporites.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occultation}} of 29 May 1979 <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible tiny satellite with {{a diameter}} of about 1km was reported, which was never confirmed.

5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. <b>The</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E

5|$|The most {{interesting}} and surprising results occur when i>n.

5|$|After Palmyra's {{destruction}} in 273, {{it became a}} market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural circularly permuted protein, {{researchers}} {{looked for}} a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well from the late 12th century.

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common raven's nest.|$|E
