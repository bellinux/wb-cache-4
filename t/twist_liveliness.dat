For this purpose, yarns having different twisting coefficients and different numbers were twisted, and afterwards they were exposed to vacuum steaming at different temperatures and for different durations. Linear density, hairiness, unevenness values, tensile properties and <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of these yarns were measured before and after vacuum steaming. The results obtained were assessed by means of COSTAT and SPSS statistical analysis programs and variation analysis, and Student–Newman–Keuls tests were carried out at 5 % (0. 05) level of significance. The {{results of this study}} indicate that the effects of vacuum steaming temperature and duration on tensile properties, unevenness, hairiness and <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of spun polyester yarns, and tensile properties and <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of filament polyester yarns, are statistically significant.

40|$|A {{methodology}} and apparatus {{have been proposed}} to indirectly evaluate <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of spun yarns by measuring the number of snarl turns formed of a yarn submerged in a water bath. A comparative study was carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of water in the measurement of yarn snarls. T tests showed that water has a significant effect in the snarl forming and testing results. Systematic studies were then carried out in the intra and inter laboratories to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed measurement system. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the studies showed that there is no significant difference in measuring <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> between the operators in the same laboratory and between the operators from different laboratories, respectively. The largest variance in the tests is attributed to the expected variation in the level of snarl turns in different yarn specimens. The experimental results showed that the developed yarn snarling apparatus has made accurate and repeatable measurements of <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> over a range of 100 % cotton ring spun yarn counts.

40|$|The {{effects of}} tandem and {{conventional}} vacuum steaming methods on {{the properties of}} yarns Sibel Şardag ̆ and Özcan Özdemir This study was performed in order to investigate the effects of tandem and conventional vacuum steaming on the physical properties of 100 % cotton and 100 % viscose yarns. The yarns with different twisting coefficients and numbers were twisted and exposed to tandem and conventional vacuum steaming at different temperatures. Tenacity, unevenness, hairiness, <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness,</b> package hardness values, and spirality of knitted fabrics produced from these yarns were measured before and after vacuum steaming. The results obtained were assessed by means of COSTAT statistical analysis program. Variation analysis and SNK test were carried out at 5 % (0. 05) level of significance. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that the effects of vacuum steaming methods on the tenacity, unevenness, hairiness, <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> and package hardness values of yarns are statistically significant. Although the effects of tandem vacuum steaming vary depending on the temperature applied and the raw material used, decreases are observed in unevenness, hairiness, <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> and package hardness values of yarns...|$|E
40|$|Residual torque or <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of a single-spun yarn, {{among other}} factors, {{is the most}} {{prominent}} and fundamen-tal factor contributing to the spirality of plain-knitted fab-rics and the skewness of denim fabrics made from the yarn. In textile processing, yarn snarling caused by the twist live-liness is also considered a serious problem that leads to yarn breakage, the deterioration of yarn properties, and equipment malfunction [1]. Over recent decades, various testing apparatus and procedures {{have been developed for}} the measurement of <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness.</b> Generally, all of these methods are based on manual operation and can be classi-fied into the three categories of direct, semi-direct, and indirect methods [2]. 1 Recently, computer vision has attracted the increasing attention of researchers in textiles and apparel.

The experimental results show that the yarn modification process can effectively reduce or eliminate residual torque in DREF-III singles yarns as well as fabric spirality in plain knitted structures. The properties and performance characteristics of yarns and fabrics are evaluated, including hairiness, diameter, evenness, tensile properties, and <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of the yarns, and thickness, weight, air permeability, thermal conductivity, bursting strength, and pilling resistance of the fabrics. The effects of yarn production parameters, relaxation, and modification processes are also discussed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
30|$|Research on fabric {{skewness}} is very scarce, and {{no studies}} have been found that investigate the effect of loom settings on fabric skewness. Some studies (Alamdar-Yazdi 2005; Moore et al. 1995) have shown that fabric shear properties and drape are affected by skewness. It was found (Alamdar-Yazdi and Khojasteh 2006) {{that there is a}} positive correlation between <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> and fabric skewness, and the skewness is higher when the twist direction of the warp and weft yarns are opposite to each other. Only Nasan and Stylios (2014) analyzed the influence of backrest position on skewness of woven fabric where they found no significant effect of whip roll settings on fabric skewness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A {{possibilistic}} linear regression, i. e. {{a linear}} regression with possibilistic coefficients, is explained. The application of such possibilistic regression method for modeling of <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> of false twist textured nylon yarns {{as a function}} of percentage retraction has been studied, based on a few available data. It turns out that possibilistic regression method is superior to conventional statistical regression, when {{a very small number of}} observations are available. In such cases the basic assumptions, under which statistical regression analysis is valid, can not be investigated. Based on some criterions, such as the total vagueness of models and the mean of predictive capabilities, the optimum fuzzy model has been derived...|$|E
40|$|The present paper proposes an {{artificial}} neural network model for the prediction {{of the degree of}} spirality of single jersey fabrics made from 100 % cotton conventional and modified ring spun yarns. The factors investigated were the yarn residual torque as the measured <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness,</b> yarn type, yarn linear density, fabric tightness factor, the number of feeders, rotational direction and gauge of the knitting machine and dyeing method. The {{artificial neural network}} model was compared with a multiple regression model, demonstrating that the neural network model produced superior results to predict the degree of fabric spirality after three washing and drying cycles. The relative importance of the investigated factors influencing the spirality of the fabric was also investigated. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|The {{degrading}} {{property of}} cellulose by the enzyme is utilized {{in improving the}} surface properties by removing the protruding fibers {{from the surface of}} the yarn. In this work, the regular and compact yarns made out of same mixing at various stages of chemical processing were treated with cellulase enzyme with different levels of concentration and temperature. Measurement of the weight loss, bending rigidity, wicking rate, work of rupture, shrinkage loss, tenacity and elongation of the yarn were studied for the two different yarns. Bending rigidity and wicking rates were found to decrease and increase respectively in normal yarns compared to compact yarns. All the above trends therefore suggest that the compact yarns are not much affected by the concentration of the enzyme compared to the regular yarns. As the concentration of the enzyme was increased, the weight loss, bending rigidity, shrinkage loss, <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness,</b> tenacity, work of rupture, elongation and wicking rate were also found to vary irrespective of the spinning system...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes the use {{of genetic}} {{programming}} for the mathematical formulation of knitted fabric spirality. Both dry relaxed and wash-and-dry relaxed states of fabric spirality are studied. In total, six parameters are investigated, in which three parameters are derived from yarn and fabric, {{and the other three}} parameters are from the knitted condition. The three yarn and fabric parameters used are yarn <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness,</b> tightness factor and dyeing method, and the three knitting parameters are the number of feeders, rotational direction and gauge. Genetic programming is adopted to formulize the mathematical relationships between above the six parameters and two states of fabric spirality, respectively. For a comparison, a multiple linear regression approach is studied as well. The formulas generated by genetic programming and multiple regression for two states of spirality are comprehensively investigated and compared. Experimental results show that genetic programming, which can model non-linear mathematical relationships, obtains more accurate expressions than multiple regression for both dry relaxed and wash-and-dry relaxed states of spirality, demonstrating that genetic programming is a promising alternative for the mathematical formulation of fabric spirality.

40|$|The fibre {{properties}} of cotton, which vary widely according to genetic and environmental conditions, determine its price and textile processing performance and product quality. It is therefore {{hardly surprising that}} cotton fibre properties are routinely measured for trading and quality control purposes, {{with a great deal}} of research having been, and still being, devoted towards developing instruments which enable the various fibre properties to be measured rapidly and accurately. In many cases, it is also necessary to be able to measure {{properties of}} cotton fibres when they have already been converted into yarn and fabric form. To do so, the yarn has to be dismantled into its component fibres, preferably without significantly changing the fibre properties. This could only be done by manually untwisting the yarn and carefully extracting the fibres from the untwisted yarn, care being taken not to break or lose any fibres in the process. This is a time consuming, laborious and labour intensive process. In view of this, a „yarn dismantler‟ which could automatically, cost effectively and within acceptable time frames, dismantle a cotton yarn into its constituent fibres, without undue damage or changes to the fibres, was developed and patented. This thesis reports the results of research undertaken to further develop, evaluate and optimize the yarn dismantler into the final prototype, as well as those relating to its practical applications, including tracking changes in fibre properties during miniature and pilot scale processing, up to, and including the yarn stage. Initial research undertaken on the original bench and first prototype models indicated that, although they produced very promising results, certain improvements and modifications were necessary, if the dismantler was to perform in an efficient and operator friendly manner at the required speeds. These included changes in the axial position of the untwisting spindle and the perforated screen of the suction drum, increasing the air suction at the perforated drum, installing a new motor for the untwisting spindle drive, separating the drives to the different parts of the unit in order to control them independently, integrating a more effective steaming unit into the unit etc. It was found that the dismantling rate had to be set to equal about 95 percent of the original twist in the yarn, and that steaming of the dismantled (untwisted) yarn on the perforated drum was necessary in order to eliminate any <b>twist</b> <b>liveliness</b> (residual torque) in the dismantled yarn, and enable it to be handled and tested on the AFIS instrument. When the final prototype Yarn Dismantler was produced, incorporating all the above mentioned improvements, it functioned very well at dismantling speeds of at least 2 m/min, enabling the length of yarn required for subsequent AFIS testing to be dismantled within an acceptable time of less than 10 minutes, with excellent reproducibility and repeatability of results, also under commercial conditions. It was found that the AFIS measured length characteristics of fibres from the instrument dismantled yarns compared very well with those of fibres from manually dismantled yarns, differences in fibre length generally being less than 1 mm, and it was concluded from these and other evaluation tests, that the yarn dismantler produced fibres without any significant fibre breakage. Some limited tests, carried out on commercially produced carded and combed yarns, indicated that short fibre content and dust and trash levels, as measured by the AFIS on fibres from dismantled yarn, together with the corresponding Uster Statistics, could enable a carded cotton yarn to be distinguished from a combed cotton yarn. Statistical analysis of fibre test results obtained at the different stages during miniature and pilot plant scale processing of various cottons, clearly showed that very significant changes in fibre properties could be caused by certain of the processes. For example, significant fibre breakage occurred during the drafting on the spinning frame, prior to twist insertion. The thesis provides detailed results of changes in various fibre properties, including length, short fibre content, maturity, immature fibre content, seed coat neps and fibrous neps, which occurred from the lint to the final yarn, as well as on the relationship between the properties of the fibres from the dismantled yarn and those from the lint. The results obtained have clearly demonstrated the practical value of the yarn dismantler in enabling yarns to be automatically dismantled into their constituent fibres, which can then be tested by an instrument, such as the AFIS, and the test results related to those of the original lint fibres, thereby opening up many fields of research and practical applications, some of which are captured under „Recommended Further Work...|$|E
