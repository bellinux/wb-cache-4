40|$|BACKGROUND: Among {{different}} malocclusions, posterior crossbite {{is thought}} to have a strong impact on the correct functioning of the masticatory system. OBJECTIVE: To assess, by systematically reviewing the literature, the association between posterior crossbite and different temporomandibular disorder (TMD) diagnosis: disc displacement and masticatory muscle pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature survey covering the period from January 1965 to April 2012 was performed. Two reviewers extracted the data independently and assessed the quality of the studies. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in 2919 citations, of which 43 met the inclusion criteria. The scientific and methodological quality of these studies was found <b>to</b> be <b>medium-low,</b> independently by association reported. In several studies, posterior crossbite is reported to be associated to the development of disc displacement, muscular pain, and tenderness, possibly linked to a skeletal and muscular adaptation of the stomatognathic system. However, the lack of consistency of the results reported deeply reduces the external validity of the studies, with a consequent impossibility to draw definite conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to establish an association between posterior crossbite, muscle pain, and disc displacement because the distribution of the studies supporting or not supporting the association is similar. The consequences of posterior crossbite on the development of TMDs deserve further investigations, with high sample size, well-defined diagnostic criteria, and rigorous scientific methodologies. Finally, long-term controlled studies are needed to identify posterior crossbite as a possible risk factor for TMDs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In this study, the reliability, {{validity}} and factorial {{analysis of the}} Turkish version of the Scale for the Assessment of Illness Behaviour (SAIB) which was developed by Rief et al., were evaluated. In contrast to other similar scales, SAIB focuses on genuine behavioral aspects and it reflects the multidimensional structure of illness behaviour. Method: The study was carried out with 200 patients in Erenköy Training and Research Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases, Erenköy Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital, and Kartal Research and Training Hospital, and 240 healthy students in Karadeniz Technical University as the control group. Participants were investigated with the SAIB, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Symptom Check List-revised form (SCL- 90 R). SAIB were given to sixty of the student group a month later. Factor analysis for the SAIB items was performed. Internal consistency was examined through Cronbach’s alpha test evaluation. Besides this, test-retest reliability was viewed and the interrelationships with other measures (BDI and SCL- 90 R) were examined. Results: A modest correlation level was obtained for the scale total (r: 0. 68) score. The scale also showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0. 81). Whereas 5 item (item# 6, 11, 18, 19, 20) {{in the control group}} had low item-total score correlation. The Turkish version of SAIB showed a four factor model and explained 44. 7 % of the total variance. The validity analysis of the scale resulted in a significant difference between total scores of the control and patient’s group. Criterion related validity of the SAIB was shown <b>to</b> have <b>medium-low</b> associations with some aspect of the SCL- 90 R, BDI and the number of the SCL- 90 R somatization subscale. Conclusion: The findings of the preliminary study of the internal reliability, test-retest and item-total score correlation, factorial construct, discriminating power for specific groups and criterion related validity of the SAIB indicated that the scale could be used in Turkish population, keeping in mind its limitations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyzed}} the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of landscape patterns in Hailer and around areas. Firstly, landscape patterns types of research area {{were divided into}} water, sand, farmland, city and grassland based on remote sensing images of 1986, 1991, 1996 and 2001 and field investigation. Then the grassland was classified into higher coverage grassland, high coverage grassland, medium coverage grassland and low coverage grassland by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Finally, the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of above-mentioned eight kinds of landscape patterns were analyzed using landscape ecology principle. The results indicated that human activities intensified significant from 1986 to 2001 in research area. The area of grassland landscape decreased quickly, and the fragmentation extent intensified. The dominant landscape in research area changed from higher-high coverage grassland <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> coverage grassland. The expansion of sand landscape is obvious in periphery of road, city and farmland. The grassland vegetation degenerated seriously. Fragmentation of city landscape lightened, and city landscape patches tended to decrease and centralized.

40|$|International audienceThe study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the spatial distribution of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments of the Segara Anakan nature reserve and their potential origins using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total alkane concentrations ranged from 3755 to 129, 027 mu g kg(- 1), and the concentrations of 16 PAHs ranged from 375 to 29, 517 mu g kg(- 1). The ratios of specific n-alkanes (e. g., CPI 24 - 34, WaxC(n), and Paq), including a new proposed index, terrestrial-marine discriminant (TMD), {{as well as the}} ratios of selected PAHs (e. g., Ant/Sigma 178, Fl/Sigma 202, BaAnt/Sigma 228, and IPyr/Sigma 276), showed that the sources of hydrocarbons in the sediments were generally biogenic, including both terrigenous and marine, with an anthropogenic pyrolytic contribution (petrogenic and biogenic combustion). For the environmental risk assessment, a sediment quality guideline (SQGs) comparison indicated that the station risk levels ranged from low <b>to</b> <b>medium-low,</b> except for R 6, which has a greater impact on the ecological risk for marine organisms.

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{relationship between}} {{low birth weight}} and allergies prompted us to investigate a possible pleiotropic effect of ACP 1 on these conditions. ACP 1 is a polymorphic enzyme that affects signal transduction of insulin and other growth factors, T-cell receptor signaling, and the regulation of flavoenzyme activity. Our aim was to compare the relationship between ACP 1 and allergy with the relationship between ACP 1 and birth weight. We studied 299 subjects from the Caucasian population of England, 124 subjects from the Caucasian population of central Italy, and 302 healthy puerperae and their newborn babies from the same Caucasian populations. ACP 1 phenotype was determined by starch gel electrophoresis on RBC hemolysate and by DNA analysis. Subjects with high ACP 1 activity (ACP 1 C,B phenotype) show {{a lower level of}} IgE compared to subjects with low ACP 1 activity (p = 0. 01). The proportion of infants with a birth weight below the first quartile is lower among infants born to mothers with high ACP 1 activity than among infants born <b>to</b> mothers with <b>medium-low</b> activity (p = 0. 01). The data suggest a protective effect of high-activity ACP 1 C,B phenotype from low birth weight and from allergic manifestations after birth...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Blended {{learning}} is {{the integration of}} educational information communication technologies with traditional face-to-face teaching (Colis 2 ̆ 6 Moonen, 2001). In the twenty-first century, with {{the new generation of}} digital native students, adopting blended learning to enhance student learning experience is no longer a question, but a given. But, are all schools able to integrate blended learning into their teaching and learning environments and prepare their students with the necessary digital skills desired by higher education institutions and employers alike? What are the barriers to adopting blended learning by schools that cater <b>to</b> students from <b>medium-low</b> wage households? Significance and relevance of work:: The pilot study is carried out on one private school that caters to students from medium to minimum-low wage households in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. United Arab Emirates is very diligent and conscientious towards educational improvements in the country. The nation 2 ̆ 7 s 2021 vision aims to improve the nation 2 ̆ 7 s education sector to become competitive not just in the region, but in the world (National Qualifications Authority, 2013). The Emirate Dubai 2 ̆ 7 s Ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum always encourages advances in education and the role of information communication technology in boosting education (Arabian Business, 2014). The government has initiated many projects geared to support the public schools and implement technology {{for the benefit of the}} students. However, this research is very timely because it focuses on the private schools in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, particularly those schools that cater to students from medium to low income households. The findings of this study are expected to be beneficial to the following stakeholders:  Private schools  Teachers  Parents Governing bodies Description of research method: As this is the phase one of the pilot study, a mixed-method approach has been used in order to fulfill the requirements of the phase. Existing literature has been analyzed to understand the barriers to blended learning. Then, a qualitative exploratory case study design has been adopted through structured 5 -point Likert scale surveys and semi-structured and informal interviews and focus groups with the chosen private school in Dubai to understand the barriers faced by private schools that cater <b>to</b> students from <b>medium-low</b> income households and teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of blended learning and the process of adoption of blended learning in their school (McMillan 2 ̆ 6 Schumacher, 2010; Maree, 2010). Results: This paper reports the findings of the phase one of the pilot study being carried out in the United Arab Emirates to understand the barriers to adopting blended learning in schools, particularly the lack of funds to acquire information communication technology tools and facilitating training for teachers to help them integrate blended learning with the traditional classroom teaching. More specifically, the report highlights the difficulty faced by the schools that attract students from medium to low-minimum wage households and offer education at a low-fee structure. With a focus on one such school, the report offers insight into the current system of inspections in Dubai, the fastest growing Emirate of United Arab Emirates, that lead to ratings which decide on increments of fees, thereby further placing such schools in deeper predicament. Conclusions: The paper concludes with recommendations based on further review of literature towards a possible solution to help these schools adopt blended learning through collaboration of schools, parents and community, using a proposed Triad Stakeholder Model and paves way for phase two of the pilot study, that of validating the effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|Several {{chemical}} inoculants {{were designed}} and developed {{to study and}} control the primary g-Fe structure and solidification of grey cast iron. The work involved literature studies of inoculation chemistry, the selection of different chemical species such as La 2 O 3, MnO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and CaC 2 which are supposed to act as effective nucleants according to the mentioned literature, and their blending with Fe-powders {{in order to obtain}} some new inoculants. Four commercial inoculants, a Fe/Superseed-powder and a SiC-powder were used as well. These inoculants were tested in a foundry experiment, where the primary structure was obtained through direct austempering after solidification—DAAS-technique. Finally they were evaluated according to the primary austenite grain size, the eutectic cell size and the dendrite arm spacing—DAS—values obtained. The results show that pure Fe-powders are the most effective inoculants in promoting the primary austenite nucleation. Fe/La 2 O 3, Fe/MnO 2 and Fe/CaC 2 powders were found to be effective as well, Fe/Fe 2 O 3 -powders were found <b>to</b> have a <b>medium-low</b> performance, whereas all the commercial inoculants and the SiC powder were found to have negative effects on primary austenite nucleation. It was found that the eutectic phase is obviously influenced by the primary structure. Indeed, three different correlations between the primary structure and the eutectic phase were found depending on the kind of melt considered: inoculated with commercial powders, non-inoculated, or inoculated with noncommercial powders. In the first case, the bigger the DAS the smaller the primary austenite grains, and as a consequence the smaller the eutectic cells. In the second case, the bigger the DAS the bigger primary austenite grains, and as a consequence the bigger the eutectic cells. And in the third case, {{for a wide range of}} DAS values most of primary austenite grains have a diameter around 1100 μm, and as a consequence the eutectic cell have a wide range of sizes...|$|R
40|$|The Zhijiadi Ag-Pb-Zn deposit {{is located}} in the central North China Craton. Fluid {{inclusions}} (FIs) studies indicate three types of FIs, including aqueous, aqueous-carbonic, and daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions. The daughter minerals in FIs are mainly composed of marcasite, chalcopyrite, calcite, and dolomite. Microthermometric data show that the homogenization temperature and salinity of FIs decrease gradually from early to late stages. Homogenization temperatures from early to main to late stages span from 244 to 334 °C, from 164 to 298 °C, and from 111 to 174 °C, respectively, while their salinities are 4. 0 – 9. 9 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., 0. 5 – 12. 7 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., and 0. 2 – 8. 8 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., respectively. Trapping pressures drop from 203 – 299 [*]MPa (the early stage) to 32 – 158 [*]MPa (the main stage). The dropping of pressure and temperature and mixing and/or dilution of ore-forming fluids result in the formation of ore deposit. Combined with C-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions, the initial ore-forming fluids and materials were likely derived from a magmatic system. As a whole, we proposed that this deposit belongs <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> temperature hydrothermal deposit related to volcanic and subvolcanic magmatism strictly controlled by the fault zones...|$|E
40|$|The “Scansano-Magliano in Toscana” area is {{characterized}} by a morpho-structure chiefly made-up by sandstone and shelly-calcareous lithologies. Generally, these complexes host minor aquifers in Tuscany, since they have medium <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> permeability. In the area under examination, a sandstone outcrop develops with continuity along the ridge of the structure for several kilometers and above a shelly substratum. Consequently, this hydrostructural context suggested the possibility that a significant groundwater body was hosted in the sandstones. In order to verify this assumption, an isotopic study was carried out taking into account several wells and springs sited on the sandstone outcrop and its surrounding area; the samples collected over a period of two years were analyzed to obtain δ 18 O‰, δ 2 H‰ and 3 H. A study of the hydrostructural and morphological condition was also performed, and minor springs were selected. The analyses of this spring-water resulted in the characterization of the isotopic features of the infiltration water in the studied area, which represents a fundamental base of work for the interpretation of the data of groundwater points which drain long flow paths. By means of this approach, the groundwater framework was defined and the presence of a significant and continuous groundwater body within the sandstone complex was verified. A preliminary conceptual hydrogeological model was also proposed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish the ability of employees by work ability index (WAI), physical work capacity (PWC), and finding the correlation between them. Establishing the PWC index with attention to WAI values for the purpose of saving in costs and time of PWC measurements is another aim of this project. Methods: The present research is an analytic cross-sectional and one-trail study. The study population consists of 228 randomly selected registered nurses from hospitals in Isfahan (Iran). The WAI and PWC were established through WAI questionnaire and Fax equation and by using ergometer bicycle, respectively. The resulting data were analyzed using SPSS 16 software. Results: Average WAI and PWC among the study population were 38. 25 ± 4. 4 and 4. 45 ± 0. 7, respectively. Pearson test results showed no significant correlation between PWC and WAI in different age groups (r= 0. 3 and P> 0. 05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the variables of age and diagnosed diseases were the most effective factors of WAI (β= 0. 18 and P> 0. 05). Pearson test revealed a significant correlation between the number of diagnosed diseases and PWC index in age groups of 40 - 49 years. Conclusion : Average WAI in this research, like other studies on similar jobs is in the acceptable level of > 36. Work ability index and PWC index in different age groups did not show a significant correlation and this suggests that there are essential discrepancies in work ability evaluations made by each index and {{it is not possible to}} predict PWC index using WAI values. Given the PWC results and the level of nursing staff′s activity (low, medium) the WAI is a suitable instrument to establish the professionals′ abilities. This study revealed that 27. 6 % of individuals were subject <b>to</b> <b>medium-low</b> work ability risk (WAI< 37), which was 1. 8 times that of Finland′s professional health Institute, which could be caused by shift working and increased working hours...|$|E
