25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>silicon</b> solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

However, current implantable {{electronic systems}} are based on technologies more than 50 years old and more medical problems require advanced implantable electronic systems with small form factors and multiple electrodes. This work explores and evaluates possible alternatives of implantable electronic systems. Parylene, a widely used MEMS/CMOS process compatible material, {{is the cornerstone of}} this work. Parylene has been an ISO 10933 and USP Class VI certiﬁed biocompatible material. Parylene serves as the substrate and protective coating of the implantable electronic systems developed in this work. <b>Thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene is studied in this work and <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene transistors are developed. The <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene transistor uses Parylene as the ﬂexible substrate, the gate insulator and the protective coating. Studies of parylene surface are carried out. And based on this study, pentacene hole mobility is improved using spin-cast smoothing layers and top-contact conﬁgurations. To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> pentacene transistors, saline soaking tests are performed. The results are less than satisfactory. In addition, <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous <b>silicon</b> is studied and <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous <b>silicon</b> transistors are developed. This thin-ﬁlm amorphous silicon uses Parylene HT®, a Parylene variant with high temperature stability, as the ﬂexible substrate. To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous <b>silicon</b> transistor, room temperature saline soaking tests and 80 ◦ C accelerated saline soaking tests are carried out. The <b>thin</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> amorphous <b>silicon</b> transistors show excellent stability in saline soaking.

One reason of the low costs of silicon thin film solar cells is its very low thickness (2 µm) compared to silicon wafer (200 µm).
