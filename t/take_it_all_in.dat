2500|$|Still {{there were}} some {{spectacular}} views available to passengers in the Sierras, {{the most famous of}} which was that from [...] just above the town of Colfax where the grade was literally carved {{out of the side of}} a mountain, providing a glorious panoramic view across Green Valley of the American River flowing in a canyon some [...] below. This spot was so popular that for many years the Southern Pacific stopped the Overland and most other trains for a few minutes so that passengers could get off the train and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> from a special observation area.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton {{made his}} long-awaited Major League debut on April 2 against the Chicago Cubs in a pinch-hit appearance, {{receiving}} a 22-second standing ovation. As {{he was waiting}} to bat, Cubs catcher Michael Barrett said, [...] "You deserve it, Josh. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> brother. I'm happy for you." [...] After he lined out, Hamilton stayed in the game to play left field. [...] He made his first start on April 10 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, batting leadoff. In that game, he recorded his first Major League hit, a home run off Edgar Gonzalez. The next night, he hit another. Hamilton was named the National League Rookie of the Month for April.|$|E
60|$|And this recalls my inland {{voyage to}} fairy-land. A true voyage; but, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, {{interesting}} as if invented.|$|E
60|$|Such a hubbub had {{not been}} heard in that town for many a day. Back came Simon Agricola running, and there he saw, and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> in one look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{friends are}} very complaisant to me," [...] said Cecilia {{in a tone}} of voice which seemed to imply that she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> earnest.|$|R
60|$|Guy {{gazed at}} him in astonishment. For a moment he thought his friend's reason was giving way. Then slowly and {{gradually}} he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If this doesn't {{beat the}} band!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "My head isn't {{strong enough to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in.</b> So Crawshay found you out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{trust you}} for {{that part of the}} business. Bill Jepson should be a master hand with a paddle, an' <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, you're bound to push ahead right fast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Richard Wharton was {{the name}} of mamma's first husband. Then I'm not a Callingham at all!" [...] I cried, unable to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at first in its full complexity. [...] "I'm really a Wharton!" ...|$|E
60|$|Barney <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at {{a single}} glance, but his eyes hung long and greedily upon the great, high-powered {{machines}} that chugged or purred about him.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} now, <b>in</b> silence, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> {{might have had}} it before him. [...] "What you want of me then is to make up to a sick girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful old gentleman, ain't he?" [...] {{said the}} discomfited Mr. Smith. [...] "Fancy 'im getting the better o' me. Fancy me being 'ad. I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> as innercent as you please." ...|$|R
60|$|Up to his tenth year Matt {{had lived}} {{with his father and}} mother in the Harlem {{district}} of the great metropolis. He had attended one of the public schools, and, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, had been a happy boy.|$|E
60|$|I {{kiss the}} stones, I kiss the moss on the wall, And wish I could pass {{impregnate}} into the place. I wish I could <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> a last embrace. I wish with my breast I here could annihilate it all.|$|E
60|$|<b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, my gloomy prophecies {{of other}} years were {{substantiated}} in 1918, especially {{in regard to}} the devastated kelp-beds; but {{there have been a few}} silver rifts in the black cloud, and it seems well to end this book with mention of brighter things.|$|E
60|$|Her eye {{and mind}} <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> in one instant, as the {{lightning}} flash reveals a whole landscape. And then her mind became {{as dark as}} that landscape, when the flash is past.|$|R
6000|$|Mamie <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> {{though there}} {{might well be}} more of it than one could quickly embrace. [...] "But if she has had time," [...] she flashed, [...] "to find out he isn't one?" ...|$|R
60|$|In a second, I {{saw that}} Frank and the {{officers}} had <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> in its full ghastliness, and that, if time enough remained, Kea might yet be saved from that awful death in the fiery abysses. Without one moment's delay their men seized the horses, and leaving one or two, officers alone to continue the observations, dashed wildly down the ravine, and into the gloom of the gully.|$|R
6000|$|She stood {{a minute}} irresolute, {{and then she}} began again: [...] "Mr. Chung, I am too horrified to know what I ought to do. I can't grasp it and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> so quickly. If you had money of your own, would {{you be able to}} run away and live somehow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I don't know," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "perhaps they would not. At any rate, if I {{cut them off}} pretty close to the living part of the tree, the bark will then {{gradually}} extend out over the little stump that I leave, and finally cover it over, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> as it were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [4] In this {{connection}} Woodrow Wilson says, [...] "And yet the [...] surprising and delightful {{thing about this}} book (the [...] Autobiography) is that, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, it has not [...] the low tone of conceit, but is a staunch man's sober [...] and unaffected assessment of himself and the [...] circumstances of his career." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Kemp, {{prompted}} by a nudge in the ribs, assented. [...] "It's wonderful how they <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> about me," [...] he said; [...] "but I feel certain {{in my own mind}} that I ought to chuck some money about." ...|$|R
60|$|Rogers came {{promptly}} at {{the appointed}} time, and Lapham {{handed him the}} letter. He must have <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at a glance, and seen the impossibility of negotiating any further now, even with victims so pliant and willing as those Englishmen.|$|R
5000|$|... "Yesterday, a {{cute little}} blonde {{in front of us}} <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> stride, monsters included. She also perked up, leaning forward, for that final reel, when the picture slips from mediocrity into a wildly funny, eerie and casually beguiling adventure, not hard to take".|$|R
6000|$|In the {{absorbing}} {{interest of}} the moment, I poured out those words one after another {{as fast as they}} would pass my lips. Miserrimus Dexter completely falsified the lawyer's prediction. He shuddered under the shock. His eyes opened wide with amazement. [...] "Say it again!" [...] he cried. [...] "I can't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at once. You stun me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, {{when she}} was safely back in Manchester House, with the gas lighted, and as she was pouring the boiling water into the tea-pot, [...] "You may say what you like. It's {{interesting}} in a way, just to show what savage Red-Indians were like. But it's childish. It's only childishness. I can't understand, myself, how people can go on liking shows. Nothing happens. It's not like the cinema, where you see it all and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at once; you know everything at a glance. You don't know anything by looking at these people. You know they're only men dressed up, for money. I can't see why you should encourage it. I don't hold with idle show-people, parading round, I don't, myself. I {{like to go to}} the cinema once a week. It's instruction, you <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at a glance, all you need to know, and it lasts you for a week. You can get to know everything about people's actual lives from the cinema. I don't see why you want people dressing up and showing off." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never spoke}} to him again. Yet I feel sorry for him, feeble old soul, flitting about in the Illimitable, and always so {{punctual}} to hurry to the telephone, so happy, so feeble-witted and courteous; a better man, perhaps, <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, {{than he was in}} life; lonely, too, it may be, out there in the Vastness. Yet I never called him up again. He is happy. Let him stay.|$|E
5000|$|... "Best {{day at work}} ever": Usually said by Finnegan, in {{response}} to something {{that would make the}} average person burst into tears. Finn <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> responding gracefully and elegantly with the heartfelt [...] "best day at work ever". Then again: sometimes it actually IS the best day at work ever.|$|R
5000|$|Rubin, {{though a}} crude writer, <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> from a fairly skeptical {{viewpoint}} and reports in entertaining, thoughtful, and sometimes funny prose. The depth and sincerity of his search is apparent, and {{his call for}} a cooperative relationship between new consciousness and new politics {{is one of the}} more promising prospects of the seventies.|$|R
5000|$|Fuld is {{comfortable}} handling the kidding {{in the clubhouse}} regarding his treatments. [...] "We dish it out pretty good about his insulin shots", said his AA manager Pat Listach. [...] "We always give him stuff about putting needles in the refrigerator, and shooting up in the clubhouse. He <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> stride. He's a good guy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 26. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all, {{the perfect}} duty of a Bishop is {{expressed}} in these six Latin lines,--au mieux mieux--beginning with his pastoral office--Feed my sheep--qui pavit populum. And be assured, good reader, these ages never could have told you what a Bishop's, or any other man's, duty was, unless they had each man in his place both done it well--and seen it well done. The Bishop Geoffroy's tomb is on your left, and its inscription is: ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{listening}} {{with an expression}} of pain, and with both her hands lifted to her head. There was something so wonderful in the idea which he had suggested to her, that her mind was not able to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> at once. [...] "You make my head giddy," [...] she said. [...] "I'm such a poor stupid girl--I feel out of myself, like, when a gentleman like you sets me thinking of new things. Would you mind saying it again, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{write about}} Bishop Mackenzie. Mr. Pritt (at 9.30 P.M. {{the night we}} landed) put his head into my room and said, [...] "Bishop Mackenzie is dead," [...] and I sat and sat on and knelt and could not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in!</b> I cannot {{understand}} what the papers say of his modus operandi, yet I {{know that it was}} an error of judgment, if an error at all, and there may be much which we do not know. So I suspend my opinion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Dora {{considers}} herself engaged, {{and wrote}} to her people at once. I couldn't say a word when she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> solemn earnest and seemed so happy. She's only seventeen, never liked anyone before, and is sure all will be all right; as her father knows mine, and we are both well off. I was so staggered that I said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Our Mr. Stafford <b>takes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> with downcast eyes. [...] . I am a {{competent}} seaman, he says, with his sly, modest air. A ship’s chief mate {{has no doubt}} many opportunities to manipulate the chains and anchors to some purpose. [...] . At this Cloete thumps him on the back: You’ll do, my noble sailor. Go in and win. [...] .|$|R
60|$|Sylvia and Charlie <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>in,</b> pitied, wondered, {{and were}} indignant, {{with all their}} hearts; indeed Charlie was once heard to wish he could only get that horrid old witch near the horse-pond; and when Kate talked of her Diana face, he {{declared}} that he should get the old brute of a cat into the field, and set all the boys to stone her.|$|R
