5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone</b> unintentionally.|$|E
50|$|When a snag {{occurs in}} certain fine {{textiles}} like pantyhose, {{it is called}} a run. This is because the snag breaks at least one fibre, causing the knit <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone</b> in a line which runs up {{the grain of the}} fabric.|$|E

60|$|The {{patients}} were a wondrous lot, and told eloquently of human carelessness. Here were found letters containing articles that no envelope of mere paper {{could be expected}} to hold--such as bunches of heavy keys, articles of jewellery, etcetera, which had already more than half escaped from their covers. There were also frail cardboard boxes, so squeezed and burst that their contents were protruding, and parcels containing worsted and articles of wearing apparel, which had been so carelessly put up as <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>undone</b> in the mail-bags. All these things were being re-tied, re-folded, patched up here and there with sealing-wax, or put into new covers, by the postal surgeons, and done with as much care, too, as though the damage had been caused by the Post-Office rather than by carelessness in the public.|$|R

50|$|The {{cardinal}} {{looks to}} his right and opens his lips as if to begin speaking. Rather than a static figure in which the sitter’s essence in captured by abstracting his character, Bernini has captured a specific gesture to create a likeness that is psychological as well external. The sense of movement is further emphasised by the dramatic creases and folds line his robe, suggesting the movement of his body, and, in the second version, one of the buttons is about <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... cut splice (originally called cunt splice) - A splice {{similar to}} the eye splice. It is {{typically}} used for light lines (e.g., the log-line) where a single splice would tend <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone,</b> the rope being frequently wet. [...] It makes a very strong knot. A cut splice is a join between two ropes, made by side splicing the ends slightly apart, to make an eye in the joined rope which lies shut when the rope is taut. Its original name was bowdlerised to [...] "cut splice".|$|E
5000|$|The role of Maureen {{was written}} {{specifically}} for 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds, and {{was her first}} speaking role in a film. Director David Butler advised her to avoid [...] "acting", and just say the lines the way she would say them herself. Another problem for Reynolds was physical: Because her ears stuck out from her head, {{they had to be}} glued back, but the glue had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone</b> under the hot lights. Reynold's mother eventually solved the problem by having her daughter's ears pinned back surgically.|$|E

50|$|This {{shift from}} {{linguistics}} to topology constitutes {{the status of}} the sinthome as unanalyzable. The seminar extends the theory of the Borromean knot, which in RSI (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary) had been proposed as the structure of the subject, by adding the sinthome as the fourth ring to the triad already mentioned, tying together a knot which constantly threatens <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone.</b> Since meaning (sens) is already figured within the knot, at the intersection of the Symbolic and the Imaginary, it follows that the function of the sinthome — knotting together the Real, the Imaginary and the Symbolic — is beyond meaning.|$|E

[...] Giving the album four stars at About.com, Todd Lyons states, [...] "everything binds together into one masterful meditation." [...] Tim Dodderidge, indicating in a 8.5 out of ten review by Mind Equals Blown, writes, [...] "From start to finish, My Heart to Fear’s debut full-length is an energetic, ferocious, cathartic and inspiring metal album." ...|$|E

5000|$|Weaver booked {{his place}} in the team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi with a Silver medal at the 2010 European Championships in Moscow. En route to the final Weaver had {{defeated}} the Spaniard Rodrigues Molina 11-3 in the 1st round, Sweden's Bashir Hassan-Salad 8-3 in the second and the Frenchman Oualid Belaoura in the quarter finals. [...] A win over Ireland's Tyrone McCullagh in the semi-final set him up for a shot at Germany's Denis Makarov in the final only for him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone</b> by the Germans counter punching skills. The performance of Weaver at the championships drew praise from McCracken the head coach who claimed that the success of the younger boxers such as Weaver in Moscow would send out a positive message {{to the rest of the}} team. [...] Weavers success in Moscow had also vindicated the decision of McCracken to pick him ahead of Luke Campbell, a gold medalist at the European championships held in Liverpool in 2008. McCracken said of the decision [...] "It doesn't matter if you're a reigning champion or number five in the world...You've got to prove yourself because there are others knocking on your door".|$|E

40|$|Europe’s press barons thought they’d {{scored a}} major victory last fall when the European Commission threw its weight behind their idea to create a special {{protection}} for digital journalism, the linchpin of their strategy for long-term survival. But now the plan threatens <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>undone.</b> Advocates of the reform say it would force the globe-spanning fat cats of the internet — platforms like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn, which use outside news content to attract eyeballs without paying a single cent — to compensate Europe’s publishers for use of their content. Much as radio stations pay fees to music publishers to play their songs, the companies would compensate news outlets for carrying their content. If the reform goes through, the victory would reverberate around the world, with publishers in other regions likely to demand similar treatment. Less than {{six months after the}} Commission unveiled its proposal, however, the prospects for a so-called publisher’s right are murkier than ever amid growing doubts the plan can win enough support in the European Parliament.
