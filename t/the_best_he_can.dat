500|$|James Berardinelli {{praised the}} acting and {{considered}} that focusing the narrative on {{the struggle of}} one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg [...] "does <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to make it cinematically dramatic". Total Films review gave War of the Worlds 4 out of 5 stars, considering that [...] "Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record", and describing the film as having many [...] "startling images", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan.|$|E

500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it would be unfair to the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do at this time." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, McCormack co-starred in the A {{television}} miniseries The Andromeda Strain, {{a remake}} of the 1971 movie {{based on the novel}} by Michael Crichton. In the miniseries, he played Jack Nash, a television reporter who battles an addiction to cocaine. The Andromeda Strain received mixed reviews, and McCormack's performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the Boston Globe wrote, [...] "The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters)." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented, [...] "The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends {{the second half of the}} movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let's just say McCormack does <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> with what he's given, and leave it at that." [...] On September 5, 2008, McCormack made a guest appearance in the seventh season and 100th episode of the television series Monk, where he played an unctuous host of a television crime docudrama.|$|E
2500|$|Hermione is {{horrified by}} the cruelty that house-elves suffer, and founds S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, {{as an effort to}} gain basic rights for them. She is Bulgarian Quidditch prodigy Viktor Krum's date at the Yule Ball of the Triwizard Tournament. The proper {{pronunciation}} of her name (Her-my-oh-nee) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do is [...] "Herm-own-ninny," [...] but she has no problem with it. She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of [...] "fraternising with the enemy" [...] in reference to her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her [...] "like a girl," [...] but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At {{the end of the second}} task, Krum asks her to come see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely refuses. Near the end of the term she stops fraudulent tabloid reporter and unregistered Animagus, Rita Skeeter, who had published defamatory material about Hermione, Harry, and Hagrid during the Triwizard Tournament, by holding her Animagus form (a beetle) captive in a jar.|$|E

2500|$|Major Gowen, {{played by}} Ballard Berkeley, is a {{slightly}} senile, amiable old soldier {{who is a}} permanent resident of the hotel. [...] He {{is one of the}} few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the establishment status that Basil craves. He usually wears the Royal Artillery jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their [...] "oldest resident" [...] and in the episode [...] "Waldorf Salad" [...] Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode [...] "The Germans" [...] he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between [...] "wogs" [...] and [...] "niggers"—but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode [...] "Communication Problems" [...] in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.|$|E
