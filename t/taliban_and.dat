5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E

Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO Resolute Support Mission is ongoing. The Philippines and Indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism, also increased their military readiness.|$|E
50|$|Through {{interviews}} with locals, militants, taliban commanders, the film discusses {{the effects of}} the introduction of the fondamentalism in Afghanistan. The film also dwells at length, and sometimes with humor, on hypocrisy of this regime, dealing with drugs, opium and heroin. As Mollah Akhunzada, member of the taliban government, says in the film: the <b>talibans</b> send drugs <b>and</b> poisons to other peoples of the planet and non-Muslims. The film shows also the threat on the Buddhas of Bamiyan, threatened by <b>talibans</b> <b>and</b> Al Qaida militants and then destroyed.|$|R

5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing <b>Taliban</b> <b>and,</b> in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, {{was made up of}} elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> al-Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the fight, the U.S. troops {{remained}} under intense mortar and small arms fire, before the Taliban fighters breached the compound and set fire to it. Romesha moved under heavy fire to reconnoiter the area and seek reinforcements from a nearby barracks, helping the ISAF force to regroup and fight despite being targeted by a Taliban sniper. Romesha led the firefight to reclaim the depot, organizing a five-man team to counterattack while still under fire. He then neutralized one of the Taliban fighters' machine gun teams. While engaging a second, he took cover behind a generator which {{was struck by a}} rocket propelled grenade, and Romesha was wounded in the neck, shoulder and arms by shrapnel. Despite being wounded, Romesha directed air support that killed an estimated 30 <b>Taliban</b> <b>and</b> then took out several more Taliban positions himself. He provided suppressive fire to allow three other wounded American soldiers to reach an aid station and then recovered several American casualties while still under fire. Romesha's efforts allowed the troop to regroup and fight off a force superior in numbers. The fight lasted 12 hours, and eight American soldiers were killed, making the engagement one of the costliest for ISAF forces during the war. Nine soldiers were decorated with Silver Star Medals for the fight. Several days later, the ISAF forces withdrew from the post.|$|E
