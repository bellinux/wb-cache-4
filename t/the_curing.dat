5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E

25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the Bright Leaf tobacco variety (a lighter flavored tobacco leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual logwood. This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from the charcoal was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, lighter tobacco which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco. This trend had not yet hit America for its export market.|$|E

25|$|The {{method for}} {{creating}} century eggs likely came about through {{the need to}} preserve eggs in times of plenty by coating them in alkaline clay, {{which is similar to}} methods of egg preservation in some Western cultures.

25|$|DSC {{is widely}} used in the {{pharmaceutical}} and polymer industries. For the polymer chemist, DSC is a handy tool for studying curing processes, which allows the fine tuning of polymer properties.

25|$|Nitrosamines are a {{group of}} {{carcinogenic}} compounds found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves. Nitrosamines form on flue-cured tobacco leaves during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process through a chemical reaction between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gasses. Switching to Indirect fire curing {{has been shown to}} reduce nitrosamine levels to less than 0.1 parts per million.|$|E
25|$|Cement {{starts to}} set when mixed with water which causes {{a series of}} {{hydration}} chemical reactions. The constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify; the interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength. Contrary to popular perceptions, hydraulic cements do not set by drying out; proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process. If hydraulic cements dry out during curing, the resulting product can be significantly weakened.|$|E
25|$|Special binders {{are used}} in air-set sands to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas {{catalyst}} because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process. The only disadvantage with this is that after the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. A third way to produce room temperature cores is by shell molding.|$|E

25|$|Through the process, the yolk {{becomes a}} dark green to grey color, with a creamy {{consistency}} and strong flavor due to the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia present, while the white becomes a dark brown, translucent jelly with a salty flavor. The transforming agent in the century egg is an alkaline salt, which gradually raises the pH of the egg to around 9â€“12, during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process. This chemical process breaks {{down some of the}} complex, flavorless proteins and fats, which produces a variety of smaller flavorful compounds.|$|E
25|$|Flue-cured tobacco was {{originally}} strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier-poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called 'oasts'). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature {{over the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>curing.</b> The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is heavily}} used, so even relatively minor applications can consume massive quantities. In {{oil and gas}} exploration, salt {{is an important component}} of drilling fluids in well drilling. It is used to flocculate and increase the density of the drilling fluid to overcome high downwell gas pressures. Whenever a drill hits a salt formation, salt is added to the drilling fluid to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum. Salt is also used to increase <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> of concrete in cemented casings.|$|E
25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|E
