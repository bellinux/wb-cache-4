40|$|This diploma thesis {{follows the}} {{degradation}} of inkjet print by ultraviolet radiation and ozone effect for different types of papers. Colour <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> {{for the evaluation of}} accelerated ageing effect of ultraviolet light and gas fading were designed. These <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> were printed by dye-based inks on selected receiving media and exposed to ozone-enriched environment, UV radiation and their combination. The colorimetric values L* a* b* were calculated from spectral data of all patches of the <b>test</b> <b>charts.</b> The ozone effect on the prints was evaluated in the terms of total colour difference and dye concentration. The degradation of dye caused by ozone was observed also in a long-term period, after the contact of sample with ozone was terminated. Results of printed samples accelerated ageing by UV radiation and those that were influenced by the ozone effect were evaluated in the same way. It was found out that UV radiation and ozone treatment have a different effect on {{the degradation of}} dyes. The degradation rate is also strongly influenced by the receiving layer composition of papers used for inkjet printing. Also the catalytic effect of dyes was evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Video of Visual Acuity (VA) and Contrast Sensitivity (CS) <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> in {{a complex}} {{background}} was recorded using a CCD camera mounted on a computer-controlled tripod and fed into real-time MPEG 2 compression/decompression equipment.

In a perception experiment, VA and CS thresholds at the 75 % correct level were obtained for three camera velocities (0, 1. 0 and 2. 0 deg/s or 0, 4. 1 and 8. 1 pix/frame) and four compression rates (no compression, 4 Mb/s, 2 Mb/s and 1 Mb/s). VA is shown to be rather robust to any combination of motion and compression. CS however dramatically decreases when motion is combined with high compression ratios. The data suggest that with the MPEG 2 algorithm the emphasis is on the preservation of image detail at the cost of contrast loss.

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{research}} {{of the relation between}} color vision and fatigue, use of an electric-motor type color-mixer as a new method of measuring fatigue was considered, and, accordingly, the changing phases in relation to a few experimental load work were duly observed, on a result of which the following conclusion was obtained. (1) Provided that illumination is constant, the flicker frequency will become larger as the difference of luminosity of the <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> mounts. (2) Provided that the difference of luminosity of the <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> is constant, a straightline relation is formed between the flicker frequency and the logarithm of illumination. (3) The new method of measuring fatigue by use of an electric-motor type color-mixer, newly worked out by the present author, has been named the color-mixing flicker test. (4) Working on the same principle as the conventional flicker test, the new method is considered to be superior to the former.

The <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> {{were based on the}} triangle orientation discrimination (TOD) test method and contained triangle test patterns of different sizes and contrasts in four possible orientations. In a perception experiment, observers judged the orientation of the triangles in order to determine VA and CS thresholds at the 75 % correct level.

VA is shown to be rather robust to any combination of motion and compression. CS, however, dramatically decreases when motion is combined with high compression ratios. The measured thresholds were fed into the TOD target acquisition model to predict the effect of motion and compression on acquisition ranges for tactical military vehicles. The effect of compression on static performance is limited but strong with motion video.

50|$|The 1951 USAF {{resolution}} <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> is {{a resolution}} test pattern conforming to MIL-STD-150A standard, set by US Air Force in 1951. It is still widely accepted {{to test the}} resolution of optical imaging systems such as microscopes, cameras and image scanners, although MIL-STD-150A was cancelled on October 16, 2006. The pattern consists of groups of three bars (small Ronchi rulings) with dimensions from big to small. The largest bar the imager cannot discern is the limitation of its resolving power.|$|E
50|$|Although 'sharpness' {{is often}} judged on grid {{patterns}} of alternate {{black and white}} lines, it should strictly be measured using a sine-wave variation from black to white (a blurred version of the usual pattern). Where a square wave pattern is used (simple black and white lines) {{not only is there}} more risk of aliasing, but account must be taken {{of the fact that the}} fundamental component of a square wave is higher than the amplitude of the square wave itself (the harmonic components reduce the peak amplitude). A square wave <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> will therefore show optimistic results (better resolution of high spatial frequencies than is actually achieved). The square wave result is sometimes referred to as the 'contrast transfer function' (CTF).|$|E
40|$|Financial {{charting}} {{software is}} widely used in share, commodity and foreign currency exchange markets to visualize and analyze price movements. Its quality is critical because incorrect outputs may lead to wrong analysis and trading decisions, and consequently substantial financial losses. Human visual judgment is often required to <b>test</b> financial <b>charting</b> software because of the graphical complexity of software outputs and limited knowledge of expected outputs. Such approach is labour intensive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an automated testing technique combining metamorphic testing, assertion checking and a novel data label extraction method to eliminate human visual judgment from <b>testing</b> financial <b>charting</b> software. We used this technique to test pre-release builds of a commercial Point and Figure charting software component, and demonstrated that the proposed technique can effectively detect actual faults in the software component. Further, we discuss how the technique can be extended to <b>test</b> other <b>charting</b> software components...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amount of}} chart images with their ground truth are {{essential}} in training and <b>testing</b> <b>chart</b> understanding systems. However, manually retrieving ground truth from real-life chart images is a time consuming and error-prone process. In this project, we propose a procedure that makes ground truthing a fast and reliable task by generating synthesized chart images and automatically obtaining their ground truth. We systematically study the hierarchical structures of chart images, and define 4 levels of ground truth to be recorded. To make synthetic images more helpful in training and testing, we design our own parameterized image degradation model which simulates some commonly seen realworld image defect types. By applying such degradation model, synthesized noise-free images can be further degraded with precise controls. Based on above ideas, we build a software package {{which can be used}} to generate chart image ground truth databases with large sizes in a short time, this will greatly facilitate researchers in training and <b>testing</b> their <b>chart</b> understanding systems.

These experimental broadcasts aroused the interest of the Ministry of Communications, which decided to build a broadcasting tower in Sofia, with a state-controlled channel to air from it. The new channel started with an unofficial broadcast on November 1, 1959, and made its first official broadcast several days later with the live coverage of the November 7 , commemorating the Russian Revolution of 1917. The experimental channel of the MEI did not air anything but a <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> on that day, although it did show a greeting to the new Sofia Television Station three times after 19:05.
