50|$|The cost <b>of</b> three <b>transhipments</b> <b>of</b> coal between {{trucks and}} barges {{meant that the}} Leicestershire pits were still unable to compete with their Derbyshire rivals and in February 1799 the canal's feeder {{reservoir}} at Blackbrook burst its banks following exceptionally severe frosts, causing much damage to the canal and surrounding countryside.|$|R
50|$|From 1891 to 1939, the metre gauge Frankenthal-Großkarlbach Local Railway (Lokalbahn Ludwigshafen-Großkarlbach) {{ran from}} the station to Großkarlbach. From 1890 to 1933, the Ludwigshafen-Frankenthal Local Railway (Lokalbahn Ludwigshafen-Frankenthal) ran to Ludwigshafen. South of the station there was a {{connection}} between the local railways and the standard gauge railway to allow the <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> freight.|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} cargo volumes transferred by sea, {{in combination}} with the increased technological and operational requirements that international competition imposes, lead to the continuous upgrade of infrastructure and equipment of modern port terminals. Within this framework, a number of new technologies for the <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> unitised cargo have been developed and are available in the market. In order to increas...|$|R
50|$|In 2013, the {{standard}}-gauge Yuxi-Mengzi Railway reached Mengzi City; the {{new standard}} gauge Mengzi North Railway Station was constructed next to Yuguopu Station. A {{connection between the two}} stations was set up, providing for <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> freight between metre-gauge and standard-gauge trains. Thus the Caoguan-Yuguopo section of the Caoguan line became a connector between Yunnan's century old metre-gauge Kunming-Hekou line and {{the new standard}}-gauge Kunming-Yuxi-Hekou Railway.|$|R
50|$|The <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> {{goods from}} the Wismar-Rostock {{standard}} gauge {{line to the}} narrow gauge railway proved to be costly and unprofitable. The carriage of standard gauge wagons on narrow gauge transporter wagons as was common, for example, on the Saxon narrow gauge railways, was ruled out from the outset because of the narrow urban section through Bad Doberan. Thus, on 31 May 1969, goods services were withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|After {{conversion}} of the railway track from metre gauge to broad gauge the railway junction has gained considerable importance. A large inland container depot {{has been set up}} near Garhi Harsaru Junction railway station and serves as a hub for <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> containers from and to Bombay port and seaports on the west coast of India in Gujarat. Private ports of Gujarat and large transporters have also constructed container depots here.|$|R
50|$|When World War I started, {{cigarettes}} {{were considered}} a vital war material. Even the YMCA relented, participating in collecting and distributing cigarettes for soldiers. Gaston continued her opposition, {{even to the}} point of filing lawsuits to prevent the <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes through Kansas, where they were illegal. The suits did not stop the shipments, but they resulted in loss of public esteem for Gaston, who was branded as unpatriotic.|$|R
40|$|The {{transhipment}} {{method is}} using a cable trolley system. The two ships are moving on parallel way inthe same direction, between them is suspended carrying the trolley wire. <b>Transhipment</b> <b>of</b> goods is made usingcontainer boxes which are caught by the trolley load jacks. The method offers the advantage of highproductivity, regardless of sea conditions. Basically, the system is usable at high degree of agitation of the sea. Slack in the cable carrier is assured by an automatic tension-adjusting device...|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} by C J Wills and Company with rails and other secondhand {{materials from the}} Great Central and Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railways. It opened in 1915 with the rails extending onto the jetty at Spurn Point. <b>Transhipment</b> <b>of</b> goods and materials from boats would then supply the fortifications and batteries along the stretch of railway up to Kilnsea. Rail transport {{was chosen as the}} roads in the area were narrow and twisting.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, {{transport}} logistics hubs {{do not have}} a storage function. Although there may be a certain buffer capacity due to the transhipment process, this buffer is a kind of side effect and a subordinate of the actual main function – the <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> goods. Transport logistics hubs usually connect many sources with many sinks. Examples for this type of hub can be found in locations of forwarding companies, combined transport terminals, airports and railroad transfer stations [19, 38, 44].|$|R
50|$|The Port of Coatzacoalcos is an {{international}} port of entry that provides <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> oil and petrochemicals.After an upgrade to the railway along the Tehuantepec Route was opened in 1907 by Porfirio Díaz the port sawan increase of shipping via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, particularly from the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. The port saw a decrease in traffic after {{the opening of the}} Panama Canal from 1914 on, but traffic has started to build up since the oil boom of the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} town's {{development}} continued. In 1836, the first steam boat in Siberia {{was built in}} Tyumen. In 1862, the telegraph came to the town, and in 1864 the first water mains were laid. Further prosperity came to Tyumen after the construction, in 1885, of the Trans-Siberian Railway. For some years, Tyumen was Russia's easternmost railhead, and the site <b>of</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> cargoes between the railway and the cargo boats plying the Tura, Tobol, Irtysh, and Ob Rivers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of overlapping gauge is {{to extend a}} railway of one gauge into territory that is mainly of another gauge {{so as to avoid}} <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> specific traffic. For example, a [...] gauge line runs from an iron ore mine in Ukraine to a steelworks in Slovakia, and now may be extended into Austria. Also, there is a portion of four-rail dual gauge 1435 vs. 1520 mm track from Slovakia to Romania (both standard gauge) via Ukraine (Russian gauge).|$|R
50|$|Long {{distance}} trains {{continue to}} follow the Kennet and Avon Canal which runs along the line. Beam engines are preserved at Crofton Pumping Station that once pumped water to the summit level of the canal. The canal goes beneath the line in a 500 yd tunnel beneath {{the site of the}} closed Savernake Low Level railway station, and the remains of the bridge that carried the Midland and South Western Junction Railway. There was never a station at Burbage but the siding served a wharf which allowed <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> goods between the canal and railway.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airfield}} was {{a primary}} transport {{base on the}} Chinese side of [...] "the Hump" [...] air supply route over the Himalayan Mountains, which was used by Air Transport Command for the <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> supplies from airfields in the Assam Valley of India. In 1945, Fourteenth Air Force also used the airfield as a transport base, primarily moving Chinese troops and their equipment from the base to other locations in China. The Americans used the base {{until the end of}} December 1945, when they closed their facilities at the station.|$|R
25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> does not affect the arrival times of future pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> i.e., if pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number <b>of</b> pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R
30|$|Between 1970 and 2010, {{developing}} countries’ {{share in}} the volume of seaborne exports rose from just 18 to 56 % of the world’s total (UNCTAD 2014). Despite this growing participation of developing countries in seaborne trade, evidence on maritime connections suggests that, except for few of them such as China, they may have not reached their full potential. Fugazza et al. (2013) find that {{the average number of}} direct maritime connections, meaning without involving any <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> the transported goods between the country of origin and their destination, is half for developing countries than what it is for developed ones.|$|R

25|$|The world's first {{official}} carriage <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> by rail {{was by the}} United Kingdom's General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> en route first occurred in the United Kingdom {{with the introduction of}} the Travelling Post Office in 1838 on the Grand Junction Railway following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance <b>of</b> <b>Mails)</b> Act 1838.|$|R

50|$|The La Tène era {{also saw}} the {{development}} of armour in the form <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> (chainmail), the familiar form in which a garment is constructed of linked metal rings. Finds <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> are rare, suggesting {{that it was a}} luxury restricted to high status warriors. Crested helmets of this period occur in greater numbers than <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> but overall the picture is of Celtic armies being made up largely of lightly armoured or unarmoured fighters.|$|R
50|$|Radler was {{eventually}} charged with five counts <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> fraud and {{two counts of}} wire fraud. On 20 September 2005, Radler pleaded guilty in a Chicago court to one count <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> fraud {{in relation to the}} 'non-compete' payments.|$|R

The museum will house both British mail carriages, a number of road vehicles and Continental vehicles. This includes the last surviving coach from the Great Train Robbery.|$|R
40|$|USPS drafted an Environmental Strategic Plan {{and formed}} a “Greening <b>of</b> the <b>Mail</b> ” task force [...] a {{partnership}} with several public and private organizations aimed at improving environmental performance and informing {{the debate over the}} environmental impact <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> Despite the efforts of the Postal Service to improve environmental performance, some environmental organizations and competitors of the Postal Service have raised issues questioning the impact of bulk advertising or direct mail on the environment. This study analyzes the environmental costs and benefits <b>of</b> direct <b>mail.</b> Our analysis indicates that the environmental benefits <b>of</b> direct <b>mail,</b> although hard to quantify precisely, are far greater than the costs. To set a context for the discussion of environmental costs and benefits, we begin with a discussion of the composition <b>of</b> direct <b>mail.</b> The majority <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> is mailed at Standard (A) rates (previously referred to as Third-Class rates).
