40|$|The {{formation}} of current filaments in n-type GaAs {{due to the}} low temperature impurity breakdown has been investigated in crossed electric and magnetic fields with a laser scanning microscope. In a highly compensated, low mobility, epitaxial layer the lateral displacement and stretching of a filament due to the Lorentz force has been observed at currents slightly larger than those required to form a filament between point contacts. The <b>transverse</b> <b>elongation</b> of the filament increases linearly with rising magnetic field strength until the filament is disrupted. In this case periodic current oscillations are generated by a repetitive filament ignition and extinction. The elongation decreases with rising current and finally vanishes even at high magnetic fields. This stiffening of a current filament is attributed to an increased electron temperature and mobility in the filament, which cause the charges of the Hall field to be accumulated at the filament borders {{rather than at the}} edges of the sample...|$|E
40|$|Oriented polymer blends {{based on}} {{high-density}} polyethylene (HDPE) are strained until failure. Twodimensional (2 D) small-angle X-ray scattering patterns monitor the nanostructure evolution. Data evaluation methods for high-precision determination of macroscopic mechanical and nanoscopic structure parameters are presented. The hardest materials exhibit a very inhomogeneous nanodomain structure. During straining their domains {{appear to be}} wedged together and inhibit transverse contraction on the nanometer scale. Further components are polyamides (PA 6, PA 12) (20 – 30 %) and as compatibilizer Yparex® 8102 (YP) (0 – 10 %). Some HDPE/PA 6 blends are additionally loaded with nanoclays (Nanomer® or Cloisite®). Blending of HDPE with PA 12 causes no synergistic effect. In the absence of nanoclay, PA 6 and HDPE form a heterogeneous nanostructure with high Young’s modulus. After addition of YP a more homogeneous scaffold structure is observed in which some of the PA 6 microfibrils and HDPE crystallites appear to be rigidly connected, but the modulus has decreased. Both kinds of nanoclay induce a transition from a structure without transverse correlation among the microfibrils into a macrolattice with 3 D correlations among HDPE domains from neighboring microfibrils. For extensions between 0. 7 % and 3. 5 % the scattering entities with 3 D correlation exhibit <b>transverse</b> <b>elongation</b> instead of transverse contraction. The process is interpreted as overcoming a correlation barrier executed by the crystallites in an evasion-upon-approaching mechanism. During continued straining the 3 D correlation is reduced or removed. European Union - Project NANOTOUGH FP 7 -NMP- 2007 -Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia - SFRH/BSAB/ 812 / 200...|$|E
40|$|Microtubules {{confined}} to the two-dimensional cortex of elongating plant cells must form a parallel yet dispersed array <b>transverse</b> to the <b>elongation</b> axis for proper cell wall expansion. Some of these microtubules exhibit free minus-ends, leading to migration at the cortex by hybrid treadmilling. Collisions between microtubules can result in plus-end entrainment (“zippering”) or rapid depolymerization. Here, we present a computational model of cortical microtubule organization. We find that plus-end entrainment leads to self-organization of microtubules into parallel arrays, whereas catastrophe-inducing collisions do not. Catastrophe-inducing boundaries (e. g., upper and lower cross-walls) can tune the orientation of an ordered array to a direction <b>transverse</b> to <b>elongation.</b> We also find that changes in dynamic instability parameters, such as in mor 1 - 1 mutants, can impede self-organization, in agreement with experimental data. Increased entrainment, as seen in clasp- 1 mutants, conserves self-organization, but delays its onset and fails to demonstrate increased ordering. We find that branched nucleation at acute angles off existing microtubules results in distinctive sparse arrays and infer either that microtubule-independent or coparallel nucleation must dominate. Our simulations lead to several testable predictions, including the effects of reduced microtubule severing in katanin mutants...|$|R

The nominal composition of the experimental alloy is Ni- 15 CR- 2 Mo- 4 W- 4. 5 Al- 2. 5 Ti- 2 Ta-. 15 Zr-. 05 C-. 01 B- 1. 1 Y 2 O 3. The 1000 hour rupture strength in the longitudinal direction is about 145 MPa at 1093 C and about 483 MPa at 760 C. The alloy displays normal three-stage creep behavior. Typically the creep elongation is 3. 5 % at 760 C and 2 % at 1093 C. The alloy is notch ductile (K sub 1 = 3. 5). The rupture properties of the alloy are not significantly degraded by thermal cycling or prior stress isothermal exposure. The alloy also has excellent longitudinal high and low cycle fatigue resistance. Limited testing indicates that MA 6000 E posesses good off-axis mechanical properties. The <b>transverse</b> tensile <b>elongation</b> at 760 C is about 3 %. The 100 hour transverse rupture strength is 331 MPa at 760 C and about 55 MPa at 1093 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the {{epidermal cell}} of the insect, Oncopeltus fasciatusy {{has been studied}} in the dorsal abdomen in three situations: during the moult cycle, wound healing and pattern regulation. This behaviour can be classified into seven categories: activation, division, movement, alteration in shape, death, differentiation and cuticle secretion. Data are presented on the first five categories. Aspects of cell behaviour studied during the intermoult period of the moult cycle consist mainly of activation and division. The exact stimuli for this behaviour have not been determined, although an increase in ecdysteroid titre may not be sufficient. The first mitotic figures in the moult cycle are concentrated behind the anterior border of the segment, but later the mitotic index is uniform {{over most of the}} segment. Cell behaviour induced after wounding consists largely of activation, division and movement. Degradation products from damaged epidermal cells are not solely responsible for this activation and the strongest influence appears to be the presence of an incision. Activated cells peripheral to wounds will not divide unless ecdysterone is present. Cells may divide beneath wounds and the condition required for this is probably the disruption of epidermal continuity for a minimum length of time. Cell behaviour after the confrontation of cells from different anteroposterior levels in the segment consists mainly of division and <b>transverse</b> <b>elongation</b> at the confrontation site. The intensity of this behaviour is explained by a difference in positional values between confronted cells so that there is a non-linear gradient of positional values along the segment with a discontinuity at the segment border. If this discontinuity is maintained by a special population of cells at the border, then the regeneration of segment borders {{can be explained by the}} formation of these special cells following the confrontation of cells with almost the maximum difference in positional values...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{division}} and cell expansion during {{early stages of}} tuber development were studied using developing axillary buds on single-leaf cuttings from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Cuttings taken from plants induced to form tubers, by short day (SD) treatment, were compared with cuttings from non-induced (long day, LD) plants. In the apical zone of the buds, cell division occurred {{from the first day}} after cutting, in both LD and SD cuttings. The planes of these divisions were <b>transverse,</b> associated with <b>elongation</b> of the buds. At day 5, a new orientation of cell division was observed in the subapical zone of SD cuttings only. These divisions were longitudinal, associated with radial growth.

40|$|Correlation {{analysis}} of three-station observations of satellite amplitude scintillations, recorded at London, Canada {{during the summer}} of 1968, have been interpreted to give information on the height, size and shape of the ionospheric irregularities. The irregularities had a mean height of 390 km, and when interpreted in terms of the usual axially-symmetric, field-aligned model, had a mean axial ratio of 6. 5, and a mean dimension transverse to the magnetic field of 0. 7 km. None of these parameters showed any systematic trend with geomagnetic latitude. The data for one of the passes analyzed were inconsistent with axial symmetry, and when examined in terms of a more general model, 3 of 9 passes showed evidence of irregularities which were elongated both along and transverse to the earth's magnetic field, the <b>elongation</b> <b>transverse</b> to the field tending to lie in a north-south direction...|$|R
40|$|Atomistic {{simulations}} {{were utilized}} to obtain microscopic information of the elongation process in graphene sheets consisting of various embedded symmetric tilt grain boundaries (GBs). In contrast to pristine graphene, these GBs fractured {{in an extraordinary}} pattern under <b>transverse</b> uniaxial <b>elongation</b> {{in all but the}} largest misorientation angle case, which exhibited intermittent crack propagation and formed many stringy residual connections after quasi mechanical failure. The strings known as monoatomic carbon chains (MACCs), whose importance was recently highlighted, gradually extended to a maximum of a few nanometers as the elongation proceeded. These features, which critically affect the tensile stress and the shape of stress-strain curve, were observed in both armchair and zigzag-oriented symmetric tilt GBs. However, there exist remarkable differences in the population density and the achievable length of MACCs appearing after quasi mechanical failure which were higher in the zigzag-oriented GBs. In addition, the maximum stress and ultimate strain for armchair-oriented GBs were significantly greater than those of zigzag-oriented GBs in case of the largest misorientation angle while they were slightly smaller in other cases. The maximum stress was larger as the misorientation angle increased for both armchair and zigzag-oriented GBs ranging between 32 ~ 80 GPa, and the ultimate strains were between 0. 06 ~ 0. 11, the lower limit of which agrees very well with the experimental value of threshold strain beyond which mechanical failure often occurred in polycrystalline graphene.

40|$|The {{glenohumeral}} joint {{is the most}} dislocated major joint in the body; however despite such {{a high rate of}} injury, the proper treatment protocol remains unclear. Rehabilitation has proved to be insufficient with an 80 % chance of redislocation in teenagers and 10 - 15 % chance after the age of 40. Following surgical repair, nearly 25 % of patients still experience redislocation and complain of joint stiffness and osteoarthritis. In an attempt to improve these results, the normal function of the glenohumeral capsule has been evaluated using both experimental and computational methods. Recent data (strain and force patterns) suggests that the capsule functions multiaxially. Therefore, simple uniaxial methods may not be sufficient to fully characterize the tissue and identify the appropriate constitutive model of the tissue. Inconclusive data has been presented in the literature regarding the collagen fiber architecture and the mechanical properties of the capsule that make it unclear whether the capsule is an isotropic or a transversely isotropic material. For instance, the collagen fiber architecture has been shown by one researcher to be randomly distributed, while another researcher reported the fibers to be aligned. In addition, the axillary pouch {{has been shown to be}} the primary stabilizer of the {{glenohumeral joint}} in positions of extreme external rotation while the posterior region of the capsule has been shown to stabilize the joint in positions of extreme internal rotation. The rate of dislocations, however, is more frequent in the position of external rotation. Therefore, the overall objective of this work was to utilize a combined experimental - computational methodology to characterize the mechanical properties of the axillary pouch and posterior region of the glenohumeral capsule. Using an isotropic constitutive model, the stress-stretch relationship of the axillary pouch and posterior regions in response to two perpendicular tensile and finite simple shear elongations showed no statistical difference. Further, the constitutive coefficients of pure tensile and simple finite shear elongations in the direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (longitudinal) were able to predict the response of the same tissue sample in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the anterior band (transverse). These similarities between the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>elongations</b> of the tissue imply that the capsule is an isotropic material and functions to resist dislocation the same in all directions, rather than just along the longitudinal axis of the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, as previously thought. Further, the coefficients of the axillary pouch and posterior regions of the capsule showed no statistical difference, suggesting that these regions have similar mechanical properties, despite a difference in geometry. Thus, when developing finite element models of the glenohumeral capsule, an isotropic constitutive model should be utilized; and both the axillary pouch and posterior regions could be evaluated using the same coefficients. However, due to discrepancies when comparing the constitutive coefficients of tensile and shear elongations, an update to the constitutive model is required. With the proper representation of the glenohumeral capsule known, finite element models can be developed to pursue the understanding of normal joint function, including the effects of age and gender, as well as injured and surgically repaired joints...|$|R
30|$|Auxin {{participates in}} various {{developmental}} processes. One major effect of auxin is cell expansion, which {{relies on the}} coordinated activities of cellular processes involving microtubules (Ruan and Wasteneys, 2014; Adamowski and Friml, 2015). When cells elongate, cortical microtubules are arranged perpendicularly to the axis of cell <b>elongation</b> (<b>transverse</b> microtubules), while a longitudinal alignment induces growth inhibition. In response to auxin, root microtubules change from transverse to longitudinal, inhibiting cell expansion (Chen et al., 2014). Using the TILLING mutant, which is defective in AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP 1) (abp 1 - 5), it was further demonstrated {{that the effect of}} auxin requires ABP 1 and involves the contribution of downstream signaling components, including Rho-like GTPase from plants 6 (ROP 6), and the ROP-interacting protein RIC 1 (Lin et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). In leaf pavement cells of Arabidopsis, the plasma membrane-localized transmembrane kinases (TMKs) belonging to the receptor-like kinase family has been found to interact with ABP 1. The TMK-ABP 1 interaction is required to activate ROPs, which play a role in regulating cytoskeleton organization and the endocytosis of PIN-FORMEDs (PINs), which are auxin efflux carrier proteins (Xu et al., 2014; Fig.  1).|$|R

Second, the other physical parameters are assessed using an adjoint method for which the direct problem, the adjoint problem and the parameters sensitivities are found as derivatives of a Lagrangian functional with respect to dual variables, primary variables, and parameters, respectively. Due to the ill-conditioning nature of the problem, the proposed method does not allow an exact parameter identification but it does lead to an acceptable tension assessment.

40|$|The {{shape and}} {{strength}} of plant cells is determined {{by a combination of}} turgor pressure and constraining cell wall. The main load bearing structures in the cell wall, cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), are deposited in highly organized textures. For more than 50 years scientists have tried to elucidate how the organized CMF textures are being generated and what role cortical microtubules (CMTs) play in CMF deposition. In 2006 Paredez et al. caused a breakthrough by live imaging of cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes that move along CMTs. However, the mechanism by which CMTs guide CESA complexes is still unknown at the moment of writing this thesis and many questions related to the CMF organization still are unanswered. This thesis illuminates the mechanism behind the highly organized CMF textures. To analyze the positioning and patterning of CESA complexes in the cell we studied the following three aspects: (1) the distribution and delivery (close) to the plasma membrane of CESA complexes via Golgi bodies, (2) the distribution and movement of CESA complexes inside the plasma membrane while producing CMFs and finally (3) their product, the CMF texture of the cell wall. We chose epidermal root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana and compared cells of different growth stages. Chapter 1 is an introduction into cellulose deposition and an outline of this thesis. In chapter 2 the movement and distribution of Golgi bodies is studied in the cortex of cells of different growth stages, early elongation zone compared to late elongation zone, in relation to the configuration of the actin cytoskeleton. Golgi bodies in the cortex of cells in the early elongation zone, where growth accelerates to rapid growth, show slow random oriented movement, called wiggling. In the cortex of cells in the late elongation zone, where cell elongation ceases, they also show a second kind of motility, fast directed movement with velocities of up to 7 µm. s- 1, like in cytoplasmic strands in the same cells. The cortical areas where Golgi body movement is slow and random co-localize with fine F-actin, a configuration of single or thin bundles of filaments. On the other hand, areas where Golgi body movement is fast and directed co-localize with thick actin filament bundles. When Golgi bodies enter an area with a different actin cytoskeleton configuration they change their type of motility concomitantly. We conclude that Golgi body dynamics correlate with the actin cytoskeleton organization. CESA complexes are known to run in rows along CMTs in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells. In chapter 3 we studied the orientation, density, alignment and movement of CMTs and CESA complexes using immunocytochemistry and live cell imaging. Furthermore we studied the orientation and density of the product of the CESA complexes, the CMFs, in the innermost wall layer with Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The CMTs, the tracks of CESA complexes and the innermost CMFs lay in the same orientation, approximately <b>transverse</b> to the <b>elongation</b> axis in both the inner and outer periclinal cell face in the elongation zone and root hair zone, where cell elongation ceases. CESA complexes predominantly move in rows along CMTs in both directions. While the CMFs form a uniform cell wall layer, CESA complexes run one after the other along CMTs that are wider spread from each other than the CMFs and only few CESA complexes move in between the CMTs. To understand how CESA complexes can produce a uniform layer of CMFs, instead of local CMF thickenings, we studied whether the CMTs change position during CMF production. Time lapse movies of CMTs show that CMTs reposition over time, so that CESA complexes produce an even CMF layer. In this way we can understand how the density of CMFs in the nascent cell wall can be higher than that of the CMTs and the moving rows of CMFs in the plasma membrane. CMFs are deposited consecutively next to earlier deposited ones in the same orientation. In chapter 4 we used several different electron microscopy techniques to visualize CMF texture: transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of ultrathin sections after mild or complete matrix extraction, TEM of surface preparations and FESEM of surface preparations. We used root hairs of three different species; Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula and Vicia sativa. We compare and discuss the results of the techniques for the capacity to measure orientation, density, length and width of the CMFs. In ultrathin sections and surface preparations we observed that the three species studied have root hairs with an axial/helical wall texture. Surface preparations are best suitable for density and orientation measurements of CMFs within the most inner cell wall layer. Ultrathin sections showed that the thickness of CMFs in Arabidopsis is approximately 3 nm. which indicates that these CMFs are produced by single CESA complexes. Chapter 5 is a general discussion of our work in relation to the field. It describes the role of the actin cytoskeleton, Golgi body motility and CMTs in the deposition of an organized texture of CMFs.  ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis covers aspects of exocytosis, plant cell growth and cell wall formation. These processes are strongly linked as cell growth and cell wall formation occur simultaneously and exocytosis is the process that delivers cell wall components to the existing cell wall and integral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. The chapters in this thesis describe work on the exocyst, a group of proteins thought {{to be involved in}} polarized secretion, the regulation of CESA complex mediated cellulose microfibril deposition by cortical microtubules, and the organization of cortical microtubules. Chapter 1 is a review in which research on the plant exocyst is discussed. We compare the literature about the plant exocyst with knowledge about well-studied yeast and mammalian exocysts and explore which aspects of exocyst functioning are conserved in plants and which aspects are not. We propose that the plant exocyst has acquired distinct functions and mechanisms in exocytosis for plant cell growth, {{based on the fact that}} each subunit of the exocyst in yeast and mammals is encoded by one gene, whereas some exocyst subunits in plants, particularly EXO 70, are encoded by multiple genes. In Chapter 2, we presented experimental data on the exocyst. Using a yeast two hybrid based approach we present novel interactions between different exocyst subunits. We continue by focusing on the exocyst subunit SEC 3, which functions as a landmark protein in yeast and mammalian cells. We show that both SEC 3 genes in Arabidopsis are essential for plant development; A T-DNA insertion in the SEC 3 A gene causes embryo development to arrest at the globular stage and a T-DNA insertion in the SEC 3 B gene causes gametophytic lethality. We were able to complement the sec 3 a mutant by introducing a pSEC 3 A::SEC 3 A:GFP construct and used the resulting lines to study the subcellular localization of SEC 3 A. The fusion protein shows a similar localization to cytokinetic cell plates as has been shown for other exocyst subunits. In interphase cells SEC 3 A:GFP localizes to the cytoplasm and to the plasma membrane, where it forms immobile, punctuate structures with discrete average lifetimes of 6 - 12 seconds. These puncta are equally distributed over the cell surface of root epidermal cells and tip growing root hairs and the density of puncta does not decrease after growth termination of these cells. Either SEC 3 a puncta may not participate in exocytosis for polarized cell expansion, or the plasma membrane recruitment of SEC 3 is a default process that requires other, polarly localized factors to mediate exocytotic events.   Chapter 3 focused on the role of cortical microtubules in the insertion, guidance and occurrence in the plasma membrane of cellulose microfibril producing CESA complexes. We characterized a wide range of parameters that give insight in CESA complex behavior, such as velocity, density and movement angles in the expanding tip and non-expanding tube of growing root hairs and the same areas in fully-grown root hairs. Then we performed co-localization studies of CESA complexes with cortical microtubules. In tubes of both growing and fully-grown root hair cells CESA complex insertion occurred preferentially on cortical microtubules. Part of the population of CESA complexes that were moving in the plasma membrane was tracking cortical microtubules, whereas others were moving in between cortical microtubules. CESA complexes tracking cortical microtubules had a slightly different movement direction, but also a much lower variation in movement direction than the CESA complexes that were moving in between cortical microtubules. When microtubules are absent, all CESA complexes move in the same direction as those that do not track cortical microtubules in the presence of microtubules, and the variation in the movement direction is similar to that of CESA complexes moving in between cortical microtubules. This shows that CMTs in root hairs focus CESA complex movement, by which they order cellulose microfibrils into a tighter helix. In the absence of microtubules, the average lifetime of CESA complexes increases from 12. 8 minutes to 22. 3 minutes, showing that there is a feedback mechanism between CESA complex insertion and CESA complex lifetime. Since their velocity of movement in the plasma membrane does not change, they produce longer cellulose microfibrils in the absence of cortical microtubules. In Chapter 4, we addressed the question how CESA complexes that are guided by widely spaced cortical microtubules can produce a uniform layer of cellulose microfibrils with a much smaller spacing in axially growing root epidermal cells. We studied the orientation, density, alignment and movement of cortical microtubules and CESA complexes using immunocytochemistry and live cell imaging of root epidermal cells. The CMTs, the rows of CESA complexes and the innermost CMFs lay in the same orientation, approximately <b>transverse</b> to the <b>elongation</b> axis in both the inner and outer periclinal cell face in the elongation zone and root hair zone. CESA complexes predominantly move in rows along CMTs in both directions. Analysis of timelapse movies of CMTs revealed that the position shifting of cortical microtubules accounts for how the uniform layer of cellulose microfibrils can be formed. Chapter 5 is the general discussion of the thesis, where we provide a framework in which the results {{presented in}} the previous chapters fall.    ...|$|R
