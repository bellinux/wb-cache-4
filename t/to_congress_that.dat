5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> {{efforts at}} diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management of the State Department, and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department. Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark on a course for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E

25|$|Cartagena spent 20 {{years in}} the Army before {{retiring}} as a Sergeant First Class, in 1971. He continued to be an active figure around the 65th Infantry Headquarters in Puerto Rico long after his retirement. He also had family in El Paso, Texas. His family, upon learning of Modesto's actions, had taken {{it upon themselves to}} make a request <b>to</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> he be awarded the Medal of Honor. They received support on this quest from the Republican Veterans Committee. His supporters argued that the segregation policy of the army, at the time, and the limited English capacity of his company members when filling out the forms for the application, resulted in the awarding of the nations' second highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 1777, General Cornwallis with 4,000 British and Hessians {{attacked}} General Benjamin Lincoln's outpost at Bound Brook, New Jersey. In the Battle of Bound Brook, Cornwallis achieved surprise but his center attacked {{before his}} two wings were {{in position to}} cut off the Americans. Most of Lincoln's force evaded the planned envelopment, but the British claimed to have captured 70 of his men and three cannons. The British reported their losses as three killed and four wounded. Washington reported <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> Lieutenants William Ferguson and Charles Turnbull, 20 men, and two cannons from Proctor's Artillery Regiment were captured. In the armies' maneuverings {{at the start of the}} Philadelphia campaign, Washington ordered Proctor's Regiment to Trenton where it joined Brigadier General Francis Nash's North Carolina Brigade about 24 July 1777. Elements of the regiment were also withdrawn from Fort Island that day. On 22 August, Nash and Proctor were directed to move south to oppose Lieutenant General Sir William Howe's landing in Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

25|$|In 1787, Rutledge was {{selected}} to represent South Carolina in the Philadelphia Convention which was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, but instead produced the United States Constitution. He attended all the sessions and served on five committees. At the Convention, Rutledge maintained a moderate nationalist stance and chaired the Committee of Detail. After the Convention had debated the Virginia Plan and settled some major points of controversy, the Committee of Detail, which Rutledge chaired, assembled during the convention's July 4 recess. Though the committee did not record its minutes, {{it is known that}} the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, to produce the first full draft. Much of what was included in this draft consisted of details, such as powers given <b>to</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> hadn't been debated by the Convention. Most of these were uncontroversial and unchallenged, and as such much of what Rutledge's committee included in this first draft made it into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight. However, later financial analysis in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year. If the Ares I system were flown multiple times a year the marginal costs could have fallen to as low as $138 million per launch. In December 2011, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden testified <b>to</b> <b>congress</b> <b>that</b> the Ares I would cost $4–4.5 billion a year, and $1.6 billion per flight. The Ares I marginal cost was predicted {{to have been a}} fraction of the Shuttle's marginal costs even had it flown multiple times per year. By comparison, the cost of launching three astronauts on a manned Russian Soyuz is $153 million.|$|E
500|$|When a {{national}} rail strike threatened in May 1946, Truman seized the railroads.

500|$|Timeliness of {{care was}} an {{important}} goal to the VHA. In 1995, VHA established a goal of scheduling primary and specialty care medical appointments within 30 days to ensure veterans’ timely access to care. [...] VHA began collecting patients wait time data in 2000 for which the then-General Accounting Office (GAO) reported inaccuracies.

500|$|In {{order to}} {{emphasize}} <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> Illinois {{would be a}} free state, the legislature passed in January 1818 {{a bill that would}} both abolish Illinois' [...] "indentured servant" [...] system of de facto slavery, and prohibit Illinois' future Constitution from reinstating it. [...] Governor Edwards issued his only veto to send the bill back to the legislature, and it was never revised.

The Federal-Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974 established the bridge formula as law, along with the gross weight limit of [...] [...] Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 feet or more length between axle sets, and a maximum load of 105,500lbs.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{there were}} {{concerns}} over the fleet's capable lifespan. Several projects beyond the B-52, the Convair B-58 Hustler and North American XB-70 Valkyrie, had either been aborted or proved disappointing in light of changing requirements, which left the older B-52 as the main bomber {{as opposed to the}} planned successive aircraft models. On 19 February 1965, General Curtis E. LeMay testified <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> the lack of a follow-up bomber project to the B-52 raised the danger that, [...] "The B-52 is going to fall apart on us before we can get a replacement for it." [...] Other aircraft, such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, later complemented the B-52 in roles the aircraft was not as capable in, such as missions involving high-speed, low-level penetration dashes.|$|E
500|$|On {{taking office}} in January1961, Kennedy was {{informed}} that the missile gap was an illusion.

Kennedy Archives, 28 March 1961, pp.I-38. because it [...] "stood little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully." [...] Instead, Kennedy recommended [...] "the B-70 program be carried forward essentially to explore the problem of flying at three times {{the speed of sound}} with an airframe potentially useful as a bomber." [...] After Congress approved $290million of B-70 [...] "add-on" [...] funds to the President's 12 May 1960 modified FY 1961 budget, the Administration decided on a [...] "Planned Usage" [...] of only $100 million of these funds.
