If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E

5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful <b>they</b> <b>become.</b> <b>The</b> highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E

He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what {{else is going on}} in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on.

25|$|Chennault {{was able}} to recruit some 300 American pilots and ground crew, posing as tourists, who were adventurers or mercenaries, not {{necessarily}} idealists out to save China. But under Chennault they developed into a crack fighting unit, always going against superior Japanese forces. <b>They</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> symbol of America's military might in Asia. <b>They</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> Flying Tigers.|$|R

25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} before <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, {{it involves the}} selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methodsâ€”the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|E
25|$|The Jordanian Brotherhood {{has formed}} its own {{political}} party, the Islamic Action Front. In 1989 <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> largest group in parliament, with 23 out of 80 seats, and 9 other Islamist allies. A Brother {{was elected president}} of the National Assembly and the cabinet formed in January 1991 included several MBs. Its radicalization which calls for more militant support for Hamas in Palestine has come into direct conflict with its involvement in the parliament and overall political process. The Brotherhood claimed its acceptance of democracy and the democratic process but only within their own groups. There is a high degree of dissent amongst Brotherhood leaders who do not share the same values therefore undermining its acceptance and commitment to democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} Alexandra on 25 March 1921 caused a great {{relief to the}} Royal Family: {{under the terms of}} the Salic law (which prevailed in Greece), the newborn cannot claim the crown and she was {{unlikely}} to be used to undermine the dynasty. King Constantine I and Dowager Queen Olga therefore accepted easily that <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> godparents of the child. Still, neither the child nor her mother receive more official recognition; only in July 1922, and at the behest of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which allowed the King to retroactively recognize marriages of members of the Royal Family, although on a non-dynastic basis. With this legal subterfuge, Alexandra obtained the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Greece and Denmark. Aspasia's status, however, was not changed with the law and she remained a simple commoner to the eyes of protocol.|$|E

25|$|On {{a mission}} to rescue half-bloods Bianca and Nico di Angelo; Percy, Annabeth, Thalia and Grover are {{attacked}} by a manticore and rescued by the goddess Artemis and her Hunters. However, Annabeth falls off a cliff whilst trying to fight the manticore and {{is said to be}} captured. Later, Artemis is captured by Luke's army while on the hunt for the Ophiotaurus, a cow-serpent monster that was foretold to bring the downfall of Olympus when its entrails are sacrificed to a fire. Her lieutenant Zoe Nightshade, daughter of Atlas, leads Bianca, Thalia and Grover on a quest to save her. Percy, who was not invited to join the party, follows them on behalf of Nico Di Angelo, promising that he will do his best to protect his sister, Bianca. The others eventually find Percy, and he joins their group. <b>They</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> prey of skeletons, who chase them across the country. Bianca is able to kill one, which leaves the others mystified. Bianca later dies as they make their way across a godly junkyard. They find Annabeth with Luke and Artemis, who is holding up the sky. Percy then takes it from Artemis and they trick Atlas into his original position under the sky. Thalia replaces Zoe, who dies, as Artemis' lieutenant. Thalia's induction as a lieutenant of Artemis ensures that she will become immortal, never aging to 16, thus escaping the Great Prophecy and leaving Percy to fulfill it. They return to camp and Percy informs Nico about Bianca's death during the journey. Nico blames Percy for failing to protect her and runs away, only after killing skeletons that invade the camp, so that Percy realizes that Hades is Nico's father.|$|E
500|$|Through {{much of the}} 16th century, {{the chiefs}} of Ummattur in {{particular}} had carried on [...] "unceasing aggression" [...] against their neighbors, {{even in the face}} of punitive raids by the Vijayanagara armies. In the end, as a compromise, the son of a defeated Ummattur chief was appointed the viceroy at Seringapatam. The Wodeyars of Mysore too were eying surrounding land; by 1644, when the Wodeyars unseated the powerful Changalvas of Piriyapatna, not only had <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> dominant presence in the southern regions of what later became Mysore state, but the Vijayanagara empire was also on its last legs, having only a year's life left.

500|$|Existence {{resists the}} {{indifference}} {{of life and}} death, it lives beyond mechanical [...] "life," [...] it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thoughtâ€”which, for me, is {{the very thought of}} this film â€”is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> evidence of this thoughtâ€”and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
