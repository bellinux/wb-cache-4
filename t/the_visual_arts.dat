5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a diverse}} and growing {{cultural}} scene, with cultural life exhibited {{in a number}} of fields, including <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> <b>arts,</b> performing arts and nightlife. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Piața Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins. However, the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures, notably St. Michael's Church.|$|E

Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses {{by the end of}} their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.|$|E
5|$|Until {{his final}} years, Wagner's life was characterised by {{political}} exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced {{in many of the}} arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> and theatre.|$|E

The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.|$|E

The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E

5|$|From the {{unexpected}} realism {{of his first}} major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his World's Fair exhibit, and he kept company {{with a variety of}} high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, {{in the last year of}} both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified.

5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same hold of <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> <b>arts,</b> but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
