40|$|In this paper, a semi-empirical {{model of}} the rate of {{combustion}} of densified biomass briquettes is developed and presented. It takes into account selected physical properties; fuel geometry, density and moisture content. The effect {{of changes in the}} surface heating rate and air-flow rate on fuel devolatisation are investigated. It is found that the pyrolysis rate changes in proportion to small changes in the surface heating rate, and that the equivalence ratio correlates with air-flow rate <b>for</b> <b>briquettes</b> burning in a stove. These semi-analytical tools provide a means of calculating the devolatisation rate <b>for</b> <b>briquettes</b> burning in a stove and will be used in analytical models to explore the relationship between stove efficiency and emissions...|$|R

40|$|Jathropa seed {{waste is}} one of organic garbage that still has benefit value, one of the {{benefits}} is used <b>for</b> <b>briquette</b> produced. There are two kinds of jathropa seed waste, which are dreg and husks of jathropa seed. Dreg and husks of jathropa are suitable materials <b>for</b> <b>briquette</b> production because they have under 20 % of moisture content and high of carbon content. Whereas, rice husks {{is one of}} additional raw material <b>for</b> <b>briquette</b> production. The objectives of this research are to obtain the best briquette with raw materials variation composition and variation of binder content. The variation of raw material based on mass comparison are dreg: rice husk (20 : 80; 40 : 60; 80 : 20), dreg:husk (20 : 80; 40 : 60; 80 : 20), and husk rice husk (20 : 80; 40 : 60; 80 : 20). Briquette was made from pyrolysis process then the carbon result will be size reduced and screened. After process screening, carbon was mixed with binder then dried in the oven.

40|$|Where modern {{heating and}} cooking fuels for domestic, institutional, {{commercial}} and industrial use are not readily available, briquettes made from biomass residues could contribute to the sustainable supply of energy. This study reviews the briquette making process, looking at the entire value chain starting from the type and characteristics of feedstock used <b>for</b> <b>briquette</b> making to the potential market <b>for</b> <b>briquettes</b> in developing countries. It also analyzes the role that gender plays in briquette production. Depending on the raw materials used and technologies applied during production, fuel briquettes come in different qualities and dimensions, and thus require appropriate targeting of different market segments. Key drivers of success in briquette production and marketing include ensuring consistent supply of raw materials with good energy qualities, appropriate technologies, and consistency in the quality and supply of the briquettes. Creating strong partnerships with key stakeholders, such as the municipality, financiers and other actors within the briquette value chain, and enabling policy are important drivers {{for the success of}} briquette businesses...|$|R

40|$|Different {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of the mechanical durability (DU) of pellets and briquettes were compared by international round robin tests including different laboratories. The DUs of five briquette and 26 pellet types were determined. <b>For</b> <b>briquettes,</b> different rotation numbers of a prototype tumbler and a calculated DU index are compared. For pellets testing, the study compares two standard methods, a tumbling device according to ASAE S 269. 4, the Lignotester according to O¨ NORM M 7135 and a second tumbling method with a prototype tumbler. For the tested methods, the repeatability, the reproducibility and the required minimum number of replications to achieve given accuracy levels were calculated. Additionally, this study evaluates the relation between DU and particle density. The results show for both pellets and briquettes, that the measured DU values and their variability are influenced by the applied method. Moreover, the variability of the results depend on the biofuel itself. <b>For</b> <b>briquettes</b> of DU above 90 %, five replications lead to an accuracy of 2 %, while 39 replications are needed to achieve an accuracy of 10 %, when briquettes of DU below 90 % are tested. For pellets, the tumbling device described by the ASAE standard allows to reach acceptable accuracy levels (1 %) with a limited number of replications. Finally, for the tested pellets and briquettes no relation between DU and particle density was found. Peer reviewe...|$|R

It was proved that the briquettes volume density depends very much on the material which the briquettes are made from. Next influences (cutting method, chips size) are less meaningful. From {{the point of view of}} the relation between the destruction force and the briquetting pressure it was found that the resistance to crushing of briquettes made from copper alloys was minimal, the resistance to crushing of briquettes made from aluminium alloys was major and the resistance to crushing of briquettes made from zinc alloys was the highest...|$|R
