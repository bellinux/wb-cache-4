5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point <b>Trolley</b> to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated <b>trolley</b> station. In 1948, the <b>trolley</b> was discontinued because it duplicated another <b>trolley</b> along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). The <b>trolley</b> ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|E

50|$|Tourist <b>trolleys</b> {{are used}} by both {{municipal}} and private operators. Municipal operators may mix tourist <b>trolleys</b> in with the regular service bus fleet to add more visitor interest or attract attention to new routes. In many cities tourist <b>trolleys</b> are used as circulators. Tourist <b>trolleys</b> are also run by private operators to carry tourists to popular destinations.|$|R
5|$|As {{the city}} became {{increasingly}} congested further {{means of transportation}} were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse The <b>trolley</b> cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the <b>trolley</b> system seem like a burden.|$|E
5|$|Platform 9¾, {{from which}} the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a <b>trolley</b> {{apparently}} passing through the wall.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{settlement}} of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally bypassed the village to the north was relocated southward {{to go through the}} growing settlement. The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852. Modern NY175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather the length of a former <b>trolley</b> line that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga. This <b>trolley</b> line parallels the relocated alignment.|$|E

5000|$|His {{predecessor}} {{referred to}} the number of patients on <b>trolleys</b> as a [...] "national emergency". Shortly before becoming Minister for Health the number of patients on <b>trolleys</b> reached a new record high of 569. On taking office, James Reilly vowed that [...] "never again" [...] would we see 569 patients on <b>trolleys.</b> [...] The number of patients waiting on <b>trolleys</b> has been reduced by over a third since he became Minister for Health and is now at its lowest level in six years.|$|R

5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a <b>trolley.</b> White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the <b>trolley</b> into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its <b>trolley,</b> and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the <b>trolley</b> up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
5000|$|Laptop {{charging}} <b>trolleys,</b> {{also known}} as laptop <b>trolleys</b> or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple laptops, netbooks, and tablet computers at the same time. The <b>trolleys</b> are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs suites of desktop equipped with [...] "tower" [...] computers, but {{do not have enough}} plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices. The <b>trolleys</b> can be wheeled between rooms and classrooms so that all students and teachers in a particular building can access fully charged IT equipment.|$|R

5|$|The stage {{show at the}} semi-final {{included}} Dustin in his <b>trolley,</b> {{wearing a}} silver suit.

5|$|<b>Trolley</b> buses {{gradually}} made way for motor buses {{until the}} last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg tramline as a remnant of a once extensive light rail network. Except for the Glenelg Type H, the trams were sold or scrapped. Some were used as shacks, playrooms or preserved by museums.|$|E
5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo <b>trolley,</b> later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|E
50|$|Electric golf <b>trolleys</b> were {{introduced}} into the United Kingdom by Joe Catford who established the company Powakaddy in 1983. Having sold Powakaddy in the early 1990s, Catford went on to found HillBilly, another company specialising in electric golf <b>trolleys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fare mezzanines and {{staircases}} were reconfigured {{over the}} years as streetcars were replaced by trackless <b>trolleys</b> and later buses.
