500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Benzema {{switched}} to the number 9 shirt as Real Madrid were {{under the tutelage of}} new incoming manager José Mourinho. The striker immediately drew the ire of Mourinho who declared to reporters during a pre-season media session that [...] "Benzema must understand that he is extremely talented, but <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not enough", while also stating that [...] " [...] need a striker who is sparky, not one that is listless". Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was [...] "not used to working". Blanc also stated that the striker needed to shed weight in order to fulfill his potential.|$|E
500|$|In Revenge of the Sith, McDiarmid {{played a}} darker {{interpretation}} of the character. He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> very interesting, {{in the sense that}} you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power." [...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera." [...] McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello: ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of TV Blend {{was also}} {{critical}} of the episode, writing: [...] "I don't think based on the first episode that {{we can say that}} Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you'll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV noted that the special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom and one of the surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> heartbreaking enough." ...|$|E

500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> heartbreaking enough."

If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cricket of {{the period}} did feature {{numerous}} great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Frank Woolley, but <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not unique as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia [...] "needed someone to put a perspective on it".

60|$|Saton was not {{altogether}} at his ease. The brilliancy of his surroundings, the easy {{charm of the}} woman, were a little disconcerting.

60|$|Chauvelin {{listened to}} all these {{explanations}} with some impatience.

2500|$|The Court {{stressed}} that the new standard under Rule 702 was rooted in the judicial process and intended to be distinct and separate from the search for scientific truth. [...] "Scientific conclusions are subject to perpetual revision. Law, on the other hand, must resolve disputes finally and quickly.

2500|$|By USGA rules, {{handicap}} calculation first requires calculating a [...] "Handicap Differential" [...] {{for each}} round of play the player has completed by strict rules. <b>That</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> {{a function of}} the player's [...] "gross adjusted score" [...] (adjustments can be made to mitigate various deviations either from strict rules or from a player's normal capabilities, for handicap purposes only) and two course-specific difficulty ratings: the Course Rating, a calculated expected score for a hypothetical [...] "scratch golfer": and the Slope Rating, a number based on how much worse a hypothetical 20-handicap [...] "bogey golfer" [...] would score compared to the [...] "scratch golfer". The average Slope Rating of all USGA-rated courses as of 2012 is 113, which also factors into the Differential computation.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: When I finally met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch him and you couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by just looking at him play.|$|E

[...] While praising the iPhone 4S for being a [...] "snappy performer", he noted that [...] "When it comes to speed, iOS 6 doesn't feel terribly different from iOS 5". Craig Grannell of TechRadar wrote that [...] "iOS 6 is rather like the iPhone 5 or OS X Mountain Lion - the refinement of something that already works extremely well.

[...] Jason Parker of CNET wrote that [...] "iOS 6 is a welcome upgrade for any iOS user, but it's not going to completely change the way you use your device.

50|$|The Church of the Company of Jesus, (Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús) was a Jesuit church {{located in}} {{downtown}} Santiago.

60|$|Of these {{secondary}} fundamentals therefore, {{whatever is}} their number, this is one, even coming to God by Christ; for as in p. 7 and 9 he calleth it a positive precept, a thing <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> neither good nor evil; so here {{he speaks of}} such as are not in their own nature holy; not such, as that holiness is not in some degree or other attainable without the belief of them.|$|E

6000|$|First. If thou wouldest grow in this {{grace of}} fear, take heed of A HARD HEART, for that will hinder thy growth in this grace. [...] "Why hast thou {{hardened}} our heart from thy fear?"

A hard heart is but barren ground for any grace to grow in, especially for the grace of fear: there is but little of this fear where the heart is indeed hard; neither will there ever be much therein.|$|E

If {{going to}} God by Christ, be in itself but an {{indifferent}} thing, then, as I also hinted before, {{it is not}} of the substance of Christianity; but a man may be truly a Christian without it; may be saved, and go to heaven without it; this is in truth the consequence of your words: for things purely of an indifferent nature, do not in themselves either make or mar the righteousness that justifieth us from the curse before God. Wherefore, by your argument, if a man remain ignorant of that positive precept, of 'coming to God by Christ'; he remaineth ignorant but of an indifferent thing, a thing <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> neither good nor evil, and therefore not essentially material to his faith or justifying righteousness.|$|E
