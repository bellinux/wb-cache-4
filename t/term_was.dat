5|$|Pierce {{departed}} in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., {{where the}} Twenty-third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second <b>term</b> <b>was</b> under way, and the House {{had a strong}} Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements {{the responsibility of the}} states. Pierce's first <b>term</b> <b>was</b> fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835.
