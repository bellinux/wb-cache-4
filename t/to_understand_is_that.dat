2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for {{not doing}} more to support dissidents in {{communist}} Cuba. American officials were irked {{by the fact that}} Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. [...] "There is no secret that we have had differences with Spain on a number of issues, but we have also had very good cooperation with Spain on a number of issues", Rice remarked. Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. What we hope is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba. And what the U.S. has <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> given they have no relations with Cuba, they should trust in a faithful, solid ally like Spain."

2500|$|Representatives Ed Royce, the {{chairman}} of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Eliot Engel, members of different parties released a statement that read:The decision by the Egyptian military to take state authority {{out of the hands of}} the ruling Muslim Brotherhood government marks another sharp turning point in Egypt's incomplete revolution. [...] What the Brotherhood neglected <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> democracy means more than simply holding elections. [...] Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law. [...] Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat. [...] As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule. [...] We are encouraged that a broad cross-section of Egyptians will gather to rewrite the constitution. [...] All parties in Egypt must show restraint, prevent violence, and prepare to be productive players in the future democratic Egypt. [...] We encourage the military to exercise extreme caution moving forward and support sound democratic institutions through which the people and future governments can flourish.|$|E
