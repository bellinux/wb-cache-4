25|$|The {{reason for}} Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines to be {{constructed}} together was {{the belief that}} kami, like humans, needed salvation {{through the power of}} Buddha. Kami were then thought to be subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how that the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through Buddhist rites and the reading of sūtras, the monk would build a temple next to the kami's shrine. Such groupings were created already in the 7th century, for example in Usa, Kyūshū, where kami Hachiman was worshiped together with Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya) at Usa Hachiman-gū. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had been open-air sites became Buddhist style groupings of buildings.|$|E
