25|$|In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) {{that the}} USA would support Britain’s “strategic, {{political}} and economic position in the Middle East”. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that “the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> wise” (he {{was referring to the}} Schuman Plan to set up the European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was “different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them”.|$|E

Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was going to be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{experiment}} with core processes within software development tasks (reuse and conflict management in requirements engineering). After defining those processes, we automatically perform 100, 000 s of manipulations {{in accordance with}} that process. The results of the ma-nipulations are summarized and discussed. In two case studies with this technique we find that building widely reusable software components will be harder <b>than</b> <b>we</b> had <b>thought</b> while resolving conflicts amongst competing stakeholders is easier <b>than</b> <b>we</b> had <b>thought...</b>|$|R

500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|The International Cricket Council (ICC), {{responsible}} for running the game worldwide, conducted {{a trial in}} 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased {{the frequency with which}} umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: [...] "Umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they might, I suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out. I think if we're totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would." ...|$|E

White later announced that the first single from the new album would be called [...] "Die By The Drop", for which he would sing lead vocals.

2500|$|That {{the oceans}} warmed {{in the past}} {{significantly}} faster <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> would imply {{that the effects of}} climate change could be worse than currently expected, placing the planet's sensitivity to [...] toward the higher end of its possible range.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, U.S. {{federal judge}} Kimba Wood {{released}} $13.4 million in frozen assets belonging to Sudan {{to be awarded}} to 33 spouses, parents, and children of the sailors killed in the attack. The money was awarded based on the 2002 Terrorism Risk Insurance Act and spearheaded by Miami Attorney Andrew C. Hall. Previously, the court had found Sudan culpable in facilitating {{the attack on the}} destroyer. Said John Clodfelter, father of Kenneth Clodfelter who was killed in the bombing, [...] "It's about time something was done. It's taken so much more time <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it should take." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though In/Casino/Out was {{recorded}} live, [...] "Relationship of Command {{may very well}} be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI's live performance." [...] "Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us," [...] Bixler recalls. [...] "We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we could go. I learned to cut loose the way we do live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever." [...] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including [...] "Rolodex Propaganda", [...] "Non-Zero Possibility", and [...] "Invalid Litter Dept."

5000|$|In video {{statements}} {{released in}} October 2010, Gakayev, Vadalov and Gaziyev explained their motives for breaking away from Umarov, with Gaziyev noting that [...] "there {{is no one}} who has been at his side longer <b>than</b> <b>we</b> have, or who knows him better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> do.... <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> about this for a long time, we prayed to Allah so as not to destroy the accord among fighters." [...] Gaziyev would also define the goals of the Chechen nationalists as [...] "cleansing our country of the enemies of Allah, establishing Sharia law to defend the poor and disadvantaged, and bringing up our future generation in the Muslim faith." ...|$|R
5000|$|For customers, service {{guarantees}} play {{an important}} role in alleviating perceived risks of the purchase. The guarantees also facilitate more ease and more likelihood for customers to complain, since they expect the front-line staff to be ready with resolutions and appropriate compensations. From companies’ perspectives, according to the vice President of Hampton Inn, “Designing the guarantee made us understand what made guests satisfied, rather <b>than</b> what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> made them satisfied.” ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the new facts concernig the sculptures by Matthias Bernard Braun (1684 – 1738) in Kuks. In {{addition}} to a new assessment of the Eight Beatitudes outside the hospital chapel, the article deals with Braun’s relation to the ancient sculpture and the artistic buzz in the Baroque Vienna. These two artistic phenomena infl uenced the sculptor’s work more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> have <b>thought</b> so far...|$|R
2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we would do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman {{does not have a}} main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alex Henderson states: [...] "predictability isn't {{a problem on}} <b>We</b> <b>Thought</b> About Duke, a {{cerebral}} post-bop date that trumpeter/flugelhornist Franz Koglmann co-led with alto sax master Lee Konitz. This is definitely {{one of the more}} daring Ellington tributes {{that came out of the}} '90s. Instead of inundating us with standards that we've heard time and time again ... Koglmann's arrangements have strong classical/chamber music leanings, and his admiration for Gil Evans is evident. For those seeking an Ellington tribute that is adventurous rather <b>than</b> conventional, <b>We</b> <b>Thought</b> About Duke is highly recommended".|$|R

40|$|A {{theory with}} such a {{mathematical}} beauty cannot be wrong: {{this was one of}} the main arguments in favor of string theory, which unifies all known physical theories of fundamental interactions in a single coherent description of the universe. But no one has ever observed strings, not even indirectly, neither the space of extra dimensions where they live. However, there is a hope that the ‘hidden’ dimensions of string theory are much larger <b>than</b> what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> in the past and they become within experimental reach in the near future, together with the strings themselves...|$|R
