A group of ophthalmologists and researchers rated the severity of 86 common ocular emergencies using a Delphi consensus method. The ratings were attributed on a 7 -point scale throughout a first-round survey. Then, the experts were provided with the median and quartiles of the ratings of each item to reevaluate the severity levels being aware of the group’s first-round responses. The final severity rating for each item corresponded to the median rating provided by the last Delphi round. Results.

The severity ranged from subconjunctival hemorrhages (median = 1, Q 1 = 0; Q 3 = 1) to penetrating eye injuries collapsing the eyeball with intraocular foreign body or panophthalmitis with infection following surgery (median = 5, Q 1 = 5; Q 3 = 6).

40|$|Objective To {{gain more}} insight into {{exclusion}} mechanisms and inclusion strategies in patient–expert partnerships. Background Patient participation in health research, {{on the level}} of ‘partnerships with experts’ is a growing phenomenon. However, little research is conducted whether exclusion mechanisms take place and to what extent patients’ perspectives are included in the final outcomes of these partnerships. Case study A dialogue meeting attended by experts, patients and patient representatives to develop a joint research agenda. Different inclusion strategies were applied during the dialogue meeting to avoid possible exclusion. Method Data were collected by the means of audio and video recordings, observations, document analysis and evaluative interviews. The data are clustered using a framework that divides exclusion mechanisms in three categories: circumstances, behaviour and verbal communication. The data are analysed focusing on the experiences of participants, observation of occurrence of exclusion and difference between input and outcome of the dialogue meeting. Results The circumstances of the dialogue and the behaviour of the participants were experienced as mainly inclusive. Some exclusion was observed particularly with respect to verbal communication. The input of the patients was less visible in the outcome of the dialogue meeting compared to the input of <b>the</b> <b>experts.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> This case study reveals that exclusion of patients’ perspective occurred during a dialogue meeting with experts, despite the fact that inclusion strategies were used and patients experienced the dialogue meeting as inclusive. To realize a more effective patient–expert partnership, more attention should be paid to the application of some additional inclusion strategies...|$|E

Relationship between the complex parameter and market price of best-selling products in a given category forms a current “profile” of state of the art, including maximum possible value (e. g. for military systems) as an extreme case.

Methods A search of the World Wide Web was made by a lay person to identify sites containing information on the treatment of cervical cancer. The credibility and accuracy of these sites was assessed using predefined criteria based on 'Criteria for Assessing the Quality of Health Information on the Internet' and accepted guidelines for the treatment of cervical cancer.

Objective To find out whether the Denver II instrument and DQ values can be used in the management of children with ASD andADHD. Methods A study was carried out on cases of children with ASD, multisystem development disorder (MSDD), pervasive development disorder - n ot otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), consisting of history taking, physical examination, establishing diagnosis, therapy, evaluation, and follow-up.

The key and, in the author's opinion, {{the most}} {{interesting}} questions of the qualification of intentional crimes for life and health are determined in a strategic way based {{on the study of}} scientific literature and materials of judicial practice, as well as monitoring of contemporary reality. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the problems of redundancy and the gap in the criminal law in this area, as well as the difficulties in applying the relevant norms, taking into account the recommendations of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The methodological basis of the work is dialectical-materialistic, logical, historical, systemstructural, as well as comparative-legal and concrete sociological methods. The main results and scope of it’s application. It is proposed to decriminalize the beatings provided for in Art. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, with the introduction of appropriate changes to the version of Article 116. 1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. The problem of an absolute gap in the field of criminal and legal protection of the individual from new types of causing death and involving minors in a suicidal behavior pattern, including using the Internet, is being raised. A draft of Federal Law No. 118634 - 7, submitted by I. A. Yarovaya in March 2017, is overviewed and practical recommendations for improving the criminal legislation of Russia are formulated.
