40|$|The {{steady-state}} calcium {{dependence of}} inactivation of calcium {{release from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied in voltage-clamped, cut segments of frog skeletal muscle fibers containing two calcium indicators, fura- 2 and anti-pyrylazo III (AP III). Fura- 2 fluorescence was used to monitor resting calcium and relatively small calcium transients during small depolarizations. AP III absorbance signals were used to monitor larger calcium transients during larger depolarizations. The rate of release (Rrel) of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was calculated from the calcium transients. The equilibrium calcium dependence of inactivation of calcium release was determined using 200 -ms prepulses of various amplitudes to elevate [Ca 2 +] to various steady levels. Each prepulse {{was followed by a}} constant <b>test</b> <b>pulse.</b> The suppression of peak Rrel during the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> provided a measure of the extent of inactivation of release {{at the end of the}} prepulse. The [Ca 2 +] dependence of inactivation indicated that binding of more than one calcium ion was required to inactivate each release channel. Half-maximal inactivation was produced at a [Ca 2 +] of approximately 0. 3 microM. Variation of the prepulse duration and amplitude showed that the suppression of peak release was consistent with calcium-dependent inactivation of calcium release but not with calcium depletion. The same calcium dependence of inactivation was obtained using different amplitude <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> to determine the degree of inactivation. Prepulses that produced near maximal inactivation of release during the following <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> produced <b>no</b> suppression of intramembrane charge movement during the <b>test</b> <b>pulse,</b> indicating that inactivation occurred at a step beyond the voltage sensor for calcium release. Three alternative set of properties that were assumed for the rapidly equilibrating calcium-binding sites intrinsic to the fibers gave somewhat different Rrel records, but gave very similar calcium dependence of inactivation. Thus, equilibrium inactivation of calcium release appears to be produced by rather modest increases in [Ca 2 +] above the resting level and in a steeply calcium-dependent manner. However, the inactivation develops relatively slowly even during marked elevation of [Ca 2 +], indicating that a calcium-independent transition appears to occur after the initial calcium-binding step...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} two methods to measure Ca 2 + channel inactivation in Lymnaea neurons—one method, {{based upon the}} conventional double-pulse protocol, uses currents during a moderately large depolarizing pulse, and the other uses tail currents after a very strong activating pulse. Both methods avoid contamination by proton currents and are unaffected by rundown of Ca 2 + current. The magnitude of inactivation measured differs for the two methods; this difference arises because the measurement of inactivation is inherently dependent upon the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> voltage used to monitor the Ca 2 + channel conductance. We discuss two models that can generate such <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence of inactivation measurements—a two-channel model and a two-open-state model. The first model accounts for this by assuming the existence of two types of Ca 2 + channels, different proportions of which are activated by the different <b>test</b> <b>pulses.</b> The second model assumes only one Ca 2 + channel type, with two closed and open states; in this model, the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence {{is due to the}} differential activation of channels in the two closed states by the <b>test</b> <b>pulses.</b> Test pulse dependence of inactivation measurements of Ca 2 + channels may be a general phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{subthreshold}} depolarization on mechanical threshold {{was investigated in}} tetrodotoxin-poisoned mammalian and amphibian skeletal muscle fibers using a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Mechanical threshold was determined with a 2 -ms <b>test</b> <b>pulse.</b> The immediate effect of depolarization was inhibition of the mechanical system. The consequent increase in the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold was linearly related {{to the size of}} the depolarization and there was, on the average, a 10 % increase in threshold for a 10 -mV depolarization in mammalian fibers. The duration of the inhibitory period was also related {{to the size of the}} depolarization. Inhibition was interrupted by the onset of activation (seen as a reduction in the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold), and in rat soleus fibers this occurred within 100 ms with a 20 -mV depolarization, inhibition decayed within 10 ms. The decay of activation after brief conditioning pulses was initially rapid (on the average, the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold recovered to 80 % of its control value within 1 ms) and then slow (full recovery took 100 - 500 ms). After long conditioning pulses, activation often decayed into a period of inhibition. When depolarization (of 20 mV or more) was maintained for several seconds, the fibers became inactivated.

40|$|The motion {{states of}} a salient-pole permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating {{at low speed}} are often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency test signals.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} on Myxicola giant axons {{to determine if the}} sodium activation and inactivation processes are coupled or independent. The main experimental approach was {{to examine the effects of}} changing <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> on steady-state inactivation curves.

40|$|Applying a brief repolarizing pre-pulse to a depolarized frog {{skeletal}} muscle fiber restores {{a small fraction}} of the transverse tubule membrane voltage sensors from the inactivated state. During a subsequent depolarizing <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> we detected brief, highly localized elevations of myoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration (Ca 2 + “sparks”) initiated by restored voltage sensors in individual triads at all <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> voltages. The latency histogram of these events gives the gating pattern of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release channels controlled by the restored voltage sensors. Both event frequency and clustering of events near the start of the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> increase with <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> depolarization. The macroscopic SR calcium release waveform, obtained from the spark latency histogram and the estimated open time of the channel or channels underlying a spark, exhibits an early peak and rapid marked decline during large depolarizations. For smaller depolarizations, the release waveform exhibits a smaller peak and a slower decline. However, the mean use time and mean amplitude of the individual sparks are quite similar at all test depolarizations and at all times during a given depolarization, indicating that the channel open times and conductances underlying sparks are essentially independent of voltage. Thus, the voltage dependence of SR Ca 2 + release is due to changes in the frequency and pattern of occurrence of individual, voltage-independent, discrete release events...|$|R

The rate of calcium release (Rrel) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) {{and changes in}} SR permeability to Ca 2 + (PSR) were calculated from measured changes in intracellular calcium concentration. Calcium release during a prepulse attenuated the inactivating component of PSR of the subsequent <b>test</b> <b>pulse.</b> The suppression was graded, larger release causing greater suppression, as expected from a calcium-dependent inactivation process. However, if the dissociation constant of the putative inhibitory calcium binding site (Kd) was estimated using different <b>test</b> <b>pulses</b> different affinities were obtained: a smaller <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> yielded a smaller Kd. Comparing {{the suppression of the}} inactivatable component of PSR during the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> (suppression) with the inactivatable component during the prepulse (pre-inactivation) revealed a linear relationship with a regression coefficient close to unity.

This {{study focused on}} the effects of a presynaptic calcium-activated potassium conductance, gK~c~, on the transmitter release evoked by single and paired depolarizing current pulses. Blocking gK~c~) by adding tetraethylammonium ion (TEA; 5 - 20 mM) to a solution containing tetrodotoxin and aminopyridines caused the relation between presynaptic potential and transmitter release to steepen and shift to less depolarized potentials. When two depolarizing current pulses were applied at 20 -ms intervals with g~c ~ not blocked, the presynaptic voltage change to the second (<b>test)</b> <b>pulse</b> was inversely related to the amplitude of the first (conditioning) pulse.

Changes in membrane current could be measured 30 microseconds after the initiation of the <b>test</b> <b>pulse.</b> Currents through Ca channels were recorded under conditions that eliminate Na and K currents. Tail currents, associated with Ca channel closing, decayed in two distinct phases that were very well fitted by the sum of two exponentials. The time constants tau f and tau s were near 160 microseconds and 1. 5 ms at - 80 mV, 20 degrees C. The tail current components, called FD and SD (fast-deactivating and slowly deactivating), are Ca channel currents.

It was suppressed when the cell was held at membrane potentials positive to - 50 mV and was blocked by 100 - 200 microM Ni 2 +.
