25|$|Nr I {{were the}} first type of {{articulated}} tram operated by the HKL. The design of the Nr I type trams {{was based on the}} GT6 type trams built by Düwag for various cities in western Europe since 1956, but the Nr I incorporated several technological innovations that had not been available when the GT6 was designed. The Nr I trams were delivered by Valmet between 1973 and 1975, with the first seven trams delivered in 1973, further 18 delivered in 1974 and the final 15 in 1975. As the first mass-produced tram type in the world, the Nr I featured <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper</b> control. The first tram of this class entered revenue-earning service on 16 December 1973 on line 10. Although the trams of this type are numbered 31 to 70, the first unit was not the 31st tram to be used by the HKL. The HKL tram numbering system had been reset in 1959, with the numbering of new trams delivered that year beginning from 1.|$|E

40|$|The battery {{electric}} vehicle {{is presented as a}} pollution free alternative to the internal combustion engined vehicle as a form of commuter transport in city centres. To conserve battery energy as much as possible, an efficient drive system, consisting of a chopper controller and a permanent magnet motor, is described and tested in four modes of operation - two modes of motoring and two of regenerative braking. From the experimental results, it was estimated that approximately 10 % of the energy expended by the vehicle during motoring could be returned to the battery if regenerative braking is employed under stop-start driving conditions. The operation of transistor and <b>thyristor</b> <b>choppers</b> is described, and their suitability for use in a vehicle drive system is discussed. A proposed vehicle control system, incorporating a thyristor array and associated logic for implementing the mode selection, is described and evaluated...|$|R

5000|$|Advancements in {{technology}} saw a <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper</b> system fitted {{to the next}} batch of power cars, coded DJM. The chopper cars gave a smoother and quieter ride. The chopper cars can be distinguished from the earlier camshaft cars by a large open grille at the pantograph end of the power car, and by different hatch coverings over the driver's side of the power car. DJM 8123-8137 had even larger open grilles on the pantograph end. DJM 8101 had its Candy livery moulded fibreglass end repainted into CityRail blue and yellow in 1990 to form a special set, with the commemorative wording [...] "celebrating 20 years of double-deck intercity services to Gosford" [...] applied near the driver's cab window. In 2009 DJM 8101's front was repainted into standard Intercity livery.|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} cost and {{maintenance}} the polyphase induction motor has advantages compared with its direct current counterpart, but {{the control of}} the output torque and speed is more involved. The advent of high power thyristors has allowed a new appraisal of the induction motor for variable speed drives (e. g. winches, cranes, and traction), and some of the well established, but inefficient methods (in terms of cost, control, and power consumption) have been given a new look. This thesis compares some of these methods of control, namely variable frequency, stator voltage, and rotor control and suggests a combination of stator voltage and rotor control to increase the versatility of the machine and to extend the torque/speed envelope of operation without the complexity of a fall inverter system. It is shown that the harmonics produced by a square wave inverter output can be reduced by increasing the number of pulses per half cycle output if the individual pulses have a given relationship. The influence of this harmonic reduction in the output of the inverter fed induction motor is investigated. An equivalent circuit is developed to represent the induction motor when fed with voltage waveforms of high harmonic content. This equivalent circuit is solved using a finite difference technique and is shown to give first order results with a variety of voltage waveforms. First order performance predictions are shown to be possible of an induction motor system, stator fed from a three phase alternating current supply via "back-to-back" pairs of thyristors using a simple chart method. The chart in this method gives a "derated" value of current available from the production of output torque, based on the uncontrolled theoretical performance of the motor and the given firing angle of the thyristors and the power factor of the motor at the given speed. The prediction of the performance of an induction motor with a <b>thyristor</b> direct current <b>chopper</b> in the rotor circuits in both the motoring and braking regions is achieved using the concept of an effective rotor resistance. The procedure for the calculation of this resistance from given parameters of known values is given, and the theoretical performance compared with that of an experimental system...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method of}} controlling a slip-ring induction motor so as to provide characteristics suitable for hoist drive applications. The primary of the machine was supplied from a three-phase voltage regulator which in addition to producing a motoring torque can also provide plug braking by phase reversal and dynamic braking by d. c. injection. The hoist drive characteristics are of a constant torque nature and these were obtained by the control of a variable duty cycle forced commutated <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper</b> in the secondary circuit of the motor. The operation of the voltage regulator has been examined for a load consisting of a delta wound induction motor. A simple model of the regulator has been developed from which speed-torque characteristics have been determined. Analysis of {{the operation of the}} motor and <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper</b> was used to determine the appropriate relationship between duty cycle and speed necessary to produce a constant torque characteristic. This relationship was realized by a function generator which was used to control the <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper.</b> Closed loop control of motor speed by the voltage regulator combined with open loop operation of the <b>thyristor</b> <b>chopper</b> as a function of speed gave the required constant torque characteristic. Logic circuits were incorporated in the design to allow automatic selection of the motoring and braking modes. The four-quadrant controller has been designed and successfully operated throughout the required speed range. The operation of the controller has been considered from both steady state and dynamic aspects...|$|E
