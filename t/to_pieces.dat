5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went <b>to</b> <b>pieces</b> on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

Despite numerous attempts by local city and crown officials to halt this, Redhead continued to cause considerable damage before being forced to stop. Proposals were made to pull down Clifford's Tower altogether in 1596, but were turned down because of the strength of local feeling.|$|E

Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda.

5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town.

The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut <b>to</b> <b>pieces.</b> When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Built on {{a shallow}} slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis {{stands on a}} ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Xuman). It overlooks a rolling fertile plain north of the modern city of Meknes.

By the third century BC, the Phoenicians had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language. The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Berber word Walilt, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, in {{this fight}} with others of his small {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against two of the crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry.

While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut <b>to</b> <b>pieces,</b> it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E
