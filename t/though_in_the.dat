5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one was a more modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building <b>though,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{consider this}} one of the earliest, and most deadly, biological attacks in world history, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end the Mongols were forced to retreat. Early sources state that the plague began its spread in the spring of 1346 at the River Don near the Black Sea, then spread throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and the Genovese provinces within the year.|$|E

5|$|Part of modern-day NY311 {{from the}} NY292 {{intersection}} to the route's ending terminus was {{once part of}} the Philipstown Turnpike. Initially, the county's proximity to the Hudson River supplied cheap means of transporting goods to Albany and New York City, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter months, the river froze over.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Posada was {{a turning}} point in Hungarian-Wallachian relations: <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the 14th century, the kings of Hungary still tried to {{regulate}} the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time, but they could only succeed temporarily. Thus Basarab's victory irretrievably opened the way to independence for the Principality of Wallachia.|$|E
5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 {{forced the}} zoo to close {{to protect the}} animals from {{possible}} infection. Since the zoo could not welcome any visitors, it faced significant financial losses. Questions were posed about the zoo's future, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end the park was able to reopen after only five weeks. Further help {{came in the form}} of a £1.9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of the city in early April, just as the zoo reopened.|$|E

5|$|The navy base became {{run down}} after the war, {{eventually}} closing in 1957. The {{problem of a}} declining population was significant in the post-war years, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in Orkney focused on growing prosperity {{and the emergence of}} a relatively classless society. Orkney was rated as the best place to live in Scotland in both 2013 and 2014 according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey.|$|E
5|$|The road makes several {{appearances}} in literature. In Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, the titular character {{runs down the}} road trying to escape from London to Dover, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. After suffering an attack of amnesia, the main character of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter, Dorothy Hare, finds herself alone on Old Kent Road. In 1985, the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road.|$|E
5|$|Vowel {{letters are}} also grouped in pairs—of unrounded and rounded vowel sounds—with these pairs also {{arranged}} from front {{on the left}} to back on the right, and from maximal closure at top to minimal closure at bottom. No vowel letters are omitted from the chart, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past some of the mid central vowels were listed among the 'other symbols'.|$|E

Most of the English gains were negated when, months later, the English governors of Deventer and Zutphen's sconce defected to the Spanish ranks and handed over their places to Farnese.|$|E
5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note <b>though,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was sent off after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. It also meant that he went down in history as only the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E
5|$|As Kishimoto {{originally}} planned Akatsuki to be {{a group of}} individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Shippuden anime both halves are voiced by Travis Willingham.|$|E

5|$|In Smallville, Lana is {{the love}} {{interest}} for Clark Kent, <b>though,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first season she is dating Whitney Fordman. By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grew closer to Lex Luthor. Eventually, Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together. After stealing a kryptonite-powered suit from Lex, Lana absorbs {{an enormous amount of}} kryptonite radiation, which prohibits her from getting too close to Clark, and she leaves Smallville for good, but vowed to continue to use her powers to preserve life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} an Atlantic {{hurricane}} threatens the northern coast of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines nine locations as tropical cyclone warning breakpoints. The westernmost is {{the border between}} Panama and Colombia, and the easternmost is Georgetown, Guyana, located at 6.82° N. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning breakpoints extend eastward to the border of Panama and Colombia at 7.23° N. No Atlantic hurricane has existed south of 6.82° N, and no Pacific hurricane has existed east of 80° W, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event a tropical cyclone threatens a region of South America without warnings, additional warning sites can be selected. In addition to warnings on the mainland of South America, the National Hurricane Center defines the entire island of San Andres as a tropical cyclone warning breakpoint.|$|E
5|$|NFL postseason {{history can}} be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches that needed to be held to break ties in the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E

5|$|No.5 SFTS {{reached a}} {{strength}} of some 2,000 personnel during the war, and graduated 1,515 pilots. The rate of flying {{conducted at the}} school declined during 1945 and, by November, its aircraft were being readied for storage. In February 1946, No.5 SFTS was disbanded and its staff and equipment used to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), which had operated during the war as No.1 Service Flying Training School prior to disbanding in 1944. No.1 FTS was allocated 55 Wirraways, two de Havilland Tiger Moths, and one Avro Anson, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event it undertook little flying before relocating to Point Cook in August 1947. Post-war demobilisation saw the establishment of several RAAF Care and Maintenance Units (CMU), which {{were responsible for the}} upkeep of surplus equipment prior to disposal. No.5 SFTS spawned Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty to look after aircraft stored at the base. These were auctioned off in November 1948, and CMU Uranquinty was dissolved the next month.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, <b>though</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E
