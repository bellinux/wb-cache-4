5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created the suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, <b>to</b> <b>sweat</b> profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E
5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery would begin <b>to</b> <b>sweat</b> profusely. After {{one to two}} hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability <b>to</b> <b>sweat,</b> with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E

5000|$|Gustatory <b>sweating</b> refers <b>to</b> thermal <b>sweating</b> {{induced by}} the {{ingestion}} of food. The increase in metabolism caused by ingestion raises body temperature, leading <b>to</b> thermal <b>sweating.</b> Hot and spicy foods also leads <b>to</b> mild gustatory <b>sweating</b> in the face, scalp and neck: capsaicin (the compound that makes spicy food taste [...] "hot"), binds to receptors in the mouth that detect warmth. The increased stimulation of such receptors induces a thermoregulatory response.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} purification {{element to}} the ancient Maya was the sweat bath, or 'temezcal. Similar to a modern-day sauna, sweat baths were constructed of stone walls and ceilings, with a small opening {{in the top of}} the ceiling. Water poured onto the hot rocks in the room created steam, offering a setting in which <b>to</b> <b>sweat</b> out impurities. Sweat baths were used for a range of conditions and situations. New mothers who had recently conceived a child would seek revitalization in them, while individuals who were sick could find healing power in sweating.|$|E
25|$|Gaur, {{also known}} as the Indian bison, is the {{heaviest}} and most powerful of all wild cattle native to South and Southeast Asia. It is indicated in field data that the population of mature animals is about 5,200–18,000. Male and female Gaur both have distinctive humps between the head and shoulders, a dorsal ridge, prominent horns, and a dewlap which extends to the front legs.The Gaur grows 60% faster than domestic cattle, meaning farmers meat can be harvested at a faster rate, making beef production two to three times more profitable. Gaur meat is preferred over other breeds' meat among local people. Another benefit of the bovine is that it has the ability <b>to</b> <b>sweat</b> and tolerates heat well.|$|E
25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due <b>to</b> <b>sweat</b> and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E

40|$|Background. Sweat is an {{aggravating}} factor in atopic dermatitis (AD), regardless of age. Sweat allergy {{may be involved}} in AD aggravated by sweating. Objective. We investigated whether sweat exacerbates adult AD symptoms and examined the extent of sweat allergy’s involvement. Method. We asked 34 AD patients (17 men, 17 women; mean age: 27. 8 years) to record the extent <b>to</b> which <b>sweat</b> aggravated their symptoms on a 10 -point numerical scale. Participant responses were compared with histamine release tests (HRT). Furthermore, 24 of the patients received instructions on methods of sweat management, and their outcomes were evaluated on a 10 -point scale. Results. Sweat HRT results were class ≥ 2 in 13 patients, but HRT results were not correlated with the patients’ self-assessments of symptom aggravation by sweat. One month after receiving sweat management instructions, a low mean score of 4. 6 was obtained regarding whether active sweating was good, but a high mean score of 7. 0 was obtained in response <b>to</b> whether the <b>sweat</b> management instructions had been helpful. Conclusion. Our investigation showed that patients’ negative impressions of sweat might derive from crude personal experiences that are typically linked <b>to</b> <b>sweating.</b> Sweat management for patients with adult atopic dermatitis was extremely useful regardless of sweat allergy...|$|R
