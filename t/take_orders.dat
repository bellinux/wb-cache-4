5|$|There {{are five}} campaigns in The Age of Kings, {{containing}} historically based scenarios such as Genghis Khan's invasion of Eurasia, Barbarossa's Crusade, or Saladin's defence of the Holy Land.

5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E

5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
25|$|The {{period from}} March to December 2006 {{was marked by}} {{tensions}} when Palestinian Authority commanders affiliated to Fatah refused to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government.

25|$|These {{included}} excluding Africans {{from the}} West African Medical Service {{and saying that}} no European should <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from an African, which {{had the effect of}} ruling out African doctors from serving with the army.

25|$|General Lovell {{tried to}} reduce command {{confusion}} by ordering that all vessels afloat should likewise <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Commander Mitchell. However, Captain John A.

25|$|The Belgian Revolution was {{not well}} {{supported}} in Flanders and even on 4 October 1830, when the Belgian independence was eventually declared, Flemish authorities refused to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from the new Belgian government in Brussels.

25|$|Willoughby's {{relations}} with the Parliamentarians began to fray in 1644. In March he joined with Sir John Meldrum in the assault on Newark, the failure {{of which has been}} partially attributed to Willoughby's supposed unwillingness to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Meldrum. Willoughby quarrelled with Manchester and was forced to make an apology to the House of Lords as a result. Furthermore, Cromwell himself saw fit to complain about the conduct of Willoughby's soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Sir John French’s {{orders from}} Kitchener were to {{cooperate}} with the French but not to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from them. Given that the tiny BEF (about 100,000 men, half of them serving regulars and half reservists) was Britain’s only field army, Lord Kitchener also instructed French to avoid undue losses and exposure to “forward movements where large numbers of French troops are not engaged” until Kitchener himself had had a chance to discuss the matter with the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|The exact size of {{the army}} under Muhammad's command is not {{explicitly}} stated, but it was likely much greater than al-Mu'tazz's forces. As many of his units were irregulars, however, their conduct in battle was not always reliable, and they were disciplined often for their failure to follow orders. In addition, while many army commanders were willing to pledge themselves to al-Musta'in's cause, {{not all of them}} were willing to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Muhammad; there are multiple instances of pro-Musta'in regiments outside Baghdad acting independently and engaging the Turks on their own initiative.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of general}} merchants as the {{middlemen}} {{in the sale}} of Harris Tweed was a vital factor in expanding the industry away from the patronage of the land-owning gentry and into the hands of island entrepreneurs. Those merchants who built up a business dealing in tweeds often became independent producers in their own right. They would <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> for Harris Tweed, send the yarn to their chosen weavers, take back the tweeds for finishing, either locally by hand, or later by some mainland finishing company and finally dispatch the tweed to the customer.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 2007, at AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Eclipse {{unveiled}} the already flying prototype {{of a second}} company design initially called the Eclipse Concept Jet. The four-seat aircraft was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610F turbofan and was built in secrecy at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia by Swift Engineering and BaySys Technologies. The ECJ had first flown on July 2, 2007 and the company said then {{did not intend to}} place the aircraft into production but by May 2008 it began to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> for a production version designated the Eclipse 400.|$|E
25|$|As {{the civil}} war escalated, Lebanese militias grew {{stronger}} and soon surpassed the regular army. This rapidly undermined {{the authority of the}} central government. The government's ability to maintain order was also handicapped {{by the nature of the}} Lebanese Army. One of the smallest in the Middle East, it was composed based on a fixed ratio of religions. As members defected to sectarian militias, the army would eventually prove unable to contain the militant groups, rein in the PLO or monitor foreign infiltration. Since the government was Christian-dominated, especially the officers' ranks, trust among Muslims for central institutions, including the army, was low. The disintegration of the Lebanese Army was eventually initiated by Muslim deserters declaring that they would no longer <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from the Maronite generals.|$|E

25|$|With Nicolae Bălcescu and C. A. Rosetti, Vârnav {{also managed}} the Society of Romanian Students in Paris, whose revolutionary agenda {{brought him into}} {{conflict}} with European governments. He then played a small part in the French Revolution of 1848, before returning to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> at Neamț Monastery, a Hieromonk and Starets. Throughout the 1850s, {{he and his brother}} Constantin, who was the son-in-law of Gheorghe Bibescu, took part in the nationalist movement that established the United Principalities, and was especially active as an electoral campaigner. However, his support of modernization in schools and the church was not welcomed by the religious establishment, and his stand-off with the conservative monks of Neamț resulted in the establishment of a dissident monastery. Subsequently, Vârnav lost the backing of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, although he still approved of Cuza's authoritarian agenda.|$|E
25|$|After {{an early}} {{education}} provided by his father, Scarlat {{was selected by}} his mother to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> in the Moldavian Church. While tutored by Sofronie Miclescu, he escaped to his relatives in the Duchy of Bukovina, and later {{made his way to}} Paris. He lived there until 1848, taking degrees in Law, Letters and Philosophy from the College of Sorbonne. With his own private funds, Vârnav purchased the art collection of Aguado de las Marismas on the recommendation of Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare. It included paintings by Caravaggio, Philippe de Champaigne, Egbert van Heemskerck, Eustache Le Sueur, Pietro Liberi, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and François Stella; Vârnav also owned a copy of Philippoteaux's La Retraite de Russie, which was probably done by the artist himself, and which he may have purchased at the Exposition nationale des beaux-arts of Brussels, in 1842. In 1847, he donated all artworks in his possession to the Moldavian state, which took little interest in the offer. The collection was left to deteriorate at a shipyard in Galați.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to <b>take</b> <b>orders</b> from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.|$|E
