40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied both direct and {{indirect}} impacts of wind energy generation on fossil fueled generator emission rates within the same interconnected region. Specifically, we {{examine the relationship between}} increased levels of wind energy generation and emissions per unit of electricity produced using historical data for electricity output and CO 2, SO 2 and NOx emissions in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Using EPA’s Clean Air Markets hourly emissions data, we calculate the <b>total</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2, SO 2 and NOx per MWh of electricity output for the ERCOT system from 2008 – 2011. The EPA database includes CO 2, SO 2 and NOx emissions reported by facility owner and operators on an hourly basis in a manner that incorporates facility inefficiencies during ramping periods, allowing us to fully evaluate the emissions reductions achieved in ERCOT as a result of increased wind generation. Incorporating these impacts we find that primary impacts from wind generation outweight secondary impacts by several orders of magnitude. The paper is organized as follows: After the introduction the second section discusses regional implications of our research. The third section gives a brief overview of the existing literatur...|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{mapping of}} fuel {{combustion}} and CO 2 emission provides valuable information for inferring terrestrial carbon balance, modeling pollutant transport, and developing mitigation strategies. Previous inventories included {{only a limited}} number of fuel types and anthropogenic emissions were mapped using national population proxies which may distort the geographical distribution within countries. In this study, a sub-national disaggregation method (SDM) was applied to establish a global 0. 1 °× 0. 1 ° geo-referenced inventory of fuel combustion (PKU-FUEL) and a corresponding CO 2 emission inventory (PKU-CO 2) based upon 64 fuel sub-types for the year 2007. Uncertainties of the new inventories were evaluated using a Monte Carlo method. The <b>total</b> <b>combustion</b> CO 2 <b>emission</b> in 2007 was 11. 2 (9. 11 and 13. 3 as 5 th and 95 th percentiles) Pg C yr − 1. By replacing national disaggregation with sub-national disaggregation in this study, the average 95 th minus 5 th percentile ranges of CO 2 emission for all grids can be reduced from 417 to 68. 2 Mg km − 2 yr − 1, indicating a significant reduction in uncertainty, because the uneven distribution of per-capita fuel consumptions within countries has been taken into account by using the sub-national fuel consumption data directly. Significant difference in per-capita CO 2 emissions between urban and rural areas was found in developing nations (2. 09 vs. 0. 600 Mg C cap − 1 yr − 1), but not in developed ones (3. 57 vs. 3. 42 Mg C cap − 1 yr − 1), suggesting strong influence of the rapid urbanization of these countries on the carbon emission.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of used tires represents an environmental and health hazard, especially when large stockpiles of tires start on fire. This study focuses on ambient particulate matter samples {{collected during the}} Iowa City landfill tire fire and laboratory <b>emissions</b> of tire <b>combustion.</b> Levels of elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC), metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), azaarenes and oxygenated PAH (oxy-PAH) were determined by thermo-optical analysis, high precision mass, inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate that tire <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> are enriched in elemental carbon and PAH. Levels of hazardous metals, such as lead and zinc, are not enhanced in particulate emissions 4. 2 km from the fire. In addition, fresh tire <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> have increased amounts of lower molecular weight PAH in the particle phase when compared to diluted real world emissions. This is due to gas phase partitioning of lower molecular weight PAH in plume transport. To build on the prior, qualitative understanding of organic compounds in tire emissions, 15 total azaarenes and oxy-PAH were identified, including four azaarenes and three oxy-PAH that were identified in tire <b>combustion</b> <b>emission</b> for the first time. The combustion of tires has significant health implications, particularly when open burning occurs near populations.

In this work, TG-bridge was used for directly sampling of the <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> {{from the inside of}} the furnace and transferring them into the mass spectrometer (MS), without disturbing the sub-pressure conditions inside the MS ion source. The effect of Fire-Trol 931 (a long-term fire retardant) on the emissions, produced during the combustion of pine needles, is tested in the lab for future application in the field. It was shown that in treated samples, increased evolution of ammonia and aromatic compounds took place, compared to untreated samples. Maximum concentrations of specific compounds, such as benzene and toluene, evolved during the combustion experiments in the furnace, were determined. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

The various effects of IMWI on diesel <b>combustion</b> and <b>emissions</b> reflect on the dilution effect, thermal effect and chemical effect.

In this study, the dilution, thermal and chemical effects of IMWI on the <b>combustion</b> and <b>emissions</b> characteristics of a four-stroke, direct injection as well as turbocharged diesel engine are investigated by CFD simulation. The results indicate that IMWI reduces the in-cylinder mean pressure and temperature, and the ignition delay becomes longer. IMWI leads to a remarkable decrease of NOx and Soot emissions.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} relationships between combustion conditions, particle characteristics, and optical properties of fresh and photochemically processed <b>emissions</b> from biomass <b>combustion.</b> The combustion conditions included nominal and high burn rate operation and individual combustion phases from a conventional wood stove. Low temperature pyrolysis upon fuel addition resulted in "tar-ball" type particles dominated by organic aerosol with an absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) of 2. 5 - 2. 7 and estimated Brown Carbon contributions of 50 - 70 % to absorption at the climate relevant aethalometer-wavelength (520 nm). High temperature combustion during the intermediate (flaming) phase was dominated by soot agglomerates with AAE 1. 0 - 1. 2 and 85 - 100 % of absorption at 520 nm attributed to Black Carbon. Intense photochemical processing of high burn rate flaming <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> in an oxidation flow reactor led to strong formation of Secondary Organic Aerosol, with no or weak absorption. PM 1 mass emission factors (mg/kg) of fresh emissions were about {{an order of magnitude}} higher for low temperature pyrolysis compared to high temperature <b>combustion.</b> However, <b>emission</b> factors describing the absorption cross section emitted per kg of fuel consumed (m(2) /kg) were of similar magnitude at 520 nm for the diverse combustion conditions investigated in this study.

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} from field and laboratory observations coupled with atmospheric model analyses shows that primary <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> of organic compounds dynamically partition between the vapor and particulate phases, especially as near-source emissions dilute and cool to ambient conditions. The most recent {{version of the}} Community Multiscale Air Quality model version 5. 2 (CMAQv 5. 2) accounts for the semivolatile partitioning and gas-phase aging of these primary organic aerosol (POA) compounds consistent with experimentally derived parameterizations.

There is currently no regional emissions inventory that provides estimates of anthropogenic combustion for the African continent. This work provides a quantification of the evolution of African <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> from 2005 to 2030, using a bottom-up method. This inventory predicts very large increases in black carbon, organic carbon, CO, NOx, SO 2 and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions if no emission regulations are implemented.

The estimated trends in African emissions are consistent with emissions provided by global inventories, but they display a larger range of values. African <b>combustion</b> <b>emissions</b> contributed significantly to global emissions in 2005.
