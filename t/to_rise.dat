5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes.

However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
