In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.|$|E

5|$|On the October 16, 1847, {{the two men}} {{set out for the}} {{mountain}} of kenya. With <b>them</b> <b>came</b> eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named Bwana Kheri.

Many of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew {{represented}} him {{as being}} a leader, and it appears likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the Royal James. He {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction of the ship and what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of <b>them</b> <b>came,</b> and thus only a leader who commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.|$|E

5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with <b>them</b> <b>came</b> an array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in a den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
5|$|Series 5 {{began on}} 27 September 1997 {{and saw a}} number of changes, the biggest saw the white set {{replaced}} with a new one which maintained the same shape and layout, but was curvier and larger which coincided with the show moving into the larger Studio 6. This series also saw the introduction of Ben Ward, Richard Webb and Gerard Foster (known as Ben, Gez & Rich) of The Cheese Shop {{who took over the}} comedy from 'Trev and Simon'. With <b>them</b> <b>came</b> new sketches including The Staffroom which featured the three of them portray school teachers Mr Wazzock (Foster), Mr Moody (Ward) and Mr Slack (Webb). They also created a fictitious 60s pop group called The Krazees and even created a song called We're So Crazy even though it was never released.|$|E

5|$|Snyder {{hoped to}} have {{principal}} photography take place from JuneSeptember 2007, but filming was delayed until September 17, 2007. Snyder wanted a $150 million budget, but Warner Bros. preferred the budget remain under $100 million; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $120 million. The production took place in Vancouver, where a New York City back lot was built. Sound stages were used for apartments and offices, while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens. Ten visual effects companies, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among <b>them,</b> <b>came</b> on board {{to work on the}} film, which ended up having 1,100 shots featuring effects, a quarter of them being computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka and burn <b>them</b> <b>came</b> directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, who was very concerned about covering up Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E
5|$|There were 100 cyclists {{signed up}} for the race, but only 76 of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> to the start. One of the absentees was Henri Cornet, winner of the 1904 Tour de France.

The riders were not grouped in teams, but some cyclists had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together.

5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not come near enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, and neither of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> close enough either.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{probably}} {{arrived in}} Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority {{emerged in the}} 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Oghaminscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now {{generally considered to be}} of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with <b>them</b> <b>came</b> the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.|$|E
5|$|George Mason's great-grandfather, George Mason I, {{had been}} a Cavalier: militarily {{defeated}} in the English Civil War, some of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> to America in the 1640s and 1650s. He {{had been born in}} 1629 at Pershore, in the English county of Worcestershire. The immigrant George Mason settled in what is now Stafford County, Virginia, having obtained land as a reward for bringing his party to the colony as 50 acres were awarded for each person transported into the Colony of Virginia. His son, George Mason II (1660–1716), was the first to move to what in 1742 became Fairfax County, then at the frontier between English and Native American areas. George Mason III (1690–1735) served in the House of Burgesses and, like his father, was county lieutenant. George Mason IV's mother, Ann Thomson Mason, was the daughter of a former Attorney General of Virginia who had immigrated from London and was of a Yorkshire family.|$|E

5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind <b>them</b> <b>came</b> carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
5|$|S. Paranavitana {{offered a}} novel surmise {{explaining}} {{the origins of}} the Ariyacakravarti. According to him the Aryacakravarti are descendants of Chandrabhanu a Malay chieftain, who invaded the island from Tambralinga in 1247. According to him refugees and immigrants from the Indian kingdom of Kalinga founded similarly named Kingdoms in South East Asia, and some of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> due to various reasons to north Sri Lanka and founded the Jaffna Kingdom. This view has been refuted by noted Indian historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastry as having no credible evidence, and other historians such as Louis Charles Damais (1911–66), an expert on Indonesian studies, Yutaka Iwamoto (1910–88), a Buddhist scholar, and S. Pathmanathan. They assert that there were no kingdoms in South East Asia called Kalinga and such assertions are based on erroneous readings of the Chinese name for a locality called Ho-ling which actually stood for Walain not Kalinga. Further S. Pathmanathan asserts that Chandrabhanu had categorically claimed Padmavamsa lineage whereas S. Paranavitana had adduced a Gangavamsa lineage to the Aryacakravarti. Further he notes that the inscriptions that S. Paranavitana used to make his theory have not been deciphered by any other scholar to imply a Javaka connection to the Aryacakravartis.|$|E
5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of <b>them</b> <b>came</b> away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.|$|E
