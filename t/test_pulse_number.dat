40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} two methods to measure Ca 2 + channel inactivation in Lymnaea neurons—one method, {{based upon the}} conventional double-pulse protocol, uses currents during a moderately large depolarizing pulse, and the other uses tail currents after a very strong activating pulse. Both methods avoid contamination by proton currents and are unaffected by rundown of Ca 2 + current. The magnitude of inactivation measured differs for the two methods; this difference arises because the measurement of inactivation is inherently dependent upon the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> voltage used to monitor the Ca 2 + channel conductance. We discuss two models that can generate such <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence of inactivation measurements—a two-channel model and a two-open-state model. The first model accounts for this by assuming the existence of two types of Ca 2 + channels, different proportions of which are activated by the different <b>test</b> <b>pulses.</b> The second model assumes only one Ca 2 + channel type, with two closed and open states; in this model, the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> dependence {{is due to the}} differential activation of channels in the two closed states by the <b>test</b> <b>pulses.</b> Test pulse dependence of inactivation measurements of Ca 2 + channels may be a general phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{subthreshold}} depolarization on mechanical threshold {{was investigated in}} tetrodotoxin-poisoned mammalian and amphibian skeletal muscle fibers using a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique.

The consequent increase in the <b>test</b> <b>pulse</b> threshold was linearly related {{to the size of}} the depolarization and there was, on the average, a 10 % increase in threshold for a 10 -mV depolarization in mammalian fibers. The duration of the inhibitory period was also related {{to the size of the}} depolarization.

However, the mean use time and mean amplitude of the individual sparks are quite similar at all test depolarizations and at all times during a given depolarization, indicating that the channel open times and conductances underlying sparks are essentially independent of voltage.
