500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> going was... {{to jump in}} the air and execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I do need a change, just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> going again really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high on my list. There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm going to have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; {{this was the first time}} she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E
500|$|The third ODI saw {{a change}} of venue; the teams moving from Dhaka to the coastal town of Chittagong. England again made two bowling changes, seamers Shahzad and Liam Plunkett coming into {{the team with the}} injured Broad and spinner Tredwell making way. Bangladesh {{remained}} unchanged from the second ODI. The hosts won their first toss of the series, and put England into bat. Kieswetter bucked his natural game and played cautiously: when partner Cook was dismissed for 32 in the 13th over, he had scored 20 off 33 balls. The opener continued to accumulate runs carefully until he reached his half-century in the 33rd over. After passing the milestone, he began to score quicker, cutting and driving as he shared a 74-run partnership with Collingwood. He reached his century with a scampered run off Rubel Hossain, his first in international cricket, in his third ODI appearance. At 22 years and 97 days old, he became the second youngest England batsman to score an ODI century after David Gower. In contrast to the [...] "all-action" [...] style that had been expected from him, Kieswetter accrued his century with resolve, saying after the match that: [...] "In the first two games I wasn't quite aware tactically of how I was going to pace my innings, [...] helping the team win the game. Today I tried to pace myself a bit more, and try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> in more before playing big shots." [...] His dismissal soon after his century brought Wright to the crease with the freedom to make an aggressive cameo, notching 32 runs off just 13 balls to help England towards a total of 284.|$|E

[...] Speaking about her arrest, Wolf said, [...] "I was taken into custody for disobeying an {{unlawful}} order. [...] The issue is that I actually know New York City permit law ... I didn’t choose <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> arrested. I chose to obey the law and that didn’t protect me." ...|$|E

2500|$|McPhatter {{was first}} {{replaced}} by original member David Baughan, {{who had already}} been singing lead in concert while McPhatter was in the service. Baughan's voice was similar to McPhatter's, but his erratic behavior made him difficult {{to work with and}} unsuitable in the eyes of Atlantic Records executives. [...] Baughan soon left the group to form the Harps (1955) (finding his way back into Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters in 1958), and was replaced by Selma native Johnny Moore (formerly of The Hornets). September 1955 saw this lineup record a major double-sided R hit with the A side's [...] "Adorable", reaching number one and the B side, [...] "Steamboat", going to number five. These were followed by [...] "Ruby Baby" [...] in February 1956, and [...] "I Got <b>To</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Myself</b> A Woman".|$|E
2500|$|Northamptonshire's Charl Pietersen took 7 for 10 at Svanholm Park, Brøndby as Denmark {{fell to the}} competition's second lowest {{score in}} its history, for 56 all out. 24 of those runs were extras, with no Dane scoring more than 8 with the bat. Pietersen, who was playing in his debut match for the Northants first team said, [...] "The ball was {{swinging}} about and they were perfect conditions for bowling. I just concentrated on getting {{the ball in the}} right areas and the conditions did the rest. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've been given by Northants. I'm here to learn and try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> in the first team on a regular basis. No cricketer wants to play second-team cricket and I'm no different. But one performance won't get me in, I've got to be consistent with my wicket-taking and my economy." ...|$|E

The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing. At the moment I don't have any fire in the belly for a fight or <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> to a gym." [...] However, Hatton also added: [...] "But it has been only 13 months and I am only 31, so never count me out." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, the Lakers played the New Orleans Hornets, a team they beat four times in the regular season. The Lakers lost 109–100 in their opener in the playoffs to the Hornets, who were led by Chris Paul and his 33 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds. The Lakers had not lost a playoff opener at home in 15 years. Bryant had 34 points on 13-for-26 shooting, while Gasol had eight points on two-of-nine shooting, six rebounds, zero {{offensive}} rebounds and poor defense on pick-and-roll plays. [...] "It's up to me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>myself</b> going, be more aggressive, get myself into rhythm", Gasol said. [...] "He's not naturally aggressive", Bryant said. Bynum and Barnes played after injuries at the end of the regular season, while Blake remained out with the chicken pox. The Lakers won Game 2, 87–78, led by Bynum's 17points and 11rebounds. [...] Odom scored 16points, and Artest added 15. [...] Bryant had only 11points, but insisted to Jackson that he guard Paul, who finished with 20points and nineassists. Gasol had eight points and five rebounds, and shot just four-for-19 from the field in the first two games. Blake returned in Game 2 and did not score but had five assists and three rebounds. Bryant scored 30points, Gasol added 17points and 10rebounds, and the Lakers won Game 3 in New Orleans, 100–86. Bryant again helped to defend Paul, who had 22points, eight assists, and five turnovers. The Lakers lost 93–88 in Game 4 as Paul had 27points, 15assists and 13rebounds and the smaller Hornets outrebounded the Lakers 39–32 and held a 20–4 advantage second-chance points. Bryant was scoreless in the first half, shooting 0–7, and he finished with 17points on 5–18 shooting. Bryant sprained his left ankle with 1:32 remaining in the game, and used crutches to leave the arena. Bryant, after refusing to get an MRI exam and X-rays, played in Game 5 and had two spectacular dunks in a 106–90 victory. The larger Laker front line helped the team regain control in rebounds with a 42–25 advantage over the Hornets, resulting in a 22–2 disparity in second-chance points. Bynum had 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers won the series 4–2 with a 98–80 win in Game 6. Bryant scored 22 of his 24 points in the first three quarters, and Bynum had 18points and 12rebounds. The Lakers again outrebounded New Orleans, 43–30, and held the advantage in second-chance points, 21–4. Paul had 10 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Hornets head coach Monty Williams said, [...] "Kobe's Kobe, but I thought Bynum decided the series. He was that good." ...|$|E
