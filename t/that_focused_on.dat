50|$|Deleuze’s {{cinematic}} taxonomy {{emerges from}} the philosophy of Henri Bergson in Matter and Memory (1896).

Deleuze sees a correspondence between Bergson’s tripartite formulation and the cinematic medium. There are thus three types of cinematic movement-images: perception images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> what is seen), affection images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> expressions of feeling) and action images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the duration of action).
