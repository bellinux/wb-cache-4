5|$|The further {{evolution}} of Callisto after accretion {{was determined by}} the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through <b>thermal</b> <b>conduction</b> near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.|$|E

25|$|The {{accretion}} process probably {{lasted for}} several thousand {{years before the}} moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Tethys's outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 155K {{at a depth of}} about 29km. After the end of formation due to <b>thermal</b> <b>conduction,</b> the subsurface layer cooled and the interior heated up. The cooling near-surface layer contracted and the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in Tethys's crust reaching estimates of 5.7 MPa, which likely led to cracking.|$|E
25|$|The fire-tube boiler is characterised by {{internal}} tubes {{connected to the}} firebox that guide the smoke and hot combustion gases through the pressurised wet area of the boiler.

25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by <b>thermal</b> <b>conduction.</b> Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E

The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E

40|$|With the proposes of {{improving}} occupant's thermal comfort {{and reducing the}} air conditioning power consumption, the present research carried out a comprehensive study on the surface <b>thermal</b> <b>conductions</b> and their influence parameters. A numerical model was built considering the transient conduction, convective and radiation heat transfer inside a vehicle cabin. For more accurate simulation of the radiation heat transfer behaviors, the radiation was considered into two spectral bands (short wave and long wave radiation), and the solar radiation was calculated by two solar fluxes (beam and diffuse solar radiation). An experiment was conducted to validate the numerical approach, showing a good agreement with the surface temperature. The surface thermal conditions were numerically simulated. The {{results show that the}} solar radiation is {{the most important factor in}} determining the internal surface thermal conditions. Effects of the window glass properties and the car body surface conditions were investigated. The numerical calculation results indicate that reducing the transitivity of window glass can effectively reduce the internal surface temperature. And the reflectivity of the vehicle cabin also has an important influence on the surface temperature, however, it's not so obvious as comparison to the window glass...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the electrical conduction processes in as-grown and thermally cycled ZnO single crystal as well as as-grown ZnO polycrystalline films over the wide temperature range 20 [...] 500 K. In the case of ZnO single crystal between 110 and 500 K, two types of <b>thermal</b> activation <b>conduction</b> processes are observed. This is {{explained in terms of}} the existence of both shallow donors and intermediately deep donors which are consecutively excited to the conduction band as the temperature increases. By measuring the resistivity ρ(T) of a given single crystal after repeated thermal cycling in vacuum, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies {{play an important role in}} governing the shallow donor concentrations but leave the activation energy (≃ 27 ± 2 meV) largely intact. In the case of polycrystalline films, two types of <b>thermal</b> activation <b>conduction</b> processes are also observed between ∼ 150 and 500 K. Below ∼ 150 K, we found an additional conduction process due to the nearest-neighbor-hopping conduction mechanism which takes place in the shallow impurity band. As the temperatures further decreases below ∼ 80 K, a crossover to the Mott variable-range-hopping conduction process is observed.
