5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} house across the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E

5|$|Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall {{stations}} were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 {{by members of}} the London Railway Preservation Society <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, but no longer has a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.|$|E
5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, {{more and more people}} begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E

5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
5|$|In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop; he was consecrated 24 April 767, {{the feast}} {{day of his}} {{predecessor}} Wilfrid. This may have been deliberate and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see. Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773. Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop. Much of Alcuin's description of Æthelbert's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric, as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> role model.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E

One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to believe that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures termites, and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites {{date back to the}} Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy, preeminent in the Mediterranean {{since the}} Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, sought to disrupt French convoys across the Adriatic. Following the Russian {{withdrawal}} in 1807, the Royal Navy dispatched a small frigate squadron {{to operate in}} the sea. The squadron was commanded by Captain William Hoste, who seized the Illyrian island of Lissa (present-day Vis) <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base, waging a campaign against the French and their allies that forced the French Navy to deploy significantly larger forces to combat him. This escalating series of raid and counter raid continued until March 1811, when the French commander in the Adriatic, Bernard Dubourdieu attacked Lissa with force twice that available to Hoste. In the ensuing battle Hoste not only routed his opponents, but captured two ships, sank another and killed Dubourdieu.|$|E

The lower floor of the statehouse was used by the Indiana House of Representatives.

The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> courthouse.
