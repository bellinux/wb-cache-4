25|$|Soft Mouth Springers {{are taught}} to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not {{puncture}} it with his teeth. The game should always be fit for the table. If a springer damages the bird, {{it may be hard}} mouthed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> fault, but {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard mouthed.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{any work}} of art that existed prior to 1945 has a {{potential}} provenance problem. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> obstacle for anyone who currently collects pre-1945 European art. To avoid wasting thousands or even millions of dollars, they must verify (normally {{with the assistance of}} an art historian and a lawyer specializing in art law) that potential acquisitions were not stolen by the Nazis from a Holocaust victim. The highest-profile legal case arising from this problem is the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2006), in which the Court held that U.S. courts could retroactively apply the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to Austria for torts that allegedly occurred before 1976.|$|E

Mason explained that many things had changed for Chris since the attack and the seizure compounded his fear {{that he will be}} struggling {{for the rest of his}} life. Chris was also worried that he had developed epilepsy like Andrew did, but doctors informed him that the seizure was a temporary symptom of his brain injury. Chris was kept in hospital overnight, which meant his romantic plans with his partner Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) were put on hold. However, Nate turned up at the hospital and Mason said, [...] "The two of them just cuddle, and for the first time Chris realises <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> relationship." [...] Nate then told Chris he loved him for the first time.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{maintained}} his reputation in 1942, with Put Out More Flags, which sold well despite wartime restrictions {{on paper and}} printing. Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to Brideshead Revisited three years later, {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic Ocean. Bridesheads selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages. Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. Brideshead's Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, Conor Cruise O'Brien who, in the Irish literary magazine The Bell, wrote of Waugh's [...] "almost mystical veneration" [...] for the upper classes. Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh's genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan alter ego and that he had lost his detachment: [...] "In art so naturally ironic and detached as his, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> loss". Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, Graham Greene and, in glowing terms, by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford. In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: [...] "I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book".|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between internal and kinetic energy {{is hard to}} make in the presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular random motion of molecules that is classified as internal energy. [...] The rate of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into internal energy, whether in turbulent or in streamlined flow, is an important quantity in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially inhomogeneous systems.|$|E

[...] At more advanced ages, the prostate {{is less likely to}} grow during that person's remaining lifetime. This is generally caused by damage to the primary nerves serving the penile area, which pass near the prostate gland.

However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do."

2500|$|The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology {{quotes a}} similar form—"bowgard" [...] (and [...] "bouguer"), but {{claims that the}} Bulgarians were heretics [...] "as {{belonging}} to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> mistake, because the Greek and the Albigensian churches have never been connected. What is more, if one follows the logic of events, the Albigensian Church is an opponent of the Greek one insofar as the Albigensians are genetically linked with the Bogomils who, in turn, are against the Orthodox (Greek) church on principle. A similar confusion of the Bulgarian Bogomil church and the Greek (Orthodox) church {{can also be found}} in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, where the word [...] "bugger" [...] is given only with the meaning of sodomite, [...] "from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical".

2500|$|The TDWRs and NEXRADs {{complement}} each other with overlapping coverage, each designed to optimally view different airspace regimes. TDWR's rapid update rate over short range (55 nmi range) captures microscale weather events quickly in terminal airspace. NEXRAD is a long range radar (200 nmi range) designed to serve multiple en route functions at high altitude, above terminal airspace, and far between terminals. NEXRAD's slower update rate covering a wider volume, captures mesoscale weather events. The shorter [...] wavelength, which {{is closer to the}} size of a raindrop than the [...] wavelength, is partially absorbed by precipitation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> drawback to using TDWR, as the signal can be strongly attenuated in heavy precipitation. This attenuation means that the radar cannot [...] "see" [...] very far through heavy rain and could miss severe weather such as strong thunderstorms which may contain the signature of a tornado, when there is heavy rain falling between the radar and that storm. When heavy rain is falling on the radome, the range of the TDWR is further limited. Finally, hail in a thunderstorm scanned by a TDWR can entirely block the signal as its size is larger than the wavelength.|$|E
