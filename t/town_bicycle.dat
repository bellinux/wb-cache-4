5000|$|In the 19th century, Deventer {{became an}} {{industrial}} <b>town.</b> <b>Bicycles</b> (Burgers), carpets (Koninklijke Deventer Tapijtfabriek), tins and cans {{for food and}} drinks (Thomassen & Drijver), cigars (Horst & Maas en Bijdendijk & Ten Hove), foundry and heavy machinery (Nering Bögel), and textiles (Ankersmit) were produced until {{the mid to late}} 20th century.

50|$|The {{world of}} 1909, in which 'motors' can be driven across fields and through gated lanes by a twelve-year-old Gwyneth, {{and where a}} {{telegram}} is brought from the post office in the nearest <b>town</b> by <b>bicycle,</b> contrasts starkly with the air crash that features in Robins in the Abbey and the car accident and BBC news bulletins of New Girls at Wood End - and with the ownership {{and use of the}} telephone in the latter two titles as a normal and common feature.|$|R
60|$|Kalliope, who had wisely abstained from {{adding a}} useless {{voice to the}} discussion, here demurred. She {{could not think of}} such a thing; they could very well wait in the {{carriage}} while Captain Henderson went on to the <b>town</b> on his <b>bicycle</b> and sent out a midge.|$|R

5000|$|Maps: ADFC is {{involved}} in the publication of a bicycle map series on a scale of 1:150.000 (according to the publisher’s imprint Germany’s most purchased cycle tour map) as well as of regional maps on a scale of 1:75.000 (occasionally also 1:100.000 or 1:50.000) and often creates bike maps right up to <b>bicycle</b> <b>town</b> plans following the slogan [...] "from cyclists for cyclists."

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} spatial {{patterns}} of bicycle use for commuting {{and the risk}} cyclists run being injured in a road accident when commuting to work in Belgium. Exploratory data analyses suggest that the observed differences {{in the use of}} the bicycle to get to work are strongly linked to the urban hierarchy: commuters are more inclined to cycle in cities and specifically in regional towns (with 25 000 to 120 000 inhabitants). In large cities (more than 200 000 inhabitants), less commuting by bicycle takes place. The relationship between bicycle use and the risk of being seriously injured or killed in a road accident is also studied. A cluster analysis confirms that high proportions of commuter cyclists are correlated with low risks of becoming a casualty. It also shows that there are strong spatial differences (regional and between different types of <b>towns)</b> in <b>bicycle</b> use and the risk of an accident. This suggests that cycling policies should be spatially differentiated...|$|R
5000|$|Annually, {{in early}} April, the <b>town</b> hosts a <b>bicycle</b> race that draws {{professional}} and amateur teams {{from around the}} country. The [...] "Garrett Lemire Memorial Grand Prix" [...] began in 2004 {{as a tribute to}} a 22-year-old cyclist from Ojai who died racing his bicycle in Arizona the previous year. The race is held on a 1 mi circuit that circumnavigates Libbey Bowl in the heart of downtown Ojai. Proceeds from event promote cycling safety and education in local schools.Also in April, [...] "The Ojai" [...] tennis tournament is held. It is the oldest tennis tournament west of the Mississippi River (founded in the 1887) and has been an early competition for many players who went on to earn one or more Grand Slam titles.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{a rainbow}} appears and the three, along with Steve and Mutt, race across <b>town</b> on their <b>bicycles</b> {{to get to}} the rainbow. Upon arrival, they witness the rainbow land and are sucked into a {{colourful}} pathway, taking photographs as they go. They then enter a dark area of the rainbow filled with gold, Steve taking three pieces which causes the rainbow to vanish and drop the group in a cornfield. They are revealed to be in Kansas, and are taken to the local sheriff's office at an airport. Sheriff Wyatt Hampton contacts Jackie to pick them up, but the group flee into the airport to print their photos of the rainbow's interior. Jackie and Frank come to the children's aid when they arrive back in Hudson Harbour, but no one believes their story except Frank. Steve sells one of the pieces of gold to a pawnbroker's, and another to the street gang, and attempts to join, only to be humiliated and rejected. The children's school science teacher, Sam Cohen, obtains the photos and discovers the children's project.|$|R
