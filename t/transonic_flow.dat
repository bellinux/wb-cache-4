The {{most important of}} such image based measurement techniques are those for the measurement of planar flow velocity fields, planar pressure distribution, model location and deformation, model temperature and quantitative high speed flow visualization. The applications as carried out by DLR range from low speed <b>flows</b> to <b>transonic</b> <b>flows,</b> from high lift configurations to propellers and rotors, from wake vortex investigations in catapult facilities and water towing tanks to investigations of vortex break down phenomena on delta wings. The capability to use image based measurement techniques in <b>transonic</b> <b>flows</b> requires dedicated technical developments and experienced scientists due to the special environment of a transonic wind tunnel.
