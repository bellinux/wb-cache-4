5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To examine <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> and {{fatality}} in cohorts {{of patients}} diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 1975 to 1999. Methods: This study uses National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data and derives hazard functions {{in order to}} examine the fatality in thyroid cancer. Results: The study documents forms of rapidly evolving and fatal tumors as well as forms of tumor that evolve more slowly to cause death. It demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> nonfatal forms of thyroid cancer have risen dramatically in the years from 1975 to 1999 —mostly due to papillary carcinomas—but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> fatal forms of thyroid cancer have remained nearly constant...|$|R

25|$|Establishing the {{incidence}} of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may {{have been attributed to}} another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0–3.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> aortic dissection may be rising. Men are more commonly affected than women: 65% of all people with aortic dissection are male. The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years.

25|$|The precise {{effect of}} the food crisis on German health and {{mortality}} has {{been a matter of}} some contention. Speaking of the Anglo-American zones, Herbert Hoover reported that in the fall of 1946, starvation produced a 40 percent increase in mortality among Germans over 70. However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> hunger oedema was low in 1946–1947. According to the British Medical Journal, mortality in the British zone was above its pre-war level until June, 1946, when the death rate fell below that of 1938. Also, once it became clear there would be no rising, as threatened by the Nazis during the war, food controls were relaxed.|$|E
25|$|Cousin {{marriages are}} {{decreasing}} among Iranians. Since the Pahlavi era less Iranians has practised cousin marriages.

Additionally, the proportion of cousin marriage among urban families stayed constant: it was only rural families that drove the increase. For all periods the proportion of cousin marriage among highly educated women was somewhat lower than among uneducated women. It is hypothesized that decreases in infant mortality during the period may have created a larger pool of eligible cousins to marry.|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} rare, but dramatic, {{side effect}} associated with trazodone is priapism, {{likely due to}} its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during {{the first month of}} treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Clinical reports have also described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Ajzen {{expanded}} {{upon the}} theory of reasoned action, formulating {{the theory of}} planned behaviour, which also emphasises the role of intention in behaviour performance but is intended to cover cases {{in which a person}} is not in control of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behaviour. As a result, the new theory states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> actual behaviour performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behaviour and the strength of the individual's intention in performing the behaviour. In his article, Further hypothesises that self-efficacy is important in determining the strength of the individual's intention to perform a behaviour. In 2010, Fishbein and Ajzen introduced the reasoned action approach, the successor of the theory of planned behaviour.|$|E

Depending on the criteria for determining prevalence, studies estimate the prevalence of SS at 500,000 to 2 million people in the United States. Moreover, other broader studies of prevalence of SS range widely with some reports of up to a prevalence of 3% of the population.
