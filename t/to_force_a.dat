5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E

The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.|$|E

5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5|$|Davidson struck 46runs in {{the first}} innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, then tore his {{hamstring}} muscle after bowling only 3.4 overs. Australia, with a bowler short, was unable <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> win without him. The Fifth Test was on his home ground at Sydney with the series locked 1–1. He captured 3/43 and 3/80, taking a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket when Alan Smith was caught at slip by Bob Simpson. This left Australia with a target of 241 in 60 overs, but {{there was to be}} no fairytale finish as the match ended in a draw.|$|E

He scored 105 in the Test trial for Richardson's XI and then struck 145 against arch-rivals Victoria in the last match of the season; New South Wales were unable <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> victory and thus ceded the Sheffield Shield to their southern neighbours.

5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> revaluation.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E

The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 21 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> 22 draw.

5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not be done in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer {{replaced}} von Pohl, who {{was suffering}} from liver cancer. A week later on the 18th, Scheer hoisted his flag aboard Friedrich der Grosse. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. On 25–26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21–22 April.|$|E

5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>a</b> recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado.
