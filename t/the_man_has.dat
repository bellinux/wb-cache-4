5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, left at the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of the baggage compartment {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning of}} a temple, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>Man,</b> <b>has</b> become a {{tradition}} activity at the event. It takes place the evening after {{the destruction of the}} Man. Sculptor David Best's temple projects were ritually burned from 2000 to 2004. The tradition of participants inscribing the surfaces of the piece with personal messages has continued through all of the iterations of the temple.|$|E

25|$|The marriage, {{base of the}} {{domestic}} group, is settled after <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> formally courted the woman with accepted gifts and she has acceded to live with him. In order {{to look for a}} pairing, a man must have gone through an initiation ritual in which he endures several penalties and difficulties, to demonstrate the fundamental abilities for the subsistence and consumes a hallucinogen (Virola sp.).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the woman needs {{a high level}} of trust in the man on top who is in a {{dominant}} position vis-a-vis the woman below. Once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man's weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> control of the rhythm and depth of his thrusts, in the most sexually sensitive part of her body.|$|E
25|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a feisty Punjabi girl who is sent off track when she bumps into a {{depressed}} Mumbai businessman on an overnight train to Delhi. While attempting to get him back on board when he alights at a station stop, both are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Having walked out of his corporate business after being dumped by his girlfriend, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> no destination in mind, until the girl forces him to accompany her back home and then on to elope with her secret boyfriend.|$|E

25|$|A man {{may only}} take a second wife if a judge authorizes it, and only {{if there is an}} {{exceptional}} and objective justification for it, the first wife consents, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> sufficient resources to support the two families and guarantee all maintenance rights, accommodation and equality in all aspects of life. Moreover, a woman can stipulate in her marriage contract that her husband may not take a second wife, and a first wife must consent to the second. The first wife may also petition for divorce if the husband takes another wife.|$|E
25|$|During sexual intercourse, {{most women}} {{experience}} involuntary vaginal contractions. The contraction causes the pelvic muscles to tighten around the penis, {{which in turn}} increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm; which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, {{but this is not}} always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a woman on top position.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E

25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing {{what they are going to}} do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E
500|$|The {{inscription}} next to {{the figure}} of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> been deciphered either as “Michael despot, in Christ [...] God... faithful” or “Michael despot, in Christ [...] God faithful, son of Tsar Michael”. Either reading presents significant challenges as to the proper identification of the portrayed person, who was clearly a despot, bore the name Michael, and, if the latter reading is correct, {{was the son of}} an eponymous tsar. As a result, various theories have been proposed by Bulgarian and Serbian researchers alike.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E

500|$|In the lyrics, Spears {{lets the}} subject {{know he is}} on her radar, while she lists the qualities <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has.</b> Kimberly Chou said Spears' {{delivery}} [...] " [...] so aggressive it's almost threatening." [...] Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Confidence is a must / cockiness is a plus / edginess is a rush / edges I like 'em rough / A man with a Midas touch / Intoxicate me I'm a lush." [...] During the bridge she sings [...] "I got my eye on you / And I can't let you get away", making clear her attraction.|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not going to {{look at it as a}} negative. This is a tribute for what <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the first single [...] "Gimme More", a dance-pop and electropop song. The song opens with a spoken intro in which Spears says the line [...] "It's Britney, bitch". The lyrics appears to be about dance and sex, {{although}} they are actually about the media's fascination with her private life, {{as noted in the}} lines [...] "Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin' / They keep watchin', keep watchin'". The next song and second single, [...] "Piece of Me" [...] runs through a down-tempo dance beat and consists of over-the-top vocal distortions, causing a split sound effect and making it difficult to discern which voice is Spears'. It talks about fame and is written like a biography retelling her mishaps, while she sings in a nearly spoken manner. The third track of the album, [...] "Radar", is an electropop and Euro disco song which features distorted synthesizers emulating sonar pulses, that received comparisons to those of Soft Cell's [...] "Tainted Love" [...] (1981). In the lyrics, Spears lets the subject know he is on her radar, while she lists the qualities <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>has.</b>|$|E
