5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940. Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia, however, <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> the impact of {{an attack on the}} islands.|$|E

30|$|It {{was clear}} that in the regions characterised by a strong {{tradition}} in sheep and goat farming and a good infrastructure in milk commercialization, farmers opted for production intensification, and this led <b>to</b> <b>lessening</b> of the grazing contribution to animal feed.|$|R
5|$|Fixed-speed loads {{subject the}} motor {{to a high}} {{starting}} torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current.

5|$|Lawton {{lies in a}} dry {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with frequent variations in weather daily, except during the constantly hot and dry summer months. Frequent strong winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> the hotter weather. Northerly winds during the winter can occasionally intensify cold periods.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} {{and certain}} other AAS, nandrolone is not potentiated in androgenic tissues like the scalp, skin, and prostate, and hence, deleterious effects in these tissues are <b>lessened</b> <b>to</b> a degree. This is because nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase to the much weaker androgen 5α-dihydronandrolone (DHN), which has both reduced {{affinity for the}} androgen receptor (AR) relative to nandrolone in vitro and weaker androgenic activity in vivo. The lack of alkylation on the 17α-carbon drastically reduces the hepatotoxic potential of nandrolone. Estrogenic effects resulting from reaction with aromatase are also reduced due <b>to</b> <b>lessened</b> enzyme interaction, but effects such as gynaecomastia and reduced libido may still occur at sufficiently high doses.|$|R
50|$|Burkina Faso's {{relations}} with its West African neighbors have improved in recent years. Relations with Ghana, in particular, have warmed {{with a change}} in government in that country. President Compaoré has mediated a political crisis in Togo and helped to resolve the Tuareg conflict in Niger. Burkina maintains cordial {{relations with}} Libya. A territorial dispute with Mali was mediated by Ghana and Nigeria, which has led <b>to</b> <b>lessening</b> of tensions between the two nations.|$|R

50|$|Engine tuning is an adjustment, {{modification}} of the internal combustion engine, or modification to its control unit, otherwise known as its ECU (Engine Control Unit). It is adjusted to yield optimal performance, to increase an engine's power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be mutually exclusive, and an engine may be detuned with respect to output (work) in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due <b>to</b> <b>lessened</b> stress on engine components.|$|R

30|$|The {{observational}} {{design of}} our study may have not sufficiently controlled for confounding factors impacting the choice of ventilation mode or the decision of antibiotic prescribing. However, {{the fact that the}} same physicians took these decisions throughout the study period has probably contributed <b>to</b> <b>lessening</b> the risk of selection bias. Notwithstanding, in the present study, the choice of a hard outcome such as ICU mortality precludes from other threats to observational studies such as detection bias.|$|R
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. <b>To</b> <b>lessen</b> their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> the ecological impact on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E

50|$|By 1934, {{shipworm}} {{and lack}} of preventive maintenance had materially weakened the wooden structures. From 1934 explosives were railed from Victoria directly to the Dry Creek explosives depot. By 1947 all explosives were delivered this way. In 1950 urgent safety relevant repairs were ordered, but were not conducted until September 1952. Decreasing revenue from the port trade led <b>to</b> <b>lessened</b> maintenance and dredging of the Broad Creek landing. The jetty was last used in February 1970 and demolished about 1976.|$|R
50|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>lessening</b> {{passenger}} traffic {{and changes in}} the shipment of freight, Southern Pacific closed the station in the early 1970s, leaving Santa Susana Depot empty and destined for demolition. The County of Ventura purchased the depot from the railroad for $1.06. In May 1975 the building was divided into three parts and moved by truck to county property two miles east of the site it was built on. The County of Ventura designated the building Landmark #29 in January, 1976.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> any sense of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally {{able to get into}} the story, in part due to the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} wife, the late Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier not only {{restored}} the palace, {{but from the}} 1970s also made it the headquarters of a large and thriving business, which encouraged light industry to Monaco, the aim of which was <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> Monaco's dependence on the income from gambling. This involved land reclamation, {{the development of new}} beaches, and high rise luxury housing. As a result of Monaco's increase in prestige, in 1993 it joined the United Nations, with Rainier's heir Prince Albert as head of the Monaco delegation.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} <b>to</b> <b>lessen</b> {{the pressure on}} the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
