500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband, Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. While writing the songs for Like a Prayer, Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed-the-Plow. In the play, she portrayed Karen, a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends. Karen later gets revenge, but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as {{the men who had}} partaken in this bet and exploited her. Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception, which she vented into her lyrics. The result was a set of three songs—"Till Death Do Us Part", [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Oh Father"—where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons. Written with producer Patrick Leonard, in [...] "Oh Father" [...] the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father. Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment, Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind [...] "Oh Father", except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel, her favorite band at that time. She added, [...] " [...] is what the listener thinks it is, all open to interpretation. I just wrote the song, it's up to others to interpret them to mean what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> mean." ...|$|E

While the Baymen valued the Garinagu's agricultural skills, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> submit to European control and help capture refugee slaves. The Baymen began a campaign of misinformation, saying the Garinagu had practices of [...] "devil worshipping" [...] and [...] "baby eating."

25|$|After the Freedom Rides, {{students}} and activists of the Freedom Movement launched {{a series of}} merchant boycotts, sit-ins and protest marches, from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers.

5000|$|On March 19, 2014, Singleton criticized popular studios for [...] "refusing to let African-Americans direct black-themed films". Singleton told an {{audience}} of students at Loyola Marymount University [...] "They ain't letting the black people tell the stories." [...] He also added, [...] "They want black people be what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be. And nobody is man enough to go and say that. They want black people to be who <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be, {{as opposed to what}} they are. The black films now — so-called black films now — they're great. They're great films. But they're just product. They're not moving the bar forward creatively. … When you try to make it homogenized, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don't have anything that's special." ...|$|E

50|$|The 50-year run of marketing-centric, inward facing {{organizational}} structure was over. Gone {{were the days}} of making a product, with businesses telling consumers only the information <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> know {{in order to create}} awareness and drive them into the store, and then making sure the retailer got his product order. Fueled by consumers empowered by globalization and technology, marketing-centric has replaced with consumer-centric, an outward facing organization structure that’s concerned with being there for the consumer wherever, whenever, and with whatever <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to know at any point in their journey to purchase.|$|R

5000|$|Unidos Permanecemos (Spanish for [...] "United We Stand") is a live album by Australian band Hillsong United. It was {{recorded}} in Spain and sung in Spanish. AllMusic gave the album a four star rating out of five, writing that [...] "The fact that the Aussies {{took the time to}} learn the lyrics and enunciate them correctly is proof that <b>they</b> didn't just <b>want</b> to rush out something to appease their ardent Latin followers; <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give the full Hillsong United treatment: big choruses, stadium-sized rockers, and lots of Brit-pop atmospherics ... en español." ...|$|R
5000|$|The songs' lyrics {{were written}} mostly by John [...] "Sean" [...] Byrne, {{and the music}} and vocals were {{recorded}} {{in a very short}} time, so deliberately included two covers of The Who band as filler songs, to complete a brief album of eleven tracks. Band members complained in later interviews that due to the hurried nature of the recording sessions, they never had the chance to shape the songs the way <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sound. [...] The style of the album is fairly basic but effective, set to the rhythms and ways of garage rock.|$|R
500|$|Critics near universally {{took issue}} with the game's controls. Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go, and {{multiple}} reviewers described navigation as [...] "trial and error". Reviewers also found {{that they could not}} always jump when <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to, and one reviewer found that power-ups failed to activate when she <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to.</b> Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again. Because points are subtracted each time Spidy dies, the problems with the control scheme exacerbate {{how difficult it is to}} get enough stars to progress.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the year}} 2008, ABS-CBN {{produced}} its most expensive series [...] Lobo about two opposing {{groups in the}} story—the Luna and the Waya.

They say that the feeling of satisfaction can be achieved even when one parts with something without getting anything tangible in return. An example is when one gives presents to their loved ones simply because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be happy.|$|E

40|$|Public {{discourse}} often portrays Islam as {{the main}} obstacle for Muslim minorities’ integration, paying {{little attention to the}} contextual factors hindering this process. Here, we focus on islamophobia as one destructive factor that hinders the mutual integration between Muslim minority and Western majority members, affecting both groups. In Study 1, the more islamophobic majority members were, the more they expected Muslims to give up their heritage culture and the less <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> integrate. In Study 2, only when Muslims experienced substantial religious discrimination did religious identity negatively relate to national engagement and particularly positively relate to ethnic engagement. Together, the studies suggest that religious prejudice in the form of islamophobia is a major obstacle to Muslims’ integration because it increases the incongruity between majority and minority members’ acculturation attitudes...|$|R

If people believe [...] "things mean just what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> mean", or if people constantly [...] "change the meaning to suit the moment", logical criticism {{is not at all}} effective. Logical criticism assumes that there is a definite, identifiable, discoverable meaning, or at least that something can be proved meaningless (because it lacks any predictable or knowable pattern).|$|E
5000|$|Political {{analyst and}} United Russia member, Sergei Markov, {{said that the}} outcome of this poll was {{predetermined}} because of how much support the Russian people show for Vladimir Putin's policies.

2500|$|As of 1975 about 33% of Lamar's {{students}} were black. Many black parents sent their children <b>to</b> Lamar because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> receive an education superior to that offered at historically black schools. By 1975 black students became members of clubs and the cheerleader corps of Lamar, {{and the student}} council president and [...] "Lady of Lamar" [...] were black. Curtis wrote that black {{students who did not}} wish to associate with whites often do not participate in the social environment while whites who did not wish to associate with blacks were still able to participate in that environment. Some black students emphasized with friends attending other schools who criticized <b>them</b> for going <b>to</b> Lamar that they only attended the school. Curtis wrote that some Lamar white students felt that [...] "going to school with blacks [...] a duty they must perform, a quirk of history they must indulge." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to characterize effective patient care reminder strategies for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence) using short message service (SMS) based on patient perspectives. We conducted a qualitative study with adult PLWHA in a community-based clinic in Lima, Peru using focus groups. 26 HIV-positive individuals participated in four focus groups (20 men, 6 women). The participants expressed positive perceptions towards receiving reminders via SMS, but specified certain characteristics <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have (such as being simple and concise). It was also important that the messages maintained confidentiality and privacy by using coded words or phrases (“Remember, it is the time of your life”) instead of “sensitive” words (HIV or antiretroviral). This study suggests that patients want healthcare SMS that appropriately notify them, deliver a careful crafted message, and assess the context in which they are received...|$|R

Before that, all the Shrek costumes were inside a computer. You can't touch it. For this movie, you could touch the fabric. It was like a toy shop, so exciting." [...] Hui and his team decided to make the monsters in the film look more friendly, humanlike and anthropomorphic—in contrary to typical monsters being vicious and scary—because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> carry emotions and get attached with the audience and the audience to liken the monsters.|$|R

They turned to politics because it was finally the only route to self-preservation.” In the mid-20th century as “firms grew in size and complexity citizens needed to know the market would still {{serve the interests of}} those for whom it claimed to exist.” [...] Callenbach’s Ecotopia targets the fact that many people did not feel that the market or the government were serving them in the way <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to.</b> This book could be interpreted as “a protest against consumerism and materialism, among other aspects of American life." ...|$|R

The unintentional racket of the early recordings had now gone, and the inspired workings of four very clever artists could now be appreciated." [...] He describes that unlike before, [...] "you can recognize the method behind the noise attack.
