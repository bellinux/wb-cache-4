I know I'm not perfect: <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantages {{of being a}} middle-aged man; for I'm not a young man, and I know it. But my code is a simple one, and, I think, a good one. Honor between man and man; fidelity between man and woman; and no can't about this religion or that religion, but an honest belief that things are making for good on the whole.|$|E

5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think its timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically its heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the albums 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the bands thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping {{some of the biggest}} hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes you confess. You always hide {{what youre}} confessing to. <b>Thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why {{you make up}} the story. When I wrote The Shining, for instance, the protagonist of The Shining {{is a man who}} has broken his sons arm, who has a history of child beating, who is beaten himself. And as a young father with two children, I was horrified by my {{occasional}} feelings of real antagonism toward my children. Wont you ever stop? Wont you ever go to bed? And time has given me the idea that probably there are a lot of young fathers and young mothers both who feel very angry, who have angry feelings toward their children. But as somebody who has been raised with the idea that father knows best and Ward Cleaver on Leave It To Beaver, and all this stuff, I would think to myself, Oh, if he doesnt shut up, if he doesnt shut up... So when I wrote this book I wrote a lot of that down and tried to get it out of my system, but it was also a confession. Yes, there are times when I felt very angry toward my children and have even felt as though I could hurt them. Well, my kids are older now. Naomi is fifteen and Joey is thirteen and Owen is eight, and theyre all super kids, and I dont think Ive laid a hand on one of my kids in probably seven years, but there was a time...|$|E
