5|$|The {{species of}} StarCraft have been popular enough to inspire the {{creation}} of several collectable statues and toys based on in-game units. The first series of action figures was released by ToyCom in 2003 and included the <b>Terran</b> heavy infantry firebat with markings similar to some original StarCraft concept art for the firebat and a hydralisk, the Zerg medium assault warrior strain. A series of toys were also made available in 1998, featuring two colour variations of the <b>Terran</b> marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot, the basic Protoss infantry ground unit. In addition, 1/30 scale model kits for the marine and hydralisk were released in 1999 by Academy Hobby Model Kits.s <b>Terran</b> Marine and Zerg Hydralisk| publisher=Starship Modeler| accessdate=2008-04-04}} A second series of collectable statues, which included one based on the <b>Terran</b> ghost, a <b>Terran</b> espionage agent with psychic powers, was in development but {{appears to have been}} cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, Raynor is {{loosely based}} on a {{character}} {{of the same name}} in the 1991 film Rush. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A <b>Terran</b> in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolution against the oppressive <b>Terran</b> Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{setting for}} the series was the 28th century. Humanity has discovered the means of travelling instantaneously through time and space. The capital of Earth, Galaxity, is {{the centre of the}} vast <b>Terran</b> Galactic Empire. Earth itself has become a virtual utopia with most of the population living a life of leisure in a virtual reality dream-state ruled by the benign Technocrats of the First Circle. The Spatio-Temporal Service protects the planets of the <b>Terran</b> Empire and guards against temporal paradoxes caused by rogue time-travellers. Valérian and Laureline are two such spatio-temporal agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the game {{takes place in the}} 24th century when {{humanity}} has discovered interstellar travel through the use of interstellar subspace jump nodes that function {{in the same manner as}} wormholes, allowing it to spread out across the stars and colonise new worlds. Prior to the game beginning, humanity (referred to as Terrans) formed the Galactic <b>Terran</b> Alliance (GTA) as the central power of all of their systems' governments and military, and became engaged in a war over systems and resources against the Vasudans of the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE). By the time the story begins, this war has entered its fourteenth year, as a third species, dubbed Shivans, makes an unprovoked attack on the <b>Terran</b> system of Ross 128. The player, acting as a new <b>Terran</b> pilot in the GTA, is initially involved in the conflict with the PVE before the fights focus on the new species' arrival and subsequent assaults.|$|E
5|$|A second {{series of}} {{collectable}} statues, which included infested Kerrigan, Zeratul and a <b>Terran</b> ghost, was in development but {{appears to have}} been cancelled. However, upon announcement of StarCraft II in 2007, Blizzard released a new collectable statue depicting Wings of Libery mascot character Tychus Findlay.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment {{released}} a free-to-download game demo entitled Loomings, comprising three missions and a tutorial. The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on Battle.net. In addition, the full release of StarCraft included a secondary campaign entitled Enslavers. Consisting of five missions played as both the Terrans and the Protoss, Enslavers {{is set in the}} second campaign in StarCraft and follows the story of a <b>Terran</b> smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg cerebrate and is pursued by both the Protoss and <b>Terran</b> Dominion. Enslavers acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game's level editor, highlighting how to use the features of the program.|$|E
5|$|In a short {{epilogue}} {{after the}} end of Legacy of the Void, Kerrigan calls for Artanis and Raynor's help to confront Amon inside the Void to defeat him once and for all. In the occasion, they meet Ouros, the last of the Xel'Naga who reveals that to confront Amon on equal terms, Kerrigan must inherit Ouros' essence and become a Xel'Naga herself, as Ouros himself is at the last of his strength. Assisted by the Zerg, <b>Terran</b> and Protoss forces, the empowered Kerrigan vanquishes Amon, before disappearing without a trace. Two years later, Kerrigan appears before Raynor in human form and he departs with her to never be heard from again, while the Zerg, the <b>Terran</b> and the Protoss civilizations begin to rebuild in an age of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many <b>Terran</b> units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. <b>Terran</b> buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E
5|$|Jim Raynor is {{the primary}} <b>Terran</b> protagonist and player {{character}} in the StarCraft franchise. Raynor is the ubiquitous character of the series, having participated in all critical plot points and military conflicts in the sector, except one. He is also the only character to have established inter-species alliance.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the <b>Terran</b> military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the <b>Terran</b> colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the <b>Terran</b> soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|Numerous megacorporations {{exist within}} the Federation and TetraCorp {{is one of}} the largest and oldest. Their sister company is Sci-Tek, which {{manufactures}} and supplies most of the technology that the player has access to. Sci-Tek also has blueprints for advanced technologies that the player can purchase. The opening cinematic plays like a corporate recruitment video and at one point is jammed by a <b>Terran</b> male who tells the viewer that TetraCorp has a history of exploiting workers of all races and cultures with low pay and wretched working conditions. The movie is jammed a second time by an Artemian who tells the player that <b>Terran</b> progression was responsible for 68% of all alien mortalities during the past three centuries and that the reason for this high percentage is due to megacorporations such as TetraCorp.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the <b>Terran</b> Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are {{in a constant state}} of conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, <b>terran</b> ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand as one of the three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Brood War {{takes place}} in the StarCraft universe, set around the early 26th century. <b>Terran</b> exiles from Earth have colonized a distant area of the Milky Way galaxy called the Koprulu Sector, having {{established}} several governments. Eventually, a civil war breaks out and ends with the formation of the <b>Terran</b> Dominion. However, humanity soon becomes caught in a war between the Protoss and the Zerg, which culminates at the end of StarCraft with the death of the Zerg leader, the Overmind, on the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Without the Overmind to command, the Zerg rampage mindlessly across Aiur, while the cerebrates—the secondary commanders of the Swarm—attempt to regain control. After the discovery of alien life in the Koprulu Sector, the United Earth Directorate (UED)—the international body governing Earth—decides to send an expeditionary force to secure the sector and prevent the aliens from finding Earth. Brood War begins two days after the conclusion of StarCraft.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of , Raynor participates {{in the defense of}} Korhal from Amon's forces {{alongside}} Artanis. He is later given a psionic call by Kerrigan to aid her and Artanis in a joint <b>Terran</b> Dominion/Zerg Swarm/Protoss invasion of the Void, a realm accessed from the Xel'Naga homeworld of Ulnar, to permanently kill Amon. In the aftermath of the war, Raynor disappears from public view with Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Egon Stetmann is {{a former}} {{scientist}} in <b>Terran</b> Dominion's science project in Tyrador III that involved a cyborg program using New Folsom Prison inmates as experimental lab rats. He tried to protest the experiments, but his former colleagues silenced him. He uses a virus to escape the facility, then goes into hiding at Deadman's Port. Raynor rescued him from attackers, and he became the Hyperion's engineer/scientist and researcher.|$|E
5|$|Ghost {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the StarCraft series. The series is set in a distant part of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector and begins in the year 2499. <b>Terran</b> exiles from Earth are governed by a totalitarian empire, the <b>Terran</b> Dominion, that is opposed by several smaller rebel groups. Two alien races discover humanity: the insectoid Zerg, who begin to invade planets controlled by the Terrans; and the Protoss, an enigmatic race with strong psionic power that attempt to eradicate the Zerg. Ghost takes place four years after the conclusion of , in which the Zerg become the dominant power in the sector and leave both the Protoss and the Dominion in ruins. The game follows the story of Nova, a young ghost agent—a human espionage operative with psychic abilities—in the employ of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|He {{took part}} in the mission to Ehlna. Once at the Alys'aril (the center where Nerazim {{memories}} were preserved) he met Jake Ramsey (the <b>terran</b> carrying Zamara's essence) and Zeratul. The latter made ready to leave. Mohandar told him his place was on Shakuras within the Hierarchy. Zeratul promised to return to Shakuras soon.|$|E
5|$|Mohandar {{tried to}} insist on only sending Nerazim to the sanctuary, but Selendis talked him into {{allowing}} {{a small number of}} templar warriors to accompany the expedition. He agreed, but only if there was no disrespect. Vartanil went along with them, and (much to Mohandar's annoyance) so did Dahl. Mohandar pointed out the protoss were still evaluating her, a <b>terran</b> female.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest also {{challenges}} {{the idea of}} colonialism; the <b>Terran</b> colonists are depicted as being blind {{to the culture of}} the Athsheans, and convinced that they represent a higher form of civilization. Le Guin also {{challenges the}} metaphorical preference in Western cultures for pure light, in contrast to deeper and more complex shadows.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrast}} between the <b>Terran</b> relationship to the planet and the Athshean one is the major example of a larger dialectical structure within the novel, a comparison of opposites. Throughout, the Athsheans are shown as living in balance with their world, while the Terrans despoil it. The Athsheans are shown as a gentle people, in contrast the violence and aggression of the Terrans.|$|E
5|$|The story {{focuses on}} the {{activities}} of the three species {{in a part of the}} Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation, however the computers automating the colony ships malfunction, propelling the <b>Terran</b> colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior and mentality of the Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted <b>Terran</b> colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} StarCraft is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara {{in the wake of the}} Zerg attacks on other <b>Terran</b> worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the <b>Terran</b> population into the <b>Terran</b> Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.|$|E
5|$|Valérian {{was born}} on Earth, in Galaxity, capital of the <b>Terran</b> Galactic Empire in the 28th century. He joined the Spatio-Temporal Service in the year 2713. He has been trained to think that Galaxity is always right – even when he {{receives}} orders that go against his morals he will, reluctantly, follow them. He much prefers {{to be a man}} of action than sitting around pondering what course to take next.|$|E
5|$|Zerg {{buildings}} and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not {{as quickly as}} Protoss shields). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker {{than those of the}} other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some <b>Terran</b> buildings, allowing for the production of special infested <b>Terran</b> units.|$|E
5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk {{is far from the}} force for good when he abandons Kerrigan and the entire population of a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new <b>Terran</b> Dominion. The situation gets no better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle that leads to the fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their <b>Terran,</b> Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E
5|$|Arcturus Mengsk was {{the emperor}} of the <b>Terran</b> Dominion, which {{presided over the}} {{majority}} of the Terrans in the Koprulu Sector. The main antagonist of the series, he is voiced by James Harper and is the primary subject of the novel I, Mengsk. Mengsk is extremely intelligent and is capable as both a strategist and tactician. While Mengsk does not empathize with people well, he is highly skilled at oratory and propaganda and possesses a remarkable ability for manipulating other people.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the <b>Terran</b> Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats to Char, despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been seen or heard from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that <b>Terran</b> logging has rendered barren. Three years later the <b>Terran</b> ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E
5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation. The chrysalis eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and <b>Terran</b> genetics. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a <b>Terran</b> science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Hierarchy to discuss Zamara, a missing preserver. There were none on Shakuras. A <b>terran</b> female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she was subject to protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old enemy of the Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to the judgment of Hierarch Artanis.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant <b>Terran</b> power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{internal}} chronology of the Hainish universe, {{the events of}} The Word for World is Forest occur after The Dispossessed, in which both the ansible and the League of Worlds are unrealised dreams. However, the novel is located prior to Rocannon's World, in which <b>Terran</b> mindspeech {{is seen as a}} distinct possibility. A date of 2368 CE has been suggested by reviewers, although Le Guin provides no direct statement of the date.|$|E
5|$|Nova is the {{daughter}} of one of the highly influential Confederate Old Families; despite having unusually high psionic potential her father prevents her from being taken into the Confederate Ghost Program. However, after her family is murdered by an anti-Confederate resistance movement, Nova flees to the undercity of Tarsonis, where she is forced to work as an organized crime enforcer. Nova is rescued during the Zerg invasion of Tarsonis, and ends up in the possession of the newly formed <b>Terran</b> Dominion, who train her as a ghost. At her request, her past memories are erased.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft begins {{just days}} after the first of these attacks, where the {{predominant}} <b>Terran</b> government, the Confederacy of Man, falls into a state of panic as it comes under attack by both the Zerg and the Protoss, in addition to increasing rebel activity led by Arcturus Mengsk against its rule. The Confederacy eventually succumbs to Mengsk's rebels when they use Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into attacking the Confederate capital, Tarsonis. In the consequent power vacuum, Mengsk crowns himself emperor of a new <b>Terran</b> Dominion. During the assault on Tarsonis, Mengsk allows the Zerg to capture and infest his psychic second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan. This betrayal prompts Mengsk's other commander, Jim Raynor, to desert him with a small army. Having retreated with Kerrigan to their primary hive clusters, the Zerg are assaulted by Protoss forces commanded by Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul. Through assassinating a Zerg cerebrate, Zeratul inadvertently allows the Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion to assimilate the Protoss and gain genetic perfection. Pursued by his own people as a heretic for siding with the dark templar, Tassadar returns with Zeratul to Aiur and with the assistance of Raynor and the templar Fenix, Tassadar launches an attack on the Overmind and ultimately sacrifices himself to kill the creature.|$|E
5|$|The film {{utilized}} fascist imagery throughout, including {{portraying the}} <b>Terran</b> Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those {{worn by the}} SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the film—an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry—was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue ("Violence is the supreme authority!"). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected his own experience in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during WW II.|$|E
5|$|The game {{revolves}} around three species: the Terrans, human exiles from Earth; the Zerg, a super-species of assimilated life forms; and the Protoss, a technologically advanced species with vast mental powers. Wings of Liberty {{focuses on the}} Terrans, while the expansions Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void focus on the Zerg and Protoss, respectively. The game is set {{four years after the}} events of 1998's , and follows the exploits of Jim Raynor as he leads an insurgent group against the autocratic <b>Terran</b> Dominion. The game includes both new and returning characters and locations from the original game.|$|E
