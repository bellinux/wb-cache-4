40|$|Satellites have {{numerous}} uses {{ranging from}} the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> to the observation of the earth’s weather. Depending on the function of a given satellite, the satellite will have a particular orbit that suits it best. The particular function of a satellite may sometimes change, thereby requiring a change in its orbit. Careful planning is a necessity in the alteration of any satellite’s orbit. The complex nature of this planning requires that it be done through both purely analytical techniques and through approximating numerical techniques before {{the transfer of the}} orbits. In this project, implications are found on certain orbital parameters of a periodic trajectory after making reasonable assumptions on some of the other orbital parameters; thereby constructing a periodic trajectory. This newly constructed periodic trajectory is then analyzed using the theory of time-reversal symmetry in dynamical systems. The goal of this analysis is to find a more general method of constructing periodic trajectories and to hopefully make new observations on the interconnectedness of the various orbital parameters. Visual aides, in the form of plots of satellite position versus time, provide an invaluable picture of exactly what the focus of this project is. These plots are obtained using the numerical computing software of MATLAB along with the pertinent Keplerian equations of motion and a few arbitrary initial conditions...|$|E

If they are using VoIP devices without displays and thus cannot execute the “human authentication ” procedure, they are forced to communicate insecurely, or not communicate at all, i. e., this becomes a denial of service attack.

The S-band system utilizes the same techniques asthe existing systems, with the major changes being the inclusion of the voice and data channels.A single carrier frequency is utilized in each direction for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> all trackingand <b>communications</b> data between the spacecraft and ground. The voice and update data aremodulated onto subcarriers and then combined with the ranging data .... This compositeinformation is used to phase-modulate the transmitted carrier frequency. The received and transmitted carrier frequencies are coherently related. This allows measurements of the carrier doppler frequency by the ground station for determination of the radial velocity of the spacecraft.In the transponder the subcarriers are extracted from the RF carrier and detectedto produce the voice and command information. The binary ranging signals, modulateddirectly onto the carrier, are detected by the wide-band phase detector and translated toa video signal.The voice and telemetry data to be transmitted from the spacecraft are modulatedonto subcarriers, combined with the video ranging signals, and used to phase-modulatethe downlink carrier frequency. The transponder transmitter can also be frequencymodulated for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> television information or recorded data instead of ranging signals.The basic USB system has the ability to provide tracking and communications data for twospacecraft simultaneously, provided they are within the beamwidth of the single antenna. Theprimary mode <b>of</b> tracking and <b>communications</b> is through the use of the PM mode of operation.Two sets of frequencies separated by approximately 5 megacycles are used for this purpose ....
