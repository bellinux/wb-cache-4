One of the notables in <b>the</b> <b>Blacker</b> <b>family,</b> Colonel William <b>Blacker,</b> High Sheriff of Armagh, took part in the [...] "Battle of the Diamond" [...] and was a {{founding}} member of the Orange Order. This, and subsequent events like the setting up of a 'provisional' Grand Lodge in the town after the 'voluntary' dissolution of the Order in 1825, led to the town being known as 'The Orange Citadel' and was a center of sectarian strife for two centuries. Many of <b>the</b> <b>Blacker</b> <b>family</b> were soldiers or churchmen.
