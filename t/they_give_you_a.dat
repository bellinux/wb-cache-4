500|$|In February 2011, Cavallari told Access Hollywood {{that the}} cast {{followed}} a [...] "schedule" [...] of events to be filmed {{on a given}} day, adding, [...] "We only filmed The Hills three days a week, and we did three different scenes each day and {{a change of clothes}} to film a specific scene [...] They were pushing it as far as they could go without an actual script... <b>They</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> schedule like, 'You have lunch with Heidi [...] at 3 to talk about the party coming up' or whatever the situation may be". She had earlier commented that she felt viewers [...] "need to understand it's all entertainment" [...] and she [...] "would never put [...] close friends or a real relationship on a show".|$|E

With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales {{selection}} bias is a perceived bias by selectors of the Australian cricket teams towards players from New South Wales. It was exemplified in a quote by former South Australian captain David Hookes who said that, [...] "when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> baggy green {{one in a}} brown paper bag as well to save making two presentations". This is an example of confirmation bias and Hookes' comment came at a time when, especially during the 1980s, there was a public perception that strong performances by non-NSW players were often ignored by the Australian selectors in favour of seemingly under-performing NSW players who were selected for the Test and/or One-Day team. The claims persist {{in spite of the fact}} that no New South Welshman has occupied a position on the National Selection Panel since John Benaud in 1994.|$|E

In October, Gunn confirmed that all five original Guardians and other characters from the original film would return, and the release date was moved up to May 5, 2017. In the following months, Michael Rooker said he would return for the sequel as Yondu, and was looking forward to exploring new areas of the character; Chris Pratt, who played Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the first film, confirmed the sequel would be one of his next projects; and Bradley Cooper expressed interest and excitement when asked if he would return as Rocket for the sequel. Vin Diesel also confirmed he would return as Groot. In March 2015, Gunn revealed that filming would take place in Atlanta, Georgia with [...] "major crew changes" [...] from the first film, and that his brother, Sean Gunn, would return as Kraglin alongside Karen Gillan as Nebula. He also discussed his relationship with Marvel, explained that the company [...] "let me go and do my thing, and I truly listen to their notes and ideas.

Jacob came to me the other day, to make his court; but I told him it was too late, and that it was not my doing. I reckon they will lose it in a week or two. Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and as if we had seen one another yesterday; and Steele and I were very easy, though I writ him lately a biting letter, in answer to one of his, where he desired me to recommend a friend of his to Lord Treasurer.

Well, they clubbed together, four of them, and gave me Tennyson in twelve volumes, illustrated with coloured photographs. They meant kindly, of course. If you suggest a tobacco-pouch <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> blue velvet bag capable of holding about a pound, embroidered with flowers, life-size.
