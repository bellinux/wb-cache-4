With the aim of reviewing the elements that affect the activity, this article presents {{a model for the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> which, generally, there are two forms: the theoretical model for the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods,</b> which represents the goal for the establishment of relations on the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods</b> services market; and the real model for the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> hazardous <b>goods,</b> which represents an adaptation of the theoretical model to the status in a specific localised region. The research, which was conducted as part of the principal author’s Ph. D. thesis, illustrates the exceptional influence of the society changes within a specific country.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> Dangerous <b>Goods</b> {{represents}} a sensitive problem due its congenital high potential risk of causing disaster if an accident occurs. <b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> Dangerous <b>Goods</b> Risk Management systems reduce {{the possibility of}} both accidental disasters and terrorist attacks detecting unusual events and blocking possible threats. Cloud computing can facilitate the development of such kinds of systems thanks to new emerging paradigms and technologies. In this paper, we discuss {{the design of a}} new Message-Oriented Cloud Middleware for Cloud, {{that can be used to}} develop a Cloud-based <b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> Dangerous <b>Goods</b> Risk Management system. More specifically, we investigate issues on <b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> Dangerous <b>Goods,</b> in order to focus the attention on the requirements of the Risk Management system. Then, we describe how to use the Message-Oriented Cloud Middleware for Cloud architecture and the necessary utilities in particular here for supporting <b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> Dangerous <b>Goods.</b> Key words: message oriented middleware, cloud computing, federation, service provisioning, planetary system model...|$|R

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area.

50|$|<b>Transportation</b> <b>of</b> {{dangerous}} <b>goods</b> (hazardous materials) in Canada by road {{is normally}} a provincial jurisdiction.

The result is that all provinces use the federal regulations as their standard within their province; some small variances can exist because of provincial legislation. Creation of the federal regulations was coordinated by Transport Canada. Hazard classifications are based upon the UN Model.|$|R

After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s, Portland became noted for its growing liberal political values, and the city has earned a reputation as a bastion of counterculture, which proceeded into the 21st century.|$|E

This Agreement is the crucial document for <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods</b> both in the Czech Republic and in all states, which acceded to this Agreement. The objective of the paper is assessing the implementation of the European regulations into the regulations of the Czech Republic and mapping the awareness of the public about issues <b>of</b> the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods</b> in road transport. By processing specialized literature about this topic, it was found out that the implementation of the European regulations into the regulations of the Czech Republic was very flexible and fast. On the basis of the quantitative research by means of a questionnaire research among the public and drivers working in the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods</b> it was found out that the public did not have sufficient information about the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods</b> in road transport. On the contrary, drivers transporting dangerous goods are excellently familiar with this issue. With respect {{to the fact that the}} public has not enough information about the <b>transportation</b> <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods,</b> the public administration should provide more pieces of information in the form of leaflets and promotion events. Furthermore, it would be appropriate to include basic information about transporting dangerous substances focused especially on conduct in case of traffic accidents of vehicles transporting dangerous substances into the courses and follow-up training at driving schools.
