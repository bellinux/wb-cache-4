5|$|Space Run is {{developed}} by one-man studio PASSTECH Games, located in Lyon, France. Programmer Sylvain Passot founded the studio in October 2012. Passot has said <b>that</b> <b>Space</b> Run {{was inspired by}} Galaxy Trucker, a boardgame by Vlaada Chvatil, as well as accessible games like Plants vs. Zombies.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant <b>that</b> <b>space</b> was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting <b>that</b> <b>Space</b> Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} non-linear {{versions of}} the classical cotype of Banach <b>spaces.</b> We show <b>that</b> <b>spaces</b> with l. u. st and cotype, and <b>that</b> <b>spaces</b> having Fourier cotype enjoy our non-linear cotype. We apply these concepts to get results on convergence of vector-valued power series in infinite many variables and on ℓ_ 1 -multipliers of vector-valued Dirichlet series.

5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries <b>that</b> <b>space</b> could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{titles in the}} series, the player {{controls}} space-faring bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes after learning <b>that</b> <b>Space</b> Pirates are experimenting with Metroids {{in an attempt to}} duplicate them and use them for their own gain. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. The remake also features new items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels, and a rewritten story which explores Samus's past.|$|E
5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for {{the next}} phase of building, a scheme by Sir John Taylor extending northwards of the main entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and <b>that</b> <b>space</b> is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|<b>That</b> <b>space</b> is {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo images {{also led}} to the {{discovery}} <b>that</b> <b>space</b> weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into <b>that</b> <b>space,</b> the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described <b>that</b> <b>space</b> as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded <b>that</b> <b>space</b> must be heated to a temperature of 5–6K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8K in 1933.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving <b>that</b> <b>space</b> blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, a metric space must be {{translationally}} invariant {{with respect}} to some (finite-dimensional) real vector <b>space.</b> This means <b>that</b> the <b>space</b> itself is an affine <b>space,</b> <b>that</b> the <b>space</b> is flat, not curved, and points do not have different properties, and so any point can be translated to any other point.|$|R

That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his memories and new-found adulation. In return, Archer tries to caution her <b>that</b> <b>space</b> exploration is not as idealistic as she thinks it is. In spite of this, the two manage to rekindle their romance. Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval. Elsewhere, Doctor Phlox learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack, xenophobically blaming all aliens, and Phlox's presence in a bar results in a brawl.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} society was initially {{located at the}} Law Park school building; it later moved {{to the second floor}} of a realty building on Pleasantville Road, and then moved back to the school building after the building was leased by Pace University, occupying <b>that</b> <b>space</b> for eight years. In September 1982, the society moved to the Weber-Tufts building at 1123 Pleasantville Road. On March 21, 2010, the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O'Connor Weber Historical Center in the library building, established as part of the library's expansion. The current president, Karen Smith, heads a board of trustees, members of which have three-year terms with a required one-year recess between terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on <b>that</b> <b>space,</b> the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea <b>that</b> <b>space</b> itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using <b>that</b> <b>space</b> for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half <b>that</b> <b>space,</b> jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E
