40|$|Not much {{attention}} has been paid to the ways in which interpreters are currently being used in the conduct of federal household surveys. Many of these surveys entail personal interviews and are conducted largely by monolingual, Englishspeaking field interviewers. When a monolingual English-speaking field interviewer encounters a household in which the adult members speak little or no English, he or she must rely on someone (an interpreter) who speaks the target language of the respondent for assistance in conducting the interview. Given the increase in the size of the non-English-speaking population in the United States, the ways in which interpreters are used, their training, and their qualifications for playing this role should be of key interest to federal statistical agencies that take pride in the quality of the survey data <b>they</b> <b>collect.</b> This <b>paper</b> discusses the role of interpreters in federal survey interviews, and shows the need to develop guidelines for selecting, training, and evaluating interpreters to ensure the quality of data collected from non-English-speaking households.

40|$|Everyone is {{in favour}} of {{beginning}} teachers having a professional approach to their work. Principals, in particular, {{have a vested interest}} in staffing their schools with graduates who are deemed to be professional and can contribute to the school in a constructive and positive way. But what do principals mean by professionalism? What do they value with respect to being a professional? How do principals decide whether a beginning teacher at a school has a professional approach to teaching? What evidence do <b>they</b> <b>collect?</b> This <b>paper</b> sets out to answer these questions and more. The research is timely because in recent times there has been an increased interest in the area of professional standards for teachers. Much of the standards discourse to date, however, has revolved around 'expert outsiders' attempting to capture on lists what it means to be a competent professional and to impose these views on the 'insiders'. Such an approach ignores the real world of the school and does little to try to understand what happens in that world. This study is an attempt to redress this imbalance. It taps into the rich experience that principals have of teachers and teaching and attempts to unpack some of their understandings of what it means to be a competent beginning professional...|$|R
