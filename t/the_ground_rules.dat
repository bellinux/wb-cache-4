25|$|Beginning {{with the}} Tillman Act of 1907, Congress has imposed {{a growing number}} of {{restrictions}} on elections and campaign financing. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which, {{in the face of a}} First Amendment challenge, set <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for campaign finance legislation, generally disallowing restrictions on expenditures by candidates, but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was unusually}} {{low to the}} playing field, the air-inflated dome {{occasionally}} figured into game action. Major League Baseball had specific ground rules for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the roof over fair ground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in foul ground near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was caught. The dome's roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew prior to a Twins game. Taken at field level, the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof. The roof was high enough that it has never been a concern for events other than baseball.|$|E

500|$|After setting <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rules,</b> Gough and Millar {{conceived}} {{ideas that}} facilitated week-to-week story development.

This was not treated as literally in the pilot and [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] as it was in later episodes. In [...] "Cool", it was [...] "the 'cool' kid literally [...] cool, needing human body heat to stay alive". After several episodes, the writers developed a story that would help establish the show as more than a [...] "villain of the week" [...] series.

500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E

In the second report (1863) they introduced the concept of a coherent system of units whereby units of length, mass and time were identified as [...] "fundamental units" [...] (now known as base units). All other units of measure could be derived (hence derived units) from these base units. The metre, gram and second were chosen as base units.|$|E
500|$|During {{this time}} period, the {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rules</b> of each park rested with the home team. In 1884, team captain and on-field manager Cap Anson decided that balls hit over the fence were to be home runs. [...] Williamson used these short dimensions and new ground rules to set the single-season home run record by hitting 27 in a 112-game season, surpassing the record of 14 set by Harry Stovey the previous year. Of the 27home runs he hit that year, 25 of them were hit at home. [...] This record stood for 35 years until it was broken in 1919 by Babe Ruth, who hit 29 for the Boston Red Sox in a 140-game schedule. [...] The first three of Williamson's 27 home runs came on May 30, {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader against the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson became the first major league baseball player to hit three home runs in one game. [...] During these two record-breaking seasons, his fielding prowess did not recede. He did not lead the league in fielding percentage in either 1883 or 1884, but did lead in assists, capping off a streak of five consecutive years in which he did so, while also leading the league in double plays for the second and third consecutive years.|$|E
