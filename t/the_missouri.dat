5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid {{sturgeon}} larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The recovery was made along a side channel of <b>the</b> <b>Missouri</b> River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning.

5|$|On January 21, 2004, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in <b>the</b> <b>Missouri</b> House of Representatives by State Representatives Rod Jetton and Jason Crowell.

The bill was then sent to the 92nd Missouri General Assembly. It passed <b>the</b> <b>Missouri</b> House of Representatives on March 8, 2004 with a vote of 147–4, <b>the</b> <b>Missouri</b> Senate on May 14, 2004 with a vote of 34–0, and was approved by then-governor Bob Holden on July 9, 2004.

5000|$|<b>The</b> 6th <b>Missouri</b> {{was first}} {{organized}} in 1862 during the American Civil War {{in order to}} serve the Confederate States of America. <b>The</b> former <b>Missouri</b> State Guard battalions under CPT J.W.

They fought {{as a part of}} <b>the</b> Confederate <b>Missouri</b> Brigade in <b>the</b> Battle of Iuka, the Second Battle of Corinth, the Battle of Grand Gulf, and the Battle of Port Gibson. During the Battle of Corinth, <b>the</b> 6th <b>Missouri</b> suffered 214 total casualties. Then at Port Gibson, the Missourians distinguished themselves by advancing ahead of the main battle line in order to recapture lost artillery pieces. During the Siege of Vicksburg on 25 June 1863, COL Erwin was killed in action while attacking the Union Army's 45th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. When the Confederates eventually surrendered at Vicksburg on 4 July 1863, <b>the</b> 6th <b>Missouri</b> suffered more casualties than any other Confederate unit in the campaign. In September 1863, <b>the</b> 6th <b>Missouri</b> consolidated with <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Missouri</b> due to its heavy losses at Vicksburg, and had earned the moniker, [...] "The Bloody Sixth." [...] <b>The</b> new 2/6th <b>Missouri</b> fought valiantly in the Battle of New Hope Church, Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, Battle of Franklin, Battle of Allatoona, and the Battle of Fort Blakely in the closing days of the war. <b>The</b> 2/6th <b>Missouri</b> fought fiercely until the last moment, but eventually were forced to surrender in the end.|$|R

Along with the Lone Tree Ferry Landing in Downtown Omaha, other ferries were established in the Omaha area at Florence, Saratoga and Bellevue.
