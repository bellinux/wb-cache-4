Instead, while en route to Geo, Gold brings her to Seeu's floating castle in Asu and Kura captures and recruits Shiina into his army.|$|E
500|$|The series {{focuses on}} Kaguya Haruyama, a {{teenager}} {{who has lived}} with a Japanese foster family since she was found as an abandoned, amnesiac four-year-old. One night, two men—Idou, a monk, and Seeu, an emotionless prince—appear in her home and fight over her. Gold, Seeu's robot modeled after Kaguya's deceased brother Kagami, brings her to a world parallel to Earth on Seeu's orders. After exploring the world with Gold, she encounters Shiina Mol Bamvivrie who believes Kaguya is the [...] "Girl of Ananai", destined to save {{only one of the}} nine parallel worlds from collision. Shiina explains that nine worlds exist: Ancient, the first civilized world that was mysteriously destroyed; Asu, Seeu's disintegrated world; Eden, present-day Earth; <b>Telene,</b> a small world allied with Geo; Fifth World, a politically neutral world; Geus, a peaceful world under the control of Geo; Geo, the most powerful of the worlds; Asuraitsu, Geo's rival; and the Ninth World, destroyed {{before the start of the}} series.|$|E

50|$|Ring-opening {{metathesis}} polymerization of cycloalkenes {{can produce}} many important petrochemicals; {{this is of}} particular importance in an industrial capacity because synthetic capabilities include linear polymers from inexpensive monomers or polymers with special properties, thus compensating for an additional expense. Some examples of polymers produced on an industrial level through ROMP catalysis are Vestenamer or trans-polyoctenamer which is the metathetical polymer of cyclooctene; Norsorex or polynorbornene is another important ROMP product on the market; <b>Telene</b> and Metton are polydicyclopentadiene products produced in a side reaction of the polymerization of norbornene.|$|E
