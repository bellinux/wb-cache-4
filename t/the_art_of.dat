5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> Parthia proper; <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> the Iranian plateau; and <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the {{treatise}} was a success. At {{the time}} of writing On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power. He secured his father's confidence, thus making succession possible. Kim Jong-il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Opera (1974), On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> the Drama (1988), On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Dance (1990), On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Music (1991), On Fine Art (1991), On Architecture (1991), On Juche Literature (1992), and On Acrobatics.|$|E
5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> war. <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E
