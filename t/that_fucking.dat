The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview <b>that</b> <b>Fucking</b> Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Ruberg of The Village Voice {{wrote in}} a 2008 article <b>that</b> <b>Fucking</b> Machines replaces the {{insecurity}} men feel about vibrators and transform it into a turn-on. The 2008 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History described the aesthetic of the devices on the site as harrowing. In his 2009 book From Aches to Ecstasy, author Arnold P. Abbott commented of the devices used by the site: [...] "Fucking Machines are mechanical marvels {{which had to be}} invented by the Marquis De Sade himself." [...] He observed that some of the machines, [...] "would seem to be replicas to those used during the Inquisition to extract false confessions".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the end of}} the Beatles' {{performing}} career, McCartney sensed unease in {{the band}} and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, [...] "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated <b>that</b> <b>fucking</b> four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men... and [...] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers." ...|$|E

Writer Regina Lynn highlighted the site's emphasis on communication, and Annalee Newitz of AlterNet classed it as part of Porn 2.0. Violet Blue wrote in The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys that it helped popularize the idea of machines aiding in sex acts. The 2008 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History described the aesthetic of the devices as disturbing. Jessica Roy wrote for The New York Observer <b>that</b> <b>Fucking</b> Machines' examples of orgasms were a form of transhumanism. Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon in Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema, titled [...] "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography". She observed, [...] "Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled." ...|$|E

[...] Fox received two additional emails on September 24 and 27, both of which he also posted on Twitter and mocked as being [...] "desperate" [...] and [...] "begging."

He should pay for it. He's got the money." [...] Fox went on to call Trump a [...] "crazy guy" [...] and a [...] "false prophet," [...] and questioned the claim that Trump received 44% of the Hispanic vote in the Republican caucus in Nevada. Trump took to Twitter in response, demanding that Fox apologize for using [...] "the F word while discussing the wall." [...] Fox eventually apologized for the remark, while also asking for Trump to apologize for his remarks about Mexicans and inviting Trump to visit Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get <b>that</b> <b>fucking</b> thing out of here, get out of here and get back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst {{in an interview in}} 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, [...] "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about <b>that</b> <b>fucking</b> guy..." [...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that.

2500|$|Love's {{reckless}} stage presence {{during the}} tour became a media spectacle, drawing press from MTV and other outlets {{due to her}} unpredictable performances. While touring with Sonic Youth, Love got into a physical fight with Kathleen Hanna backstage at a 1995 Lollapalooza festival and punched her in the face. In an August 1995 band interview with Rolling Stone, drummer Patty Schemel formally came out as a lesbian, saying: [...] "It's important. I'm not out there with <b>that</b> <b>fucking</b> pink flag or anything, but it's good for other people who live somewhere else in some small town who feel freaky about being gay to know that there's {{other people who are}} and that it's okay." [...] Toward the end of the tour, the band released their first EP, titled Ask for It, in September 1995; it featured 1991 Peel session recordings, as well as covers of songs by Wipers and The Velvet Underground. The band performed its last show of the year on September 3, 1995 at the Molson Polar Beach Party in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. The concert was a promotional event for the Molson Brewery, and also featured performances by Metallica, Veruca Salt, and Moist.|$|E

If punk was about {{getting rid of}} hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge". Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single [...] "Live Forever" [...] "was written {{in the middle of}} grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' and I was like...'Well, I'm not fucking having that.'

When the heavy metal music blog MetalSucks suspected that the album might actually be a double album based on a reader's news tip about an early Amazon.com listing, they reached out to Turner for verification who then blatantly denied the question. Turner said: [...] "Not sure what's going on over at Amazon... All I {{can think of is}} that there were alternate versions of the art and track sequence/track titles {{when we were in the}} developmental stages of the album and that's confusing things. I sent them around to Profound Lore and the band members and the Japanese label... sooo??? Also since there are 3 labels involved in putting out the record (SIGE, Profound Lore, Daymare) maybe <b>that's</b> <b>fucking</b> things up?
