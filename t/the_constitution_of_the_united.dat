By {{the late}} 5th century BC, <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Kingdom {{had given way}} to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Republic.

By 300 AD, <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire had been reformed into <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Roman Empire.

5|$|The Virginia Secession Ordinance was to “repeal the {{ratification}} of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America, by the State of Virginia.” Two {{days after the}} secession resolution and {{a month before the}} referendum, the Confederate flag was raised over Virginia's capitol building, a delegation was sent to vote in the Confederate Congress, state militias were activated and a Confederate army was invited to occupy Richmond. Though the ballots from Unionist counties were lost, the total referendum votes counted numbered more than that of the 1860 presidential election by including men voting viva voce aloud in Confederate army camps, approving secession by 128,884 to 32,134.|$|E
