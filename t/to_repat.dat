40|$|Estimates {{of world}} {{regional}} potentials of the sustainable use of biomass for energy uses {{through the year}} 2050 are presented. The estimated potentials are consistent with scenarios of agricultural production and land use developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria. They thus avoid inconsistent land use, in particular conflicts between the agricultural and bioenergy land use. As an illustration of {{the circumstances under which}} a large part of this potential could be used in practice, a global energy scenario with high economic growth and low greenhouse gas emissions, developed by IIASA and the World Energy Council is summarized. In that scenario, bioenergy supplies 15 % of global primary energy by 2050. Our estimation method is transparent and reproducible. A computer program <b>to</b> <b>repat</b> the calculation of the estimates with possibly changed assumptions is available on request...|$|E
40|$|Jorgensen {{was sentenced}} to {{transportation}} for life. He arrived in Van Diemen's Land in April 1826. He received a ticket-of-leave in June 1827 and, after a short-lived convict-clerkship, {{was assigned to the}} Van Diemen's Land Co. and sent to explore parts of the north and north-west of the island. Transcribed copies of the diaries of J. Jorgensen, include, Journey <b>to</b> Ouse Plateau, <b>Repat</b> of Jorgensen <b>to</b> V. D. L. Co. on route between Hobart and Circular Head, and Journal kept while exploring from Circular Head to the Pieman River, 1826 - 7. From the Meston Papers, Private Deposit M. 11 / 3 -...|$|R
40|$|Insect larvae {{spend most}} of their time eating and the {{digestive}} tract is the most crucial barrier for the entrance of many pathogens. In our study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to compare Spodoptera exigua midgut gene expression between larvae exposed to the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry 1 Ca toxin and non-exposed insects. Based on the SSH results, full cDNA sequences coding for four homologous proteins were obtained. Quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed the increased expression of the genes coding for these proteins after exposure to different B. thuringiensis toxins as well as after infection with baculovirus. The proteins were named REPAT after their increased expression in Response <b>to</b> Pathogen. <b>REPAT</b> 1, a member of this family, was recombinantly expressed using the baculovirus expression system, revealing the glycosylated nature of the protein. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing REPAT 1 were used to infect larvae from S. exigua, showing that expression of REPAT 1 was reducing the virulence of baculovirus to the infected larvae. Together, these results suggest a role for REPAT 1 in mitigating pathological effects...|$|R
