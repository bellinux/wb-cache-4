Gene probe analyses of DNA extracted from the dichlormethane-degrading wastewater indicated the presence of the gene coding for dichloromethane dehalogenase, indicating the genetic basis for the dechlorination activity observed. These studies indicate that methanogenic bacteria are the organisms responsible for the chloroform dechlorination.

Nineteen descriptors, some established and others developed during this study, were used as inputs in a multiple linear regression model. The final model, calibrated using five-way leave-many-out cross 28 validation, contains three descriptors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are {{biodegradable}} polyesters accumulated intracellularly {{as energy}} resources by bacterial {{species such as}} Pseudomonas putida. The most popular method for PHA recovery is solvent extraction using <b>trichloromethane</b> (<b>chloroform)</b> and methyl alcohol (methanol). An alternative method is enzymatic treatment, which eliminates usage of these hazardous solvents. This research focuses on the characterization of PHAs recovered by enzymatic treatments and ultrafiltration. Comparisons are made with conventional solvent extracted PHA. RESULTS: The purity of PHA in water suspension recovered by enzymatic treatments as analyzed by gas chromatography was 92. 6. Enzymatically recovered PHA was comparable to conventional solvent-extracted PHA, which had a purity of 95. 5. PHA was further characterized for functional group analysis, structural composition analysis and molecular weight determination. It {{was found that the}} molecular weight of the PHA recovered by enzymatic treatment was less than solvent-extracted PHA, probably due to degradation of the lipopolysaccharide layer. However, functional group and structural composition analyses showed similar results for PHA recovered by both methods. CONCLUSION: PHAs recovered through enzymatic digestion treatment have good comparability with solvent-extracted PHAs. Thus enzymatic digestion has great potential as an alternative recovery method.

40|$|Chemical {{disinfection}} {{of water}} supplies brings significant public health benefits by reducing microbial contamination. The process can however, {{result in the}} formation of toxic compounds through interactions between disinfectants and organic material in the source water. These new compounds are termed disinfection by-products (DBPs). The most common are the trihalomethanes (THMs) such as <b>trichloromethane</b> (<b>chloroform),</b> dichlorobromomethane, chlorodibromomethane and tribromomethane (bromoform); these are commonly reported as a single value for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs). Analysis of DBPs is commonly performed via time- and solvent-intensive sample preparation techniques such as liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction. In this study, a method using headspace gas chromatography with micro-electron capture detection was developed and applied for the analysis of THMs in drinking and recycled waters from across Melbourne (Victoria, Australia). The method allowed almost complete removal of the sample preparation step whilst maintaining trace level detection limits (> 1 ppb). All drinking water samples had TTHM concentrations below the Australian regulatory limit of 250 µg/L but some were above the U. S. EPA limit of 60 µg/L. The highest TTHM concentration was 67. 2 µg/L and lowest 22. 9 µg/L. For recycled water, samples taken directly from treatment plants held significantly higher concentrations (153. 2 µg/L TTHM) compared to samples from final use locations (4. 9 - 9. 3 µg/L) ...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of three}} studies in New Jersey {{demonstrate}} that {{analysis of samples}} collected throughout the hydrologic cycle can improve understanding {{of the sources of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient ground water. Results of the first study indicate that atmospheric concentrations of methyl-tert butyl ether (MTBE) are sufficiently high to cause detection in ground water, whereas atmospheric concentrations of the chlorinated VOCs <b>trichloromethane</b> (<b>chloroform),</b> 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA), and tetrachloroethene (PCE) are not. Results of analysis of unsaturated-zone gas and ground-water samples indicate that point sources of MTBE, such as spills or infiltration of urban runoff, are also prevalent and that these are the only possible sources of the chlorinated compounds. In the second study, VOC concentrations in three ground-water monitoring networks in a surficial aquifer were compared. Although it was anticipated that deeper ground water from the public supply wells would be associated with less frequent detections and lower concentrations of VOCs than water from the shallower observation wells, the opposite was found for many chlorinated VOCs. The integration of chlorinated VOCs from multiple point sources within the larger contributing areas of the public supply wells may explain this result. Chloroform, however, is detected frequently throughout the ground-water- monitoring network, indicating that its sources are widespread...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of selected disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during the chlorination of breakfast, Earl Grey and green tea, and from instant and filter coffee. Eight model compounds representing the organics in tea and coffee were also tested. Initially, experiments using water pre-spiked with chlorine demonstrated chlorine concentrations of 1 – 19 mg L− 1 were reduced by 5 – 19 % through boiling in a kettle. The <b>chloroform</b> (<b>trichloromethane)</b> yield of 47. 6 ± 0. 3 % from chlorination of catechin hydrate is high compared with surrogates of drinking water natural organic matter (NOM). Chloroform yields from tea chlorinated under formation potential conditions were similar to reactive drinking water NOM isolates and higher than from coffee. Chloroform generated during the preparation of tea reached 30 – 43 μg L− 1 at the highest chlorine dose of 14. 2 mg L− 1. Under the same conditions no chloroform was detected in instant coffee, whereas up to 3 μg L− 1 chloroform was generated from filter coffee. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for DBP formation when tea is prepared in water containing elevated chlorine concentrations, such as following point-of-use treatment. Conversely, chloroform concentrations in tea prepared with water containing 1 mg L− 1 chlorine were ≤ 4 μg L− 1 and therefore trichloromethane (THM) concentrations in tea made using municipal tap water {{are likely to be}} insignificant...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} partitioning method (EqP-method) {{can be used}} {{to derive}} environmental quality standards (like the Maximum Permissible Concentration or the intervention value) for soil or sediment, from aquatic toxicity data and a soil/water or sediment/water partitioning coefficient. The validity of the use of the EqP-method for this purpose can be studied by the comparison of aquatic with terrestrial toxicity data. For 12 organic substances and for 8 metals sufficient data were available in the literature to make this comparison. The toxicity and sorption data for water and soil were taken from the reports that are used to derive environmental quality standards in the Netherlands. The EC 50 (Effect Concentration 50 %) or No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) values (expressed in 4 g/L) for water organisms were compared with the EC 50 or NOEC values (expressed in mg/kg) for soil organisms or soil processes using selected sorption constants (expressed in L/kg). For copper, chlorpyrifos, atrazine and for the effect of pentachlorophenol or cadmium on soil processes, the terrestrial toxicity data (EC 50 or NOEC) were significantly higher compared to the aquatic toxicity data. For 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol, trichloroethene, chromium III, arsenic and lead the aquatic toxicity data were significantly higher. Some of these statistically significant differences might be attributed to the selection of the sorption constants, {{but in the case of}} chlorpyrifos and trichloroethene this was not the case. The significantly lower EC 50 values of <b>chloroform</b> (<b>trichloromethane)</b> for processes in sediment compared to animal species in water could also not be explained by the selection of the sorption constant. For chlorpyrifos, trichloroethene and chloroform, these significant differences might be attributed to the selection of soil or sediment toxicity tests. These significant differences indicate that the EqP-method is not a scientifically validated method to derive environmental quality standards but can only be regarded as an estimation routine, which can give a significant over-or underestimation. The EqP-method is used to estimate Hazardous Concentration 5 % (HC 5) values for soil or sediment using aquatic toxicity data. These HC 5 values were in 5 % of the cases more than a factor 20 higher than the corresponding HC 5 values that were derived directly using toxicity tests with soil organisms for the 12 organic substances and 8 metals. This factor 20 indicates that the EqP-method can not be used for an accurate determination of soil or sediment HC 5 values, but is only suited for a rough estimation. When a risk assessor is confronted with a limited number of terrestrial toxicity data and a much larger number of aquatic toxicity data, together with a reliable soil/water partitioning coefficient. There is a choice between the use of the terrestrial data, or the use of the EqP-method, for a rough estimation of a soil quality standard. The recommendations give detailed advice for this choice in order to minimize the often very large uncertainty in the estimation of a soil quality standard...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trichloromethane</b> (<b>chloroform)</b> {{is widely}} used for {{industrial}} chemical synthesis and also as an organic solvent in laboratories or ingredient of pesticides. Sudden death resulted from cardiac arrhythmias {{has been reported in}} clinic with acute trichloromethane intoxication. The present study was designed to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenic effect (cardiac toxicity) of trichloromethane in isolated rat hearts and ventricular myocytes and HEK 293 cells stably expressing human Nav 1. 5, HCN 2, or hERG channel using conventional electrophysiological approaches. It was found that trichloromethane (5 mM) induced bradycardia and atrial-ventricular conduction blockade or ventricular fibrillation, and inhibited cardiac contractile function in isolated rat hearts. It shortened action potential duration (APD) in isolated rat ventricular myocytes, and increased the threshold current for triggering action potential, but had no effect on the inward rectifier K + current I K 1. However, trichloromethane significantly inhibited the L-type calcium current I Ca. L and the transient outward potassium current I to in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 s: 1. 01 and 2. 4 mM, respectively). In HEK 293 cells stably expressing cardiac ion channel genes, trichloromethane reduced hNav 1. 5, HCN 2, and hERG currents with IC 50 s of 8. 2, 3. 3, and 4. 0 mM, respectively. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} trichloromethane can induce bradycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and the arrhythmogenic effect of trichloromethane is related to the inhibition of multiple ionic currents including I Ca.

40|$|International audienceContrary to the {{understanding}} of the emissions and chemical behavior of halocarbons from anthropogenic sources (e. g. CFCs and HCFCs), the biogeochemistry of naturally emitted halocarbons is still poorly understood. We present measurements of chloromethane (methyl chloride, CH 3 Cl), <b>trichloromethane</b> (<b>chloroform,</b> CHCl 3), dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2), and tetrachloroethylene (C 2 Cl 4) from air samples taken over the Surinam rainforest during the 1998 LBA/CLAIRE campaign. The samples were collected in stainless steel canisters on-board a Cessna Citation jet aircraft and analyzed in the laboratory using a gas chromatograph equipped with FID and ECD. The chlorocarbons we studied have atmospheric lifetimes of 1 year or less, and appear to have significant emissions from natural sources including oceans, soils and vegetations, as well as biomass burning. These sources are primarily concentrated in the tropics (30 º N- 30 º S). We detected an increase as a function of latitude of methyl chloride, chloroform, and tetrachloroethylene mixing ratios, in pristine air masses advected from the Atlantic Ocean toward the central Amazon. In the absence of significant biomass burning sources, we attribute this increase to biogenic emissions from the Surinam rainforest. From our measurements, we deduce fluxes from the Surinam rainforest of 7. 6 ± 1. 8 ?g CH 3 Cl m ? 2 h ? 1, 1. 11 ± 0. 08 g CHCl 3 ?m ? 2 h ? 1, and 0. 36 ± 0. 07 ?g C 2 Cl 4 m ? 2 h ? 1. Extrapolated to a global scale, our emission estimates suggest a large potential source of 2 Tg CH 3 Cl yr ? 1 from tropical forests, which could account for the net budget discrepancy (underestimation of sources), as indicated previously. In addition, our estimates suggest a potential emission of 57 ± 17 Gg C 2 C 4 yr ? 1 from tropical forest soils, equal to half of the currently missing C 2 Cl 4 sources. We hypothesize that the extensive deforestation over the last two decades relates to the observed global downward trend of atmospheric methyl chloride...|$|E
