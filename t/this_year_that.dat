The enormous power that fell into his hands was naturally looked upon with serious alarm by the Regent and her minister. Condé's birth and military renown placed him {{at the head of}} the French nobility, but, added to that, the family of which he was now chief was both enormously rich and master of a large part of France. Condé himself held Burgundy, Berry and the marches of Lorraine, as well as other less important territory. His brother, the Prince de Conti held Champagne, and his brother-in-law, Longueville, Normandy.|$|E

25|$|With the {{completion}} of the ground in 1937, the Bombay Pentangular tournament was moved to the Brabourne from the Bombay Gymkhana. It was in <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> the Rest entered the competition as the fifth team; Hindus, however, withdrew their team after a dispute over the seating allocation. The stadium was packed to capacity during all pentangular matches. The battle between Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare in 1943–44 saw the record for the highest individual score being bettered three times {{in the first week of}} December, ending with Hazare's 309 run contribution to Rest's total of 387 all out in the final. In the Ranji match against Maharashtra that began on the last day of the year, Merchant improved upon it with an innings of 359 not out which still stands as the highest score made on the ground. In the 1944–45 final of the Pentangular, Muslims chased 298 to defeat the Hindus by one wicket. The Pentangular tournament was discontinued after the 1946–47 season.|$|E

A team comprising Popkova, Lyudmila Zharkova, Galina Bukharina and Lyudmila Samotyosova ran even faster in the Olympic final, clocking 43.41seconds, yet this was only enough for the bronze as teams from both the United States and Cuba also went under the previous world record mark.

25|$|As mentioned, {{the heart}} of Walkerville was Walker’s distilling business, “Hiram Walker and Sons” which was {{established}} in 1858. Walker’s business created {{an expansion of the}} town that included, malt houses, cooperage, copper shop, planning mill, lumber yard, brick yard, and a ferry between Walkerville and Detroit. The trip from his house in Detroit to his businesses in Walkerville took approximately an hour and a half. Due to this, Walker decided to invest in a ferry that would travel between Detroit and Walkerville as to save time and be of assistance to the public. In 1880 he finally decided to rent a ferry that would travel from Detroit and Walkerville. The ferry he would lease was called “The Essex” which was a steam ship built in, 1858 in Walkerville. He installed a dock system on his land in Walkerville that would allow people to board the ferry. in its beginnings the ferry was not very useful for the people of Walkerville as it mainly served as a personal transportation service for Walker himself. It did not follow a set schedule and did not make very many trips on any given day. However, in the following year of 1881, a set schedule was developed and the ferry as a public service began. It was also during <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> another ferry, called “Ariel”, replaced “The Essex” due to the termination of the lease.|$|E
25|$|The Medici bank's {{founding}} {{is usually}} dated to 1397, {{since it was}} <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici separated his bank from his nephew Averardo's bank (which had effectively been acting as a branch in Rome), and moved his small bank from Rome to Florence. The branch in Rome was entrusted to Benedetto, and Giovanni took on Gentile di Baldassare Buoni (13711427) as a partner. They raised 10,000 gold florins and began operating in Florence, though Gentile soon left the firm. This move had certain advantages for a bank, inasmuch as the predominant large banks of the 14th century which were based in Florencethe Bardi, Acciaioli, Peruzzihad met with problems, and saw their places usurped by the Alberti, who were just large enough to capture the Catholic Church's business. But the Alberti firm split over internecine quarrels, and the clan was banished from Florence in 1382 (though they {{would be allowed to}} return in 1434), creating yet another void. Giovanni's choice proved to be prescient, especially since what Florence was lacking was a good port on the Mediterraneanwhich it would obtain in 1406 with the conquest of Pisa and its Porto Pisano. A further advantage was that it was much easier to invest a bank's capital in Florence than in Rome, and because of the Holy See's deposits (obtained through Giovanni's long contacts with them), the bank had a fair amount of capital to invest in other ventures.|$|E

500|$|Outside his Cumbrian principality and the {{southern}} fringe of Scotland-proper, David exercised little power in the 1120s, and {{in the words of}} Richard Oram, was [...] "king of Scots in little more than name". He was probably in that part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130. However, he was at the court of Henry in 1126 and in early 1127, and returned to Henry's court in 1130, serving as a judge at Woodstock for the treason trial of Geoffrey de Clinton.

500|$|Although Smart {{seemed to}} turn his life around at Pembroke, he slowly {{abandoned}} the college for London. During 1749, Smart listed himself on Pembroke's [...] "Liber Absentiae" [...] and would occasionally return to Pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750. Because {{of his relationship with}} those at Pembroke, he was allowed to keep his name in the college's records, which allowed him to participate and be charged {{as a member of the}} college. By 1750 he was living near St. James's Park and was busy familiarising himself with Grub Street. It was <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Smart developed a business relationship with John Newbery. It is unknown how Smart and Newbery met, but Smart's daughter claimed Charles Burney introduced the two. Newbery was looking for a contributory to his The Midwife and The Student magazines, and it is possible that Smart's winning of Cambridge's [...] "Seatonian Prize" [...] on 25 March 1750 brought his poetic abilities to Newbery's attention.|$|E

He reportedly carried out his duties as consul well, although he was prone to violence and earned the nickname [...] "Castor" [...] from fighting an equestrian. There was also an incident at a theater between the Praetorians and claqueurs ("actors") in which Drusus reportedly sided with the actors, preventing the Praetorian Guard from punishing unruly actors. In Annals 1.77, Tacitus says the unruly behavior of actors and the crowds were later addressed by the Senate which passed measures allowing the praetors to punish riotous spectators. Such were his excesses that Tiberius decided to make him governor of Illyricum the following year, both to give him experience in war and bolster his popularity with the troops - perhaps also to keep {{him away from the}} indulgences of city life.|$|E
