5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E

They certainly think they can do a better job than their MP. Everyone has opinions, and that was how the manifesto show was born. Instead of politicians telling us what we should do, it should be the other way round." ...|$|R

25|$|The Melians {{argue that}} they are a neutral city and not an enemy, so Athens has no need to conquer them. The Athenians counter that if they accept Melos' {{neutrality}} and independence, they would look weak: Their subjects would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> left Melos alone because they were not strong enough to conquer it.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{characteristic}} of the Fantastic Lava Beds {{is the presence of}} anomalous quartz crystal xenocrysts (foreign bodies in igneous rock).

25|$|Takahē were {{assumed to}} be extinct but were rediscovered by Geoffrey Orbell near Lake Te Anau in the Murchison Mountains, South Island, New Zealand on 20 November 1948. Takahē were at one time present {{throughout}} this island country, but for several reasons ceased to be found, which made many <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were wiped out. Many reasons were cited {{for the failure of}} this flightless bird. There are two significant periods when takahē numbers declined: pre-European and post-European arrival.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{people began}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were too busy to heed every crime and abuse that {{happened}} in their society.

So, they appointed someone to rectify what is right and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice.|$|E
25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add to happiness. This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.|$|E

25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain {{the killing of the}} students. The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism and radicalism, {{but it is not clear}} that they were targeted for their political beliefs. Some <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may have angered Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money. Others believe there may be a link between the students' disappearance and a speech given by the wife of Iguala's mayor on the day of the clashes. She was speaking to local dignitaries when the students were protesting in Iguala and some believe they may have been targeted because it was feared they could disrupt the event.|$|E

I certainly would love to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> actually reached the summit of Everest.

When Geet's {{grandfather}} (Dara Singh) sees them both together, he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a couple and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in love with each other. But no one seems to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elope with Anshuman as she is sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways.|$|R
25|$|While mikoshi-nyūdō {{depicted}} as a yōkai with giant characteristics exists, the mikoshi-nyūdō that {{brings to mind the}} long-necked rokurokubi depicted in play images in the Edo period are certainly not strange. There are those who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are related to the rokurokubi, and since the rokurokubi of legends are frequently female, they are sometimes pointed out as examples of male rokurokubi. The length of its neck has been exaggerated over the passage of eras, and in the late Edo period, it has become standard for its neck to be long and thin, and for its face to have three eyes. In many kusazōshi that had a theme on yōkai, they are also {{depicted as}} having a characteristic long neck, and from having an appearance with such impact, they almost always appear as the chief yōkai.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} fierce fights were {{underway}} at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent {{against each other}} under claims {{that they were going}} to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who seemed to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were loyal to Ceausescu's regime.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the typological {{similarity}} {{of the structures}} and the relatively short distance between them (ideal for visual communication), has led some to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{on opposite sides of}} the frontier line between the Kingdoms of León and Castile (in Salamanca there is a town names Zorita de la Frontera ("Zorita on the Border") in memory of those times). These fortresses were reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries due to conflicts between the two kingdoms; but it appears that they are more plentiful on the Castilian side (near the Trabancos) than on the Leonese side (near the River Guareña). This has been seen as indicative of a certain independence on the part of the militia of the Community of Medina del Campo and surrounding areas, which was thereby forced to defend itself without outside help, while the Leonese side would have been able to rely on the help of Royal troops, and the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, billeted in Castronuño and Torrecilla de la Orden.|$|E
