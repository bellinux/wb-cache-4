50|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>edge</b> {{damage and}} polish {{are two major}} sources for {{information}} about the use of a tool. Variations of polish type are formed depending on how a <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> is used functionally, on the type(s) of material, and duration of use.|$|E
50|$|Type II chips {{form when}} a {{shearing}} force {{is produced by}} the wedge of the tool angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from {{the apex of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>edge,</b> diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form from intermediate cutting angles.|$|E
30|$|Besides that, {{when the}} UCT is {{comparable}} to the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> on machined surface quality could no longer be neglected. For instance, the increased <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius would increase the surface roughness [17], and the spring back of the machined material affected by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> is thought to be responsible of the machined surface roughness [18]. At the <b>tool</b> <b>edge,</b> there is a region or point where the material tends to separate [19, 20]. The point is thought to be the stagnation point [14, 15, 21], and the region is the stagnation region where the material flow velocity is almost zero [22]. The material above the stagnation point or region is removed to form the chip. The material below them is pressed down to the flank face of cutting tool to form the machined surface. The amount of pressed material which is determined by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, is responsible of the side flow and further affects the generated surface quality. However, the influence of cutting tool geometry on side flow still lacks deep investigations in nano-cutting.|$|E
30|$|The {{measured}} strain fields {{displayed a}} thin band of large strain between the <b>tool</b> <b>edges.</b> Shearing with two clamps {{resulted in a}} symmetric strain band whereas there was an extended area with large strains around the tool at the unclamped side when shearing with one clamp. Furthermore, one or two cracks were visible {{on most of the}} samples close to the <b>tool</b> <b>edges</b> well before final fracture.|$|R

30|$|Besides that, {{when the}} UCT is {{comparable}} to the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, the tool could no longer be simplified as a sharp edge. The interactions between the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the materials make the material deform in different ways. For instance, the shearing plane which used to be a plane [11 – 13] extends to a shearing zone [14, 15]. Woon et al. [15] systematically investigate the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius on the material deformation behavior {{in a wide range of}} UCT. In nano-cutting process, Fang et al. [16, 17] propose that the materials are extruded in front of the cutting tool when the UCT is much less than <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius. Woon et al. [18] also found an extrusion-like material deformation behavior at a critical combination of UCT and <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [18]. Simoneau et al. [19] found the chip formation changes from the shearing to a quasi-shear-extrusion mechanism with a decrease of UCT. When UCT decrease to a critical value, the material cannot remove stably or just no formation of chip. The threshold value is defined as the minimum UCT. It is a key parameter which strongly relates to the material separation mechanisms in front of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and determines the machined surface quality. Two major mechanisms have been proposed in describing the material separation at the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [20, 21]. One is based on the existence of stagnation point at the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [22], another one is based on the formation of stagnation region in which the material flow velocity is almost zero [23]. The stagnation point or the tip of stagnation region is where the workpiece material starts to split into two parts to form the chip or the machined surface. The material deformation mechanism influenced by <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> would further affect the generated surface quality. The cutting edge with large edge radius results in higher average surface roughness values than that with small edge radius [24], and the effect of the cutting edge radius on the surface roughness decreased with an increase in workpiece hardness. The spring back of the machined material which influences the surface roughness is also affected by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [25].|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. The {{side flow}} is formed because the {{material}} at {{or under the}} stagnation region is extruded by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> to flow {{to the side of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The side flow is influenced by the position of stagnation region. Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow and further deteriorate the machined surface quality.|$|E
30|$|When {{the cutting}} {{direction}} is { 100 }< 001 >, no shearing plane is formed {{in front of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> For the UCT of 0.45 and 0.7  nm which is {{less than or equal to}} separation height, workpiece surface is firstly pressed down by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> in elastic deformation. Then, the upper layer, usually the first layer, of the workpiece material is removed by the cutting tool in an extrusion way. The rest part of the materials flow to the flank face of the cutting tool experience the elastic-plastic deformation and form the machined surface. For the UCT of 0.95  nm which is larger than separation height, more materials are removed to form the chip. However, no shearing plane forms {{in front of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the materials are still removed by extruding. Similar results obtain at cutting direction of { 100 }< 011 >{ 110 }< 1 - 10 > and { 111 } < 11 - 2 >. Minor difference in the cutting processes is that the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> rubs on the workpiece material surface and almost no materials are removed, when the UCT is less than the separation height at these three cutting directions. In rubbing mechanism, the workpiece material experiences elastic-plastic deformation due to the interaction with the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and flank face, which, to some extent, affects the generated surface. For the cutting direction of { 110 }< 001 > whose separation height is negative, the upper layer materials could be removed even the UCT is 0.1  nm. This is because the materials in front of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> firstly pile up by shearing mechanism and then are extruded or secondly sheared by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The material could also be removed when the UCT is 0.25  nm for the cutting direction of { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, as shown in Fig.  13. Materials are extruded up at a distance of several nanometers away from the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The distance of the materials starting to be extruded increases with the cutting distance.|$|E
40|$|In {{discussions of}} Paleolithic hominin {{behavior}} {{it is often}} assumed that cut marks are an unwanted byproduct of butchery activities, and that their production causes the dulling of stone <b>tool</b> <b>edges.</b> It is also presumed that Paleolithic butchers would have refrained from making cut marks to extend the use life of their tools. We {{conducted a series of}} butchery experiments designed to test the hypothesis that cut marks affect the use life of tools. Results suggest cut marks are not associated with edge attrition of simple flake tools, and therefore it is unlikely that Paleolithic butchers would have avoided contact between bone surfaces and <b>tool</b> <b>edges.</b> Edge attrition is, however, significantly greater during skinning and disarticulation than during defleshing. This suggests that skinning and disarticulation activities would require more <b>tool</b> <b>edges</b> relative to butchery events focused purely on defleshing. Differences between the number of cut-marked bones relative to the number of stone artifacts deposited at taphonomically comparable archaeological localities may be explicable in terms of different types of butchery activities conducted there, rather than strictly the timing of carcass access by hominins. Archaeological localities with higher artifact discard rates relative to raw material availability may represent an emphasis on activities associated with higher edge attrition (e. g. skinning or disarticulation) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the flank side of the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> that has large affect on machined surface integrity is measured using two-color pyrometer with a fused fiber coupler. The infrared rays radiated from the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> are accepted by an optical fiber, and separated to two optical fibers at the fused fiber coupler. Each fiber leads the infrared ray, respectively, to two infrared detectors with different characteristic of spectral sensitivity. Temperature is obtained by calculating {{the ratio of the}} output voltage from these two detectors. A CBN tool (CBN content : 60 volume percent, density : 3000 kg/mm 2) is used as the cutting tool. Annealed steel (S 45 C), bearing steel (SUJ 2), and quenched steel (S 55 C) are used as the cutting materials to investigate their affect on the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> temperature.

In micromachining, the uncut chip {{thickness}} {{is comparable to}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, and chip won’t be generated if the uncut {{chip thickness}} is less than a critical value, besides that, the minimum uncut chip thickness affect many factors such as the cutting force, the chip’s modality, the cutting surface quality, etc. In this paper, a geometric model is developed to predict the minimum uncut chip thickness values.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was developed in}} order to predict the surface roughness before machining the part. This model {{is based on the}} geometric tool-part intersection and allows defining the surface topography of the part {{as a function of the}} feed and of the radii of the <b>tool</b> <b>edges.</b> In this first study the problem of runout, i. e. differences between the radii of the different <b>tool</b> <b>edges,</b> is analyzed.

It was observed that the obtained values of average roughness Ra do not follow a normal distribution even though the values of the radii were randomly taken according to a normal law.
