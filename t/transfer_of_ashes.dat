The large public place through which the procession paraded was then for the first time called Ariosto Square. The author of the Orlando is jealously claimed as the Homer, not of Italy but Ferrara.[589] The mother of Ariosto was of Reggio, and the house in which he was born is carefully distinguished by a tablet with these words: [...] "Qui nacque Ludovico Ariosto il giorno 8. di Settembre dell' anno 1474."

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work {{is dedicated to}} development of scientific-technical bases of production and application of concrete on the basis <b>of</b> <b>ashes</b> <b>of</b> thermal power plants (TPP). Methodology. The properties <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash,</b> {{as well as the}} peculiarities of its behavior in a concrete mix as a fine aggregate, have been studied. It is shown that the hydrolysis and hydration of cement occur in the active environment <b>of</b> <b>ash,</b> which has a huge specific surface area. This significantly affects the course of these processes {{and the quality of the}} concrete produced. A new technology <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> TPP for preparation of concrete mixes is offered. Vibrated and vibrovacuumized concretes of optimum composition from slag and ash, as well as from granite crushed stone and ash, are tested. The chara-cteristics of ordinary concrete (from granite crushed stone and quartz sand) are given to compare. Findings. The results of the tests showed the possibility of obtaining concretes of class C 20 / 25 …C 25 / 30 on the basis <b>of</b> slag and <b>ash</b> <b>of</b> TPP at a limited consumption of cement. It is shown that the concrete with traditional aggregates has a lower strength than the concrete, which has ash as fine aggregate. This research results contribute to the increased use <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> in construction that solves the problem of aggregates as well as thermal power plants waste recycling. Originality. New method and technology of application <b>of</b> TPP <b>ashes</b> in concrete are developed. Ash concrete mix has rational flowability, which produces the greatest strength <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> vacuum concrete. This strength is twice or more as large as the strength <b>of</b> vibrated <b>ash</b> concrete mix with flowability S 1. Practical value. The physico-chemical properties <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash</b> as aggregate for concrete are presented. Significant difference <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> from ordinary aggregates is shown. Chemical activity <b>of</b> the <b>ash</b> is justified. The special conditions of cement hardening in the case <b>of</b> using <b>ash</b> as aggregate for concrete are presented. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> over traditional aggregate are shown. The research results contribute to the mass application <b>of</b> TPP <b>ash</b> in construction and obtaining the products from the proposed concrete of low cost with high physical-mechanical properties. Ash as an aggregate has a particularly high efficiency in vibrovacuumized concrete...|$|R
