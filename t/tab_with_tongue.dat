40|$|Abstract. A coaxial {{gas mixer}} is {{designed}} for mixing air and synthesis gas or syngas as fuel. Three-dimensional computational models are harnessed to analyze and predict {{the influence of the}} mechanical tabs aspect ratio and number on the mixing characteristics and performance of the gas mixer. Attention is concentrated on the influence of mechanical tabs on the air-fuel ratio, pressure loss and mixing quality. The optimum design of the mechanical <b>tab</b> was realized <b>with</b> aspect ratio of 0. 32 and 4 <b>tabs</b> <b>with</b> 45 o <b>tab</b> angle. The coaxial gas mixer using the optimized mechanical <b>tabs</b> was realized <b>with</b> λ of 1. 13 corresponding to pressure loss of 37. 2 Pa at 100 m 3 /h air-flow rates and the coefficient of variation (CoV) of mixing was 0. 29. The gas mixer <b>with</b> the mechanical <b>tabs</b> had much better mixing performance than the gas mixer without mechanical <b>tabs</b> <b>with</b> only relatively small increase in pressure loss...|$|R
