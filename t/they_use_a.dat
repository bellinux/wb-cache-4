5|$|Seismic {{activity}} in Indonesia is {{monitored by the}} Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Indonesia. The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> seismograph to measure seismic and tectonic activity. Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. Lapping {{at a rate}} of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue {{to the surface of the}} water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E

5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on the {{underside}} of their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E
2500|$|The Bulls {{also participated}} in the NBA's [...] "Noche Latina" [...] {{celebrations}} throughout March, beginning in 2009. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> slightly altered version of their regular red road uniforms, with the wording [...] "Los Bulls" [...] to honor Hispanics throughout Chicago. The uniforms were used every season except for 2014, when <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> sleeved black version with [...] "Los Bulls" [...] in white with red and black trim.|$|R

5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} and <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> snowmobile {{to reach}} the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach {{what appears to be}} their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in {{that they}} have a high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds. However, microbats use a polarity-based compass, meaning that they differentiate north from south, as opposed to birds which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate latitudes, which may be used in long-distance travel. Since microbats generally have poor eyesight, it is thought <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> magnetite-based method for orientation.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{military}} government banned cockfighting and bullfighting from the island. They did, however introduce a [...] "new" [...] sport called basketball. Basketball {{was used by}} the American soldiers as part of their physical training. When the soldiers played basketball, <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> plain straw basket which was cut open at both ends {{and placed it on the}} highest end of a pole. For <b>a</b> ball, <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> football and the game was played without any established set of rules.|$|R
5|$|The Wu secured Xiangyang, the Nan Territory, Jiangling, and Jing Province from Wei before Shu's Zhuge Liang could, {{and also}} {{defeated}} Meng Huo {{for a second}} (or third) time in the south. Their final battle against Shu is at Yiling, where <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> fire attack to force Liu Bei to retreat to Bai Di Castle, where he is then defeated (or killed). If Wei has fallen first, Wu will defeat the Shu at Chengdu and occupy the lands of Shu Han, killing their officers.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron to steel, but <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth {{that he is}} destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E

5|$|All of M-21, {{except for}} some {{segments}} just outside Grand Rapids and Flint, along with the highway split into two one-way streets inside Flint, is undivided surface road; none of M-21 is freeway. The section between I-75/US23 and Saginaw Street in Flint {{is part of the}} National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-21, like all state highways, is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along its highways. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. Traffic volumes in 2009 vary from 22,756vehicles in the Forest Hills neighborhood east of Grand Rapids to 1,719vehicles in Pewamo daily. MDOT reported that the peak AADT was 36,053vehicles daily near the I-75 interchange in the Flint area.|$|E
5|$|As days pass by, Diganth {{develops}} feeling towards Radha, who reciprocates, and Pavani towards Kitty, {{who falls}} in love with her as well. Kodandaram and Padma approve of their relationship and decide to fix their wedding. Ganesh, in love with Sowmya, first tries confessing his feelings for her in writing, on a kite which on flying accidentally unstrings and flies away. Dejected, and eager to marry her, he speaks to her, and despite having developed a liking for him, she refuses. She decides to take up an offer for a job with an NGO in Switzerland and leaves for the nearest airport, when Ganesh accompanies her. Wishing to fly kites with the village kids across the river one last time, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> coracle to cross it. Just as Sowmya confesses her feelings for him, the coracle capsizes as they encounter a rapid. Ganesh saves her from drowning, when she professes her love for him.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|M-65 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using the roads under its jurisdiction. <b>They</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In 2009, MDOT's surveys calculated that the highest volume of traffic along M-65 was 6,699cars north of the M-55 junction; the highest commercial AADT was 310trucks along the River Road National Scenic Byway segment north to the F-30 junction in Glennie. The lowest traffic counts were the 947cars and 107trucks near the northern terminus in Presque Isle County. The section of M-65 concurrent with M-32 has been listed {{as a part of}} the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia {{has been}} {{discarded}} {{as it is}} a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.|$|E
