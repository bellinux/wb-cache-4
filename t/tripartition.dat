40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} three problems {{about the}} illumination of planar regions with floodlights of prescribed angles. Problem 1 is the decision problem: given a wedge W of angle φ ≤ π, n points p 1, …, pn {{in the plane}} and n angles α 1, …, αn such that Σi= 1 n αi ≤ θ, decide whether W can be illuminated by floodlights of angles α 1, …, αn placed in some order at the points p 1, …, pn and then rotated appropriately. We show that this problem is the exponential time and a specialized version of it (when φ = θ) is in NP. The second problem arises when the n points are in the complementary wedge of W and θ ≥ φ. Bose et al. have shown that a solution exists and gave an O(n log n) algorithm to place the floodlights. Here we give a matching lower bound. Problem 3 involves the illumination of the whole plane.

40|$|Abstract—Phylogenetic {{networks}} {{model the}} evolutionary history of sets of organisms when {{events such as}} hybrid speciation and horizontal gene transfer occur. In spite of their widely acknowledged importance in evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks have so far been studied mostly for specific data sets. We present a general definition of phylogenetic networks in terms of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) {{and a set of}} conditions. Further, we distinguish between model networks and reconstructible ones and characterize the effect of extinction and taxon sampling on the reconstructibility of the network. Simulation studies are a standard technique for assessing the performance of phylogenetic methods. A main step in such studies entails quantifying the topological error between the model and inferred phylogenies. While many measures of tree topological accuracy have been proposed, none exist for phylogenetic networks. Previously, we proposed the first such measure, which applied only to a restricted class of networks. In this paper, we extend that measure to apply to all networks, and prove that it is a metric on the space of phylogenetic networks. Our results allow for the systematic study of existing network methods, and for the design of new accurate ones.

40|$|The Parmenides shows Plato's {{concern to}} relate the various {{branches}} of reality which he had earlier discerned; modifying the ontology of Republic VI, he sought to combine four worlds into one in the third of five positive hypotheses. The Sophist then attempts to show that reality is five; the five components are echoed in the "Psychogony" of the Timaeus, in which work Plato is confronted with a choice between one world and five. Two cryptic classifications from the Philebus suggest Plato’s continued interest in the number, and the Epinomis and Seventh Letter show that the Academy knew of this. Speusippus, depending heavily on the Parmenides, adopted a system of five separate "existences", each with their own first-principles. Xenocrates, though favouring <b>tripartitions,</b> preserved a framework in which the five-fold concept of the whole became understandable. Academic scepticism made it necessary for Posidonlus and Antiochus to look back to the works of Xenocrates for guidance, from whom they received an Old-Academic understanding of the Master and new interest in Speusippus.

40|$|Molecular biology has {{provided}} a rich dataset to develop hypotheses of nervous system evolution. The startling patterning similarities between distantly related animals during {{the development of their}} central nervous system (CNS) have resulted in the hypothesis that a CNS with a single centralized medullary cord and a partitioned brain is homologous across bilaterians. However, the ability to precisely reconstruct ancestral neural architectures from molecular genetic information requires that these gene networks specifically map with particular neural anatomies. A growing body of literature representing the development of a wider range of metazoan neural architectures demonstrates that patterning gene network complexity is maintained in animals with more modest levels of neural complexity. Furthermore, a robust phylogenetic framework that provides the basis for testing the congruence of these homology hypotheses has been lacking since the advent of the field of ‘evo-devo’. Recent progress in molecular phylogenetics is refining the necessary framework to test previous homology statements that span large evolutionary distances. In this review, we describe recent advances in animal phylogeny and exemplify for two neural characters—the partitioned brain of arthropods and the ventral centralized nerve cords of annelids—a test for congruence using this framework. The sequential sister taxa at the base of Ecdysozoa and Spiralia comprise small, interstitial groups. This topology is not consistent with the hypothesis of homology of <b>tripartitioned</b> brain of arthropods and vertebrates as well as the ventral arthropod and rope-like ladder nervous system of annelids. There can be exquisite conservation of gene regulatory networks between distantly related groups with contrasting levels of nervous system centralization and complexity. Consequently, the utility of molecular characters to reconstruct ancestral neural organization in deep time is limited...|$|R

The implication is that a system of such machines (just one would suffice) that is allowed to reproduce unchecked will in short order devour entire biospheres, perhaps even entire solar systems or galaxies if these von Neumann machines are equipped with propulsion devices. An interesting corollary to this is that if two systems of von Neumann machines are battling for resources, the winner will not be decided by which group has the most members; the victorious system will be the one that reproduces faster.

The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone. [...] Back to the Stages. It is markedly different from Either/Or by a <b>tripartition.</b> There are three stages, an esthetic, an ethical, a religious, yet not abstract as the immediate mediate, the unity, but concrete in the qualification of existence categories as pleasure-perdition, action-victory, suffering. But despite this <b>tripartition,</b> the book is nevertheless an either/or. That is, the ethical and the religious stages have an essential relation to each other. The inadequacy of Either/Or is simply that the work ended ethically, as has been shown. In Stages that has been made clear, and the religious is maintained in its place. .... A story of suffering; suffering is the religious category. In Stages the esthete is no longer a clever fellow frequenting B's living room — a hopeful man, etc., because he still is only a possibility; no, he is existing existerer. [...] "It is exactly the same as Either/Or." [...] Constantin Constantius and the Young Man placed together in Quidam of the experiment. (Humor advanced.) Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 294, Journals of Søren Kierkegaard, VIB 41:10 [...] Christ’s love for Peter was boundless in this way: in loving Peter he accomplished loving the person one sees. He did not say, “Peter must first change and become another person before I can love him again.” No, he said exactly the opposite, “Peter is Peter, and I love him. My love, if anything will help him to become another person.” Therefore he did not break off the friendship in order perhaps to renew it if Peter would have become another person; no, he preserved the friendship unchanged and in that way helped Peter to become another person. Do you think that Peter would have been won again without Christ’s faithful friendship? But it is so easy to be a friend when this means nothing else than to request something in particular from the friend and, if the friend does not respond to the request, then to let the friendship cease, until it perhaps begins again if he responds to the request. Is this a relationship of friendship? Who is closer to helping an erring one than the person who calls himself his friend, even if the offense is committed against the friend! But the friend withdraws and says (indeed, it is as if a third person were speaking): When he has become another person, then perhaps he can become my friend again. We are not far from regarding such behavior as magnanimous. But truly we are far from being able to say of such a friend that in loving he loves the person he sees. Christ’s love was boundless, as it must be if this is to be fulfilled: in loving to love the person one sees. This is very easy to perceive. However much and in whatever way a person is changed, he still is not changed {{in such a way that}} he becomes invisible. If this-the impossible-is not the case, then of course we do see him, and the duty is to love the person one sees. Ordinarily we think that if a person has essentially changed for the worse, he is then so changed that we are exempt from loving him. But Christianity asks: Can you because of this change no longer see him? The answer to that must be: Certainly I can see him; I see that he is no longer worth loving. But if you see this, then you do not really see him (which you certainly cannot deny you are doing in another sense), you see only the unworthiness and the imperfection and thereby admit that when you loved him you did not see him in another sense but merely saw his excellence and perfections, which you loved. *Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847) Hong 1995 p. 172-173When a person to whom the possible pertains relates himself equally to the duality of the possible, we say: He expects. To expect contains within itself the same duality that the possible has, and to expect is to relate oneself to the possible purely and simply as such. Then the relationship divides according to the way the expecting person chooses. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which for that very reason cannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope. To relate oneself expectancy to the possibility of evil is to fear. But both the one who hopes and the one who fears are expecting. As soon, however, as the choice is made, the possible is changed, because the possibility of the good is the eternal. It is only in the moment of contact that the duality of the possible is equal; therefore, by the decision to choose hope, one decided infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.People think that they are speaking with ample experience in dividing a person’s life into certain periods and ages and then call the first period the age of hope or of possibility. What nonsense! Thus, in talk about hope they completely leave out the eternal and yet speak about hope. But how is this possible, since hope pertains to the possibility of the good, and thereby to the eternal! On the other hand, how is it possible to speak about hope in such a way that it is assigned to a certain age! Surely the eternal extends over the whole of life and there is and should be hope to the end; then there is no period that is the age of hope, but a person’s whole life should be the time of hope! And then they think they are speaking with ample experience about hope-by abolishing the eternal. *Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847) Hong 1995 p. 249-251 ...|$|E

Calculations showed that in the first stage of this fission reaction, the isotopes ^ 82 Ge and ^ 154 Nd are formed with relatively large probabilities and in the second stage of sequential fission of the isotope Nd mainly Ni and Ge are formed. This is in agreement with the yield of the isotope ^ 68 Ni which is observed as the product of the collinear cluster <b>tripartition</b> in the experiment. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

This new result on dissecting point sets is used to prove that lights of specified angles not exceeding can be placed at n fixed {{points in the}} plane to illuminate the entire plane {{if and only if}} the angles sum to at least 2. We give O(n log n) algorithms for both these problems...|$|E

For the <b>tripartition</b> problem on a triconnected graph, a naive algorithm can be designed based on a directional embedding of G in the two-dimensional Euclidean space. However, for graphs of large number of vertices, the implementing of this algorithm requires high precision real arithmetic to distinguish two close vertices in the plane. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dealing with the <b>tripartition</b> problem by introducing a new data structure called the region graph, which represents a kind of combinatorial embedding of the given graph in the plane. The algorithm constructs a desired <b>tripartition</b> combinatorially {{in the sense that it}} does not require any geometrical computation with actual coordinates in the Euclidean space...|$|E
40|$|The {{entanglement}} between noncomplementary {{blocks of}} a many-body system, where {{a part of}} the system forms an ignored environment, is a largely untouched problem without analytic results. We rectify this gap by studying the logarithmic negativity between two macroscopic sets of spins in an arbitrary <b>tripartition</b> of a collection of mutually interacting spins described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian. This entanglement measure is found to be finite and universal at the critical point for any <b>tripartition</b> whereas it diverges for a bipartition. In this limiting case, we show that it behaves as the entanglement entropy, suggesting a deep relation between the scaling exponents of these two independently defined quantities which may be valid for other systems.
