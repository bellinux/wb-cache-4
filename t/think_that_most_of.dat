40|$|Introduction In this book, {{the philosopher}} John Searle {{presents}} a wide-ranging and pugnacious critique {{of much of}} mainstream cognitive science. In particular, he argues that consciousness is the "central mental phenomenon" [p. xi], and therefore the proper object of cognitive science research, yet {{he believes that the}} field has either ignored consciousness or has failed to address it adequately. Searle <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the dominant philosophical views about the mind and about consciousness are inconsistent with scientific fact or everyday experience. Searle is familiar to members of the artificial intelligence community as one <b>of</b> the field's <b>most</b> vocal critics, starting, at least, with (Searle, 1980), and his "Chinese Room" argument against the possibility of "strong AI. " While he certainly still believes that a mind {{is more than just a}} suitably programmed digital computer, he is committed to the view that mental phenomena [...] - specifically including consciou...|$|R

Fortunately there is no lack of authentic material from which to glean the incidents of the struggle. Polybius visited all the passes of the Alps some forty years after the event, and conversed with tribesmen who had witnessed the passage of Hannibal, and {{there can be no doubt}} that his descriptions are far more accurate than those of Livy, who wrote somewhat later and had no personal knowledge of the affair. Numbers of books have been written as to the identity of the passes traversed by Hannibal. The whole of these have been discussed and summarized by Mr. W. J. Law, and as it appears to me that his arguments are quite conclusive I have adopted the line which he lays down as that followed by Hannibal.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{was he a}} {{fighting}} dog; but once attacked, he lacked a sense of values, being unable to distinguish between dogs that he could beat and dogs {{with whom he had}} [...] "no earthly." [...] It was, in fact, as well to interfere at once, especially in the matter of retrievers, for he never forgot having in his youth been attacked by a retriever from behind. No, he never forgot, and never forgave, an enemy. Only a month before that day of which I cannot speak, being very old and ill, he engaged an Irish terrier on whose impudence he had long had his eye, and routed him. And how a battle cheered his spirit! He was certainly no Christian; but, allowing for essential dog, he was very much a gentleman. And I do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us who live on this earth these days would rather leave it with that label on us than the other. For to be a Christian, as Tolstoy understood the word--and no one else in our time has had logic and love of truth enough to give it coherent meaning--is (to be quite sincere) not suited to men of Western blood. Whereas--to be a gentleman! It is a far cry, but perhaps it can be done. In him, at all events, there was no pettiness, no meanness, and no cruelty, and though he fell below his ideal at times, this never altered the true look of his eyes, nor the simple loyalty in his soul.|$|E
6000|$|Now if we {{dip into}} this {{miscellany}} {{of things that}} figure and have figured in schools, if we turn them over and look at them, and seek to generalize about them, we shall begin {{to see that the}} most persistently present, and the living reality of it all, is this: to expand, to add to and organize and supplement that apparatus of understanding and expression the savage possesses in colloquial speech. The pressing business of the school is to widen the range of intercourse. [Footnote: This way of putting it may jar a little upon the more or less explicit preconceptions of many readers, who are in reality in harmony with the tone of thought of this paper. They will have decided that the school work is to [...] "train the mind," [...] to [...] "teach the pupil to think," [...] or upon some similar phrase. But I venture to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these phrases are at once too wide and too narrow. They are too wide because they ignore the spontaneous activity of the child and the extra-scholastic forces of mind-training, and they are too narrow because they ignore {{the fact that we do}} not progress far with our thoughts unless we throw them out into objective existence by means of words, diagrams, models, trial essays. Even if we do not talk to others we must, silently or vocally or visibly, talk to ourselves at least to get on. To acquire the means of intercourse is to learn to think, so far as learning goes in the matter.] It is only secondarily--so far as schooling goes--or, at any rate, subsequently, that the idea of shaping, or, at least, helping to shape, the expanded natural man into a citizen, comes in. It is only as a subordinate necessity that the school is a vehicle for the inculcation of facts. The facts come into the school not for their own sake, but in relation to intercourse. It is only upon a common foundation of general knowledge that the initiated citizens of an educated community will be able to communicate freely together. With the net of this phrase, [...] "widening the range of intercourse," [...] I think it is possible to gather together all that is essential in the deliberate purpose of schooling. Nothing that remains outside is of sufficient magnitude to be of any importance in the small-scale sketch of human development we are now making:-- ...|$|E

This idea is all the more true for buildings being constructed based on passive designs.

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} <b>of</b> science <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> laws <b>of</b> nature (even {{those of}} fundamental physics) are so called ceteris paribus laws, i. e., roughly speaking, laws with exceptions. Yet, the ceteris paribus clause {{of these laws}} is problematic. Amongst the more infamous difficulties is the danger that 'For all x: Fx ⊃ Gx, ceteris paribus' may state {{no more than a}} tautology: 'For all x: Fx ⊃ Gx, unless not'. One of the major attempts to avoid this problem (and others concerning ceteris paribus laws) is to claim that the subject matter of laws are ascriptions of dispositions, powers, capacities etc., and not the regular behaviour we find in nature. That we do not know whether the cetera are paria in a specific situation does not matter to the dispositionalist because the objects have the disposition regardless of the circumstances. The defence of the latter claim is that dispositions can be instantiated without being manifested. Hence, the laws that ascribe dispositions are strict and it looks as if they do not face the above mentioned problems of ceteris paribus laws. In this essay I attempt to show that these assumptions are wrong. I hope to illustrate that not only does the ceteris paribus clause reoccur inside the dispositions, moreover, there are laws—laws about non-fundamental entities with instable dispositions—which bear a ceteris paribus clause that cannot be hidden in a disposition...|$|R
30|$|That’s {{the fantasy}} of some {{evolutionary}} theories. There are problems with it, of course. First of all, what is intelligent behavior? Most people, I think, mean by intelligent behavior, behavior that satisfies your preferences, or something like that. That gets a little difficult if your preferences are changing and are in conflict and so on. If you observe, {{as we did in}} that book (March et al. 2000), that rules solve problems, then {{in the sense that the}} problems faced get smaller, then, yes, rules reduce the problems’ face and that’s consistent with the proposition that over time, rules have fewer and fewer changes because they’re eating into the problems’ face, they’re no longer problems. In that sense, they’re more intelligent. The notion that magically, through learning, we will end up with an optimum set of rules, I think is fanciful. The process has all the traps of standard evolutionary theory. There aren’t typically equilibria, and if there are equilibria, there are multiple equilibria. In some sense, I <b>think</b> it’s likely <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the time, as rules change, they in some sense, make things better.
