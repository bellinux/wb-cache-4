5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
25|$|As Vietnam has to {{cope with}} many changes due to its fast development, the water sector {{in general and the}} {{irrigation}} sector in particular face great challenges. The current status leaves great potential to improve the system towards a sustainable irrigation management. Nevertheless, the participation in international conferences and the trend of the government to decentralize the system and implement a participatory based irrigation management strategy suggest that <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> willing to develop its policies further in order to gain long-term food security and save its natural resources at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{drivers who}} are {{required}} {{to compete in the}} FIA Formula One World Championship under the nationality of their passport, the FIA's International Sporting Code states that teams competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship shall compete under the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their FIA racing licence. On the basis of this regulation, despite the fact that most current teams are based in the UK, <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> officially represented in Formula One only by teams holding a racing licence issued by the British National Sporting Authority. Teams take the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their licence for the period of validity of that licence and the change of the nationality is allowed. Several teams changed their nationality during their competition in Formula One (e.g. Shadow in 1976 from American to British, Benetton in 1996 from British to Italian, Renault in 2011 from French to British). Benetton is the only team to have achieved victories while racing under two different nationalities.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} difference between the European and U.S. banking systems was the absence of a central bank in the United States. European states were able to extend the supply of money during periods of low cash reserves. The belief that the U.S. economy was vulnerable without a central bank was not new. Early in 1907, banker Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. warned {{in a speech to the}} New York Chamber of Commerce that [...] "unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history".|$|E

500|$|Most of Hayes's {{foreign policy}} {{concerns}} involved Latin America. In 1878, following the Paraguayan War, he arbitrated a territorial dispute between Argentina and Paraguay. Hayes awarded the disputed {{land in the}} Gran Chaco region to Paraguay, and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city (Villa Hayes) and a department (Presidente Hayes) in his honor. Hayes was also perturbed over the plans of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which was then owned by Colombia. Concerned about a repetition of French adventurism in Mexico, Hayes interpreted the Monroe Doctrine firmly. In a message to Congress, Hayes explained his opinion on the canal: [...] "The policy of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> a canal under American control... The United States cannot consent to the surrender of this control to any European power or any combination of European powers." ...|$|E
