5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E

5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E

In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E

40|$|Current CGSB testing {{standards}} (CAN/CGSB: 65. 17 - 1999) require that participants be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in calm water tests only. The effect that two separate wave frequencies {{had on the}} ability of people <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position was investigated. Twenty-three participants were instructed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in the following conditions: calm water, a regular wave spectrum, and an irregular wave spectrum. There {{were no significant differences in}} the length of time it took <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position across all three conditions. Visual observations of the participants in the water suggest that more physical effort was required on their part to stabilize themselves while in waves. Two participants were unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vertical position in calm water. In conclusion, the two wave spectrums tested increased the amount of physical effort required by the participants to remain in a vertical position, but did not significantly affect the time it took to do so.

5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, {{along with the}} type of cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|The initial mission <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> {{metallic}} disc {{from one}} side of an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it {{from one side}} of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous planetary systems, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that {{are found in the}} missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> reticle over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope warns of near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E

5|$|While a {{contestant}} {{is in the}} vault, contestants who {{are waiting}} in the line play various mini-games. The games played include passing ten people in the line through a hula-hoop; if successful, those ten move straight {{to the beginning of}} the line. Other challenges include two teams of five working as a group <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> beach ball across a track and offering random contestants the opportunity to open a red envelope that can send them to the beginning or end of the line.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show with some success. On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to unmask and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as a surprise that he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a sign that the promotion has plans <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match but the fact that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E

5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> <b>a</b> large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around Battle of Austerlitz, in which the forces {{under the command of}} Napoleon must defend the Austrian village of Austerlitz from the invading Austro-Russian army, led by Tsar Alexander. In the game, the battle itself begins at 7am on 2 December 1805 and is played out in a series of turns. A turn lasts fifteen minutes and a total number of eight orders must be issued {{before the end of the}} turn. The player may choose either French or Russian forces to control throughout the game. In order <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> unit, the player must select them and point their the cursor over the desired location; however, movement is restricted within a turn. At the start of a movement phase, the player can issue a command to one of their units. Orders include move, attack, defend, shell, stay in reserve, retreat and report.|$|E

5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds it is easier <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors {{on the basis of}} style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>a</b> cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
