Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E

The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner.

5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry.

Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E

All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass.

Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot over {{eighteen}} days in April 2005.

Many of Glatzer and Westmoreland's Echo Park neighbors also stood in as extras. Due to California's child labor laws, they could only film with the underage cast members for six hours a day, so cinematographer Eric Steelberg used a hand-held camera with few accessories <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>the</b> time they could spend filming. Steelberg filmed the project in high-definition video format, which was converted to film during post-production.
