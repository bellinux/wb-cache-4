25|$|During {{her third}} {{season with the}} Cardinal, Press set new program records for assists (16) and shots (143). Seven of her 21 goals during the 2009 season were game-winning goals. Her 58 points raised the bar that she set during the {{previous}} season for the second-highest point total in a single season and ranked third in the nation. Press broke her previous record for fastest goal scored in Stanford history after scoring 23 seconds into a match against Brigham Young University. She scored a golden goal and made an assist against the UCLA Bruins during the Cardinal's 2–1 win securing the Cardinal into its first-ever NCAA Division I Tournament final. During the NCAA College Cup final loss against the North Carolina Tar Heels, an apparent tying goal by Press in the 89th minute was ruled offside.

She was named to the All-Pac-10 first team and was a semifinalist for the Hermann Trophy.|$|E

2500|$|.....I {{had a lot}} of {{time for}} Norling as an {{international}} referee. The Welshman and New Zealander David Bishop would be the best I've seen during my years of Test match rugby. And the common factor linking Norling and Bishop was that both played the advantage rule very well, they had a real empathy for the game and its players, and they seemed to enjoy letting the game flow. Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling was also one of the more flamboyant referees. The crowd always knew when he was out there. At the same time, he was a <b>top</b> <b>drawer</b> referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E

40|$|We studied {{decorative}} Portuguese {{furniture from}} the 18 th century Clérigos Church in Porto, {{to identify the}} woods used, to analyze their possible origin and understand the criteria for wood choice, according to sample location. We identified wood from Acacia sp., Castanea sativa, Couratari sp. and Dalbergia nigra. D. nigra, Acacia sp. and Couratari sp. may have arrived from Brazil, according to their natural distribution and the Portuguese colonial routes; C. sativa was abundant in the North Region of Portugal. In the 18 th century, golden metal brass over black furniture was in fashion in Portuguese ecclesiastical cabinet making. Due to its dark colour, Dalbergia nigra was a desirable wood for the exposed structures of ecclesiastical furniture, such as <b>top</b> <b>drawers</b> and <b>top</b> tables. Couratari is a pale wood. Therefore, it {{was used in the}} inner structure of the drawers and legs. Acacia wood was also used in internal parts due to its durability. C. sativa was local and extensive; its wood was used in the inner structures, where it could not be seen. Marks were found in the Couratari wood, which indicated that the timber from chest boards employed to carry sugar from Brazil to Portugal was reused. The high silica content of Couratari wood makes it ideal for building “sugar chests”. POCI 2010 (Programa Operacional Ciência e Inovação 2010).

60|$|Worrying, indeed, {{seemed to}} be the twentieth-century specialty. Lord Emsworth never worried. Nature had {{equipped}} him with a mind so admirably constructed for withstanding the disagreeableness of life that if an unpleasant thought entered it, it passed out again a moment later. Except for a few of life's fundamental facts, such as that his check book was in the right-hand <b>top</b> <b>drawer</b> of his desk; that the Honorable Freddie Threepwood was a young idiot who required perpetual restraint; and that when in doubt about anything he had merely to apply to his secretary, Rupert Baxter--except for these basic things, he never remembered anything {{for more than a few}} minutes.|$|E
