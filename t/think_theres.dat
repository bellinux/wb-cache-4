5000|$|The best {{episodes of}} Parks And Recreation balance giving due {{time to the}} shows premise and {{shedding}} light {{on the relationship between}} the characters; thats the reason that its not a genre-defying game-changer, but just a solid, reliable, and especially effective situation comedy. Leonard PierceThe A.V. Club Alan Sepinwall, television columnist for The Star-Ledger, said the meetings themselves were very entertaining and allowed for good character development between April and Andy, and Ron and April. However, he said the main plot with Leslie and the historic mansion was not tied strongly enough to Leslies fear that Mark and Ann would get married. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode, especially the callbacks to previous episodes and the interaction of the characters during the meetings. Although the show was only on hiatus for about a month, he said, [...] "Man, it feels so good to have Parks and Recreation back. ...

Yearwood noted that finding a comfort zone when recording {{was more important than}} simply finding confidence."I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a comfort level. I used to worry so much about it being pitch-perfect and over-thinking things. As a demo singer, you would go into a studio and youd have a limited amount of time to sing your songs.

There was this {{prevailing}} sense of, Were not quite sure whats happening or what is cool, but we know that its somewhere around here, in this room. It was this vague confusion, with everybody kind of sniffing for blood. It wasnt that it was a bad party, or that I dont like The Strokes; I just <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a lot of confusion right now in the music business. Then, later on, I realized the song was really personal. I didnt know where I was, and I didnt know I was actually lost. It wasnt about the party at all; its about searching but not knowing what youre searching for. Theres the train motif, being on this train heading for either oblivion or salvation - and just holding on for dear life. That song came down from some mountain somewhere, because it was right after I wrote it that I sort of packed it in.|$|E

I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating peoples rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform."

5000|$|A {{recurring}} theme {{that has occurred}} several times in Jason and Sams romance is the appearance of stars. The theme of the stars first appeared on November 19, 2004 after Sams daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam were grieving for her and started talking about heaven. Jason {{said that when he}} is near the ocean, he feels like he is a part of something [...] "bigger than himself." [...] Sam replied that for her it was the stars. [...] Sam: For me its the stars.

Jason and Sam first discuss the stars [...] Sam later went outside to gaze at the stars and feel closer to her baby. However she wasnt completely healed and passed out on the roof. She was found by Alexis, who took her back inside. Stars next appeared on April 20, 2005. Sam and Jason were in Italy looking for Michael and stopped to gaze at a shooting star. Jason promised Sam that he would bring her back to Italy to spend time together. The star gazing later inspired Jason to buy Sam a star shaped necklace, which became a tangible item of the theme of stars in their relationship. Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E
5000|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesnt {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I <b>think</b> <b>theres</b> a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded Houses leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwans novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
