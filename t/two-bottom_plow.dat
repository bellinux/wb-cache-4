25|$|The WC {{was popular}} in the Great Depression for its good value, {{affordable}} price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from off-the-shelf components, and that its steel channel iron frame eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a <b>two-bottom</b> <b>plow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{invested}} $12 {{million in}} tooling to finance Ferguson's new distribution company. The investment {{resulted in the}} production of the 9N tractor which was introduced on June 29, 1939. It was officially called a [...] "Ford tractor with the Ferguson system", although the name Ford-Ferguson was widely used. It sold for $585 including rubber tires, power take-off, Ferguson hydraulics, an electric starter, generator, and battery; lights were optional. Ford's 9N further improved the cantankerous Model F by updating the ignition with a distributor and coil. An innovative system of tire mounts for the rear wheels and versatile axle mounts for the fronts enabled farmers to accommodate any width row-crop work they needed. The 9N weighed 2340 pounds and had 13 drawbar horsepower, which could pull a <b>two-bottom</b> <b>plow.</b> It was designed to be safe, quiet and easy to operate. Ford once said [...] "Our competition is the horse."; the 9N was intended for farmers who were not mechanically minded.|$|E
