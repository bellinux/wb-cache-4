5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of <b>the</b> <b>basil</b> varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the {{original}} Sanskrit, {{the name is}} written as Tulasīdāsa. Using the Hunterian transliteration system, it is written as Tulsidas or Tulsīdās reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are {{an aspect of the}} Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages and can vary between regions. The name is a compound of two Sanskrit words: Tulasī, which is an Indian variety of <b>the</b> <b>basil</b> plant considered auspicious by Vaishnavas (devotees of god Vishnu and his avatars like Rama), and Dāsa, which means slave or servant and by extension, devotee. Tulsidas, which means a servant of the plant Tulsi.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Basil</b> D'Oliveira affair {{changed all}} that. D'Oliveira was a mixed-race South African (partly black - [...] "coloured" [...] under the Apartheid classification). Unable {{to play for}} his {{national}} side, he came to England and played for them instead, going on tour to the West Indies in 1967. [...] His performance on that tour was not impressive, and he was omitted from the Ashes Test squads in the following summer until the fifth and final Test at the Oval. He scored 158, and was expected {{to make it to}} the team to tour South Africa in winter. When initially he was not selected, there was great controversy in England, with the English Test selectors being accused of pandering to the racist regime in South Africa. Then, when a vacancy became available through another player dropping out, D'Oliveira was selected in his place. But South African Prime Minister John Vorster opposed his selection, saying that it was not a team of the Marylebone Cricket Club, but of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. England did not tour.|$|E

2500|$|Smith captained England in 25 of his 50 Test match appearances, but in {{a period}} rich in batting talent he was rarely {{guaranteed}} a place. His uncertainty against fast bowling was exposed {{by a series of}} low scores in the mid 1960s, and Smith faced considerable press criticism, unusual for the time. Still, he was a good tourist and was made captain of the England tour of India in 1963–64 when Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey were unavailable and without England's top bowlers Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. He lost the toss five times in a row and had so many injuries and illnesses that in the Second Test at Madras Smith had to use three batsmen, two wicket-keepers and six bowlers. When Mickey Stewart was unable to play after the first day because of dysentery he seriously considered calling up the cricket journalist Henry Blofeld, but managed to survive with just 10 men. Smith became the first England captain to draw all five Tests in a series (it was the third time India had done this) and was considered to have done well to avoid defeat. It was his best series with 306 runs (51.00) and when Ted Dexter retired after losing 1–0 to Bobby Simpson's Australia in 1964 Smith was made captain for England's last tour of South Africa before <b>the</b> <b>Basil</b> d'Oliveira Crisis. He won 1–0 against the talented Springboks, the last captain to defeat them in a Test series until 1996–97. It was also a personal success as he took four catches in the vital First Test and 10 in the series. He also made his third and last Test century, a top-score of 121 in England's 442 as they replied to South Africa's 501/7 in the Third Test, and finished with 257 runs (42.83).
