500|$|Most of {{the first}} [...] "day attack" [...] AV-8B Harrier IIs were {{upgraded}} to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of Direct Voice Input (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack avionics system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes AN/ASB-19 angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate <b>targeting</b> <b>capability.</b> Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 chaff-flare dispensers, an AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver, and an AN/ALQ-126C jammer pod.|$|E

The Joint STARS aircraft served as the network command-and-control node, as well as a node for transmitting in-flight target message updates to an AGM-154 C-1 Joint Standoff Weapon carried by U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornets using its advanced long range tracking and <b>targeting</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Warsaw Pact nations arguably {{enjoyed in}} Central Europe a massive {{conventional}} superiority over NATO.

The RSD-10 {{had the capacity to}} destroy all NATO bases and installations with negligible warning.

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Homeland Security Affairs (May 2009), v. 5 no. 2 The 2007 National Preparedness Guidelines introduces {{the concept of}} a National Preparedness System in which national capabilities are coordinated to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from all hazards in a way that balances risk with resources and need. To understand the resource implications of the National Preparedness System, it is critically important to determine the costs associated with achieving and sustaining <b>target</b> levels of <b>capability.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} threefold.

50|$|Radiation Oncologists {{have been}} using proton therapy to treat cancer since the 1950s. Long {{recognized}} for their <b>targeting</b> <b>capability,</b> proton beams achieve greater precision than traditional X-rays, while exposing healthy tissue to less radiation. This allows physicians to deliver high doses of radiation even when tumors are close to sensitive organs and tissue. A proton therapy beam’s powerful energy is focused directly on a patient’s tumor. Once released, the energy stops - there is no exit dose and no additional radiation unlike X-ray beams and gamma knife rays.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} low toxicity, high loading capacity, {{and ease of}} fabrication, polycationic nanocarriers {{demonstrate}} great promise compared to their rivals such as viral vectors which show high immunogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, and lipid-based vectors which cause dose dependence toxicity. Polyethyleneimine and chitosan are among the polymeric carriers that have been extensively studies for development of gene delivery therapeutics. Other polycationic carriers such as poly(beta-amino esters) and polyphosphoramidate are being added to the library of potential gene carriers. In addition to the variety of polymers and copolymers, the ease of controlling the size, shape, surface chemistry of these polymeric nano-carriers gives them an edge in <b>targeting</b> <b>capability</b> and taking advantage of enhanced permeability and retention effect.|$|E
50|$|Conflict Short of Warfare: As US {{precision}} <b>targeting</b> <b>capability</b> improves, adaptive adversaries {{will seek}} to avoid direct, unambiguous action that will provoke a violent US response. Instead, they {{will seek to}} remain in the grey shadowland between peace and war, avoiding US strengths, while attacking US weaknesses in subtle ways. Understanding this, future adversaries will “fight stupid or fight asymmetrically” and the Army should prepare for the latter. Subtle nuances of both international and US law will affect leader’s decision-making processes as the traditional definition of an enemy combatant becomes increasingly obsolete. As adversaries avoid becoming easily identifiable targets, Soldiers will increasingly have to decide not just how but if the employment of violence will best serve national interests.|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} discussion addresses how we measured the independent variables, that is, {{the extent of}} uncertainty and controversy for each case. This {{is a form of}} within-case analysis (Eisenhardt 1989). We triangulated the analysis with multiple interviewees and archival documents. We determined the extent of uncertainty based on how reliably the acquiring firm believed it could assess the nature of the <b>target’s</b> <b>capabilities</b> as well as the opportunities in the market for which the capabilities would be used (i.e., {{the extent to which the}} firm could or could not assign a probability distribution to the value of the deal). In turn, we determined the extent of controversy based on what the respondents told us about the degree of consensus within the buyer about the value of the potential <b>target’s</b> <b>capabilities</b> and about how the buyer might use them if it were to complete the deal.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} capabilities-based theory of {{acquirer}} target selection, arguing that acquirers will pursue both low <b>capability</b> <b>targets</b> in existing contexts to deploy existing capabilities, and high <b>capability</b> <b>targets</b> in new contexts to acquire new capabilities. These arguments are formalized in an analytical model that jointly considers {{the benefits and}} costs of acquisition {{as a function of}} <b>target</b> <b>capability</b> level and context. The predictions from this model are tested in the Chinese Brewing industry (1998 - 2007), with results showing that acquirers strongly prefer inferior targets in existing geographic markets, but are relatively more likely to choose superior targets in new markets, especially if they have strong acquisition capabilities. Our study provides insight into the factors driving target selection, and contributes to a capabilities-based understanding of acquisitions...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{synthesized}} NIR emitting long-persistence luminescent ZGG nanoparticles {{by employing}} a sol–gel method. In order {{to enhance their}} specific capability to breast cancer cells, ZGG nanoparticles were modified with anti-EpCAM antibody to obtain ZGG-EpCAM nanoprobes. These nanoprobes not only possess a narrow-band emission peaked at 698  nm under excitation at 254  nm with excellent NIR long afterglow properties and low cytotoxicity but also possess <b>targeting</b> <b>capability</b> toward breast cancer cells (MCF 7) which overexpressed EpCAM antigen. Further results of in vitro imaging confirm that ZGG-EpCAM possesses specific <b>targeting</b> <b>capability</b> toward breast cancer cells. More important, we could utilize ZGG-EpCAM long afterglow nanoprobes to realize the real-time monitored breast cancer {{with the help of}} IVIS Lumina II imaging system. This will improve the efficiency of detection in vivo at an early stage. We expect this study to provide a new perspective in the diagnosis of cancer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractImmuno-enzymosomes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for the targeting of enzymes to cancer cells to achieve site specific activation of anticancer prodrugs. Previously, we reported that the enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS), capable of activating anthracycline-glucuronide prodrugs, can be coupled {{to the surface of}} inmunoliposomes directed against human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR- 3). This study aimed at the design of an immuno-enzymosome formulation with maximum enzyme <b>targeting</b> <b>capability.</b> By purification of the commercially available enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS), a 2 -fold increase in the enzyme specific activity and a 4 -fold increase in the enzymatic activity of immuno-enzymosomes was achieved. As a result, upon incubation with human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR- 3), cell-associated enzymatic activity increased correspondingly. The optimized immuno-enzymosomes were shown to bind to the target cells in a specific fashion. Above a GUS/Fab′ molar ratio of 0. 5, impairment of the target cell binding ability of the immuno-enzymosomes was observed. This was likely due to a steric hindrance effect mediated by the presence of large amounts of bulky GUS molecules on the liposome surface. Nevertheless, increasing the GUS density {{on the surface of the}} immuno-enzymosomes to levels by far exceeding the GUS/Fab′ molar ratio of 0. 5, yielded a considerably improved enzyme <b>targeting</b> <b>capability...</b>|$|E
