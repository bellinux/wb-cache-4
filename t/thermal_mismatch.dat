50|$|Low-temperature solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (LT-SOFCs), {{operating}} lower than 650 °C, are {{of great interest}} for future research because the high operating temperature is currently what restricts the development and deployment of SOFCs. A low-temperature SOFC is more reliable due to smaller <b>thermal</b> <b>mismatch</b> and easier sealing. Additionally, a lower temperature requires less insulation and therefore has a lower cost. Cost is further lowered due to wider material choices for interconnects and compressive nonglass/ceramic seals. Perhaps most importantly, at a lower temperature, SOFCs can be started more rapidly and with less energy, which lends itself to uses in portable and transportable applications.|$|E
50|$|To combat this, {{researchers}} {{created a}} functionally graded ceria/bismuth-oxide bilayered electrolyte where the GDC layer on the anode side protects the ESB layer from decomposing while the ESB on the cathode side blocks the leakage current through the GDC layer. This leads to near-theoretical open-circuit potential (OPC) with two highly conductive electrolytes, that by themselves {{would not have}} been sufficiently stable for the application. This bilayer proved to be stable for 1400 hours of testing at 500 °C and showed no indication of interfacial phase formation or <b>thermal</b> <b>mismatch.</b> While this makes strides towards lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs, it also opens doors for future research to try and understand this mechanism.|$|E

Based on x-ray techniques we consistently measure a tensile residual stress for CdTe/Si, but observe compressive residual stresses for CdTe/Ge and CdTe/GaAs.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, a good {{combination}} between Si 3 N 4 -based seal coatings and porous Si 3 N 4 substrate {{was achieved}} by room temperature spraying and pressureless sintering.

Further theoretical analysis indicates that the <b>thermal</b> expansion <b>mismatch</b> between the two layers produced a large strengthening effect for the fraction of the porosity below a critical level and that substrates with the high fraction of porosity showed complete cracking, as the cracks initiating in adjacent coatings.
