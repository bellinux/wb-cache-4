Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis).

40|$|Investigative {{analysis}} of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion {{lead to the}} revelation that Newton’s laws of mechanics are incomplete and improperly correlated with his universal law of gravitation. It is subsequently shown that even Galileo’s discovery that all objects fall {{at the same rate}} is only conditionally true. Ironically, it is Newton’s modification of Kepler’s third law of planetary motion that provided the insights leading to these discoveries, including the required modification of Newton’s universal law of gravitation. During the ensuing formalization process, Newton’s laws of mechanics are expanded as required, and correctly incorporated into an expanded version of the universal law of gravitation. The newly interpreted, and properly correlated laws are concurrently and subsequently validated through mathematical analysis and found to be in full agreement with Kepler’s laws, and consistent with Newton’s, and Einstein’s earlier determined fundamental principles of equivalence involving gravitational and inertial forces. <b>The</b> broad <b>extent</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> physical, and astronomical, sciences are affected by this work gives evidence of the fundamental nature of the discoveries presented...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the case of intensive resource extractive projects in the Blueberry River First Nations in Northern British Columbia, Canada, as a case study. Drawing on the parallels between concepts of cumulative environmental and cumulative health impacts, we highlight three axes along which to gauge the effects of intensive extraction projects. These are environmental, health, and social justice axes. Using an intersectional analysis highlights the way in which using individual indicators to measure impact, rather than considering cumulative effects, hides <b>the</b> full <b>extent</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> affected First Nations communities are impacted by intensive extraction projects. We use the case study to contemplate several mechanisms at the intersection of these axes whereby the negative effects of each not only add but also amplify through their interactions. For example, direct impact along the environmental axis indirectly amplifies other health and social justice impacts separately from the direct impacts on those axes. We conclude there is significant work still to be done to use cumulative indicators to study the impacts of extractive industry projects—like liquefied natural gas—on peoples, environments, and health...|$|R
