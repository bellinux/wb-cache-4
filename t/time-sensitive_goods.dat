50|$|Safety {{stock is}} used as a buffer to protect {{organizations}} from stockouts caused by inaccurate planning or poor schedule adherence by suppliers. As such, its cost (in both material and management) is often seen as a drain on financial resources that results in reduction initiatives. In addition, <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods</b> such as food, drink, and other perishable items could spoil and go to waste if held as safety stock for too long. Various methods exist to reduce safety stock: these include better use of technology, increased collaboration with suppliers, and more accurate forecasting. In a lean supply environment, lead times are reduced, which can help minimize safety stock levels, thus reducing the likelihood and impact of stockouts.Due to the cost of safety stock, many organizations opt for a service level-led safety stock calculation; for example, a 95% service level could result in stockouts, but is at a level that is acceptable to the company. The lower the service level, the lower the requirement for safety stock.|$|E

In the case of Newcastle, the goods {{would need to be}} brought from an underground station to street level, to then be distributed to the final destination via another mode of transport.

40|$|As {{the leading}} {{consumer}} goods design, development, sourcing and logistics company, Li & Fung Limited (Li & Fung) supplies high-volume, <b>time-sensitive</b> consumer <b>goods</b> for global retailers and brands. One of Li & Fung's strengths is its diverse operational network; the company sources from over 15, 000 suppliers and operates in over 40 global economies. However, Li Fung is also faced with unique challenges in a constantly evolving business environment. Many of these challenges {{are linked to}} the ever-increasing demands of customers (and end consumers) in a consumer-centric industry that has seen margins fall significantly. A dynamic costing model is developed to better understand profitability at the customer level within Li and Fung. Historically, gross margins have been a sufficient measure of customer profitability. With a variety of factors causing margins to decrease throughout the fashion industry combining with an increase in variation in the level of service required by customers, gross margins are no longer a reliable means of assessing customer profitability. The research examines the current process for managing customer orders within a product group with a principal-based business model via a series of interviews with employees in various functional roles. The cost-modeling proceeded by creating a cost allocation model that allocates product development and operating costs to customers {{on the basis of their}} utilization of resources. The model provides both individualized income statements for each customer as well as an aggregated view of customer profitability for the entire product group. The model is demonstrated with one medium-sized product group using data from calendar year 2014. Recommendations and opportunities for follow-on research and extensions are discussed. by David Semko. Thesis: M. B. A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, 2016.

40|$|Considering {{that every}} {{disaster}} {{is unique and}} doing research during natural disasters is difficult, we show the possibility to learn from solutions of logistics research. One main problem of logistics planning in cases of natural disasters is relief good distribution. While this problem belongs to the class of vehicle routing problems (VRP) under uncertainty, the task of transshipping relief goods needs to be considered more intensively. Especially, assigning trucks to doors to load or discharge has a high impact {{on the performance of}} a transshipment facility. In our approach, known and specially developed scheduling heuristics are applied to logistic operations in disaster relief. Therefore, we transfer the given problem of relief goods handling to transshipment of less-than-truckload (LTL) items. Here, our main objective is to improve efficiency of handling relief goods in terminals under consideration of urgent shipments. Based on limited resources for cargo handling in disaster areas, various weights and sizes of relief <b>goods,</b> <b>time-sensitive</b> shipments like medicaments or food, improper truck arrival times and different departure times, we apply and evaluate several strategies to schedule trucks in the unloading process. We apply and compare strategies to schedule incoming trucks, buffer areas and handling equipment like forklift trucks based on real data. Therefore, we developed fast decision algorithms to react to uncertain and changing information. Additionally, six different scheduling heuristics were developed to solve the complex problem of planning the utilization of unloading gates, one buffer area belonging to each unloading zone and a fleet of forklift trucks. The algorithms allow the implementation into a real-time system...|$|R
40|$|California {{would be}} the seventh largest economy in the world, {{if it were a}} nation. Efficient goods {{movement}} is crucial to California's economy. To support continued growth of the State's economy, Caltrans is leading the development of a Statewide Goods Movement Strategy. This strategy is being prepared as a response to a recommendation of the 1993 California Transportation Plan. It serves as one element, together with the Transportation System Performance Measures report being prepared in parallel by Caltrans, of the 1998 California Transportation Plan update. Air cargo consists predominantly of high-value, <b>time-sensitive</b> or time-definite <b>goods,</b> e. g., electronic equipment, emergency shipments, overnight packages, etc. Timely delivery of these goods has been an important element of many manufacturing and service operations in California. Therefore, the air cargo industry is {{a vital part of the}} State's economy. Continued ability of the State's air cargo industry to serve the other industries in the State and the State's ability to capitalize on the forecast growth of air cargo routes between Pacific-Rim countries in Asia and North America are essential to the prosperity of California. However, future demand on California's air cargo system may continue to outpace the future supply of the system's capacity. Faced with these challenges, Caltrans began a systematic investigation into the role of air cargo in California's goods movement, as part of the larger development effort for a statewide goods movement strategy, and funded a research project in 1997 for the Institute of Transportation Studies at U. C. Berkeley to (i) gain a broader understanding of the State's air cargo industry and the role of air cargo in California's goods movement, (ii) assess the importance of air cargo to the State's economy, (iii) begin identification of issues hindering efficient air cargo movement in the State, and (iv) explore possible State roles for resolving the issues. This "white paper" documents the findings of that research and serves as an input to the development of the Statewide Goods Movement Strategy.

In so doing, we use a unique dataset that consists of the entire universe of El Salvador's export transactions over the period 2007 - 2013 and includes information on the transactions channeled under a new transit regime established with neighboring countries over the same period. Results suggest that this new transit system {{has been associated with}} decreased order servicing and variable trade costs. As a consequence, firms' exports increased primarily through higher shipping frequencies. Furthermore, the effects have been strong on foreign sales of <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods.</b> This evidence informs one of the main policies covered in the 2013 WTO Agreement of Trade Facilitation...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{determine}} how time delays affect international trade using newly collected World Bank {{data on the}} days it takes to move standard cargo from the factory gate to the ship in 126 countries. They estimate a modified gravity equation, controlling for endogeneity and remoteness. On average, each additional day that a product is delayed prior to being shipped reduces trade by at least 1 percent. Put differently, each day is equivalent to a country distancing itself from its trade partners by 70 kilometers on average. Delays have an even greater impact on developing country exports and exports of <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods,</b> such as perishable agricultural products. In particular, a day's delay reduces a country's relative exports of time-sensitive to time-insensitive agricultural goods by 6 percent.

40|$|Abstract We {{determine}} how time delays affect international trade, using newlycollected {{data on the}} days it takes to move standard cargo from the factory gate to the ship in 98 countries. We estimate a difference gravity equation that controls for remoteness, and find significant effects of time costs on trade. We find that each additional day that a product is delayed prior to being shipped reduces trade {{by more than one}} percent. Put differently, each day is equivalent to a country distancing itself from its trade partners by about 70 km on average. We control for potential endogeneity using a sample of landlocked countries and instrument for time delays with export times that occur in neighboring countries. We also find that delays have an even greater impact on exports of <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods,</b> such as perishable agricultural products. Our results highlight the importance of reducing trade costs (as opposed to tariff barriers) to stimulate exports...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of transit, documentation, and ports and customs delays on Africa's exports. We find that transit delays have the most {{economically}} and statically significant effect on exports. A one day reduction in inland travel times leads to a 7 percent increase in exports. Put another way, a one day reduction in inland travel times translates into 1. 5 percentage point decrease in all importing-country tariffs. In contrast, longer delays in the other areas have a far smaller impact on trade. We control for the possibility that greater trade leads to shorter delays in three ways. First, we examine the effect of trade times on exports of new products. Second, we evaluate the effect of delays in a transit country on the exports of landlocked countries. Third, we examine whether delays affect <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods</b> relatively more. We show that large transit delays are relatively more harmful because of high within-country variation...|$|E
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that added time to export adds cost to and lowers the volume of trade. Time delays may also affect the {{composition}} of trade and can disproportionately reduce trade in <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods.</b> This paper investigates the validity of these propositions using the World Bank Doing Business database and Enterprise Surveys for 64 developing countries. The authors find that in countries where there is longer time needed to export firms in time-sensitive industries {{are less likely to}} become exporters. Moreover, firms that do export have lower export intensities. Their findings imply that time to export is a significant determinant of comparative advantage. For example, consider two industries that have the same export probability and intensity - but differ in time-sensitivity by one standard deviation. Action taken to cut time to export by 50 percent for one industry opens a 6 percentage point difference between the export probabilities of the two industries. In addition, steps to cut time delays increase export intensities by 1. 9 percentage points. This impact applies to industries with different productivity levels [...] and those in developing countries with different income levels.

40|$|Air freight {{transport}} plays {{a vital role}} in Germany’s foreign trade and contributes to Germany’s position as one of the leading exporting countries worldwide. Although the volume of air freight accounts for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of air freight exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, air {{freight transport}} forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and <b>time-sensitive</b> <b>goods.</b> However, only relatively little research has been conducted in air transport with regard to the spatial differentiated generation and distribution of air freight compared to the state of research in passenger transport. The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of air freight on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific air freight demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Building on these findings, the distribution of the regionally generated air freight is explored by modelling the airport choice behaviour of the air freight forwarders using a discrete choice approach. ...|$|E
