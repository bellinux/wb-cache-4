5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed.</b> The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|The domesticated cat and {{its closest}} wild {{ancestor}} are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. About 250 heritable genetic disorders {{have been identified}} in cats, many similar to human inborn errors. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models {{in the study of the}} human diseases.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{systematic}} review (analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide) found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as {{number of sexual}} partners, and sexual-health status.

25|$|An {{estimated}} 12,900 new {{cervical cancer}}s and 4,100 cervical cancer deaths {{will occur in}} the United States in 2015. In the United States, it is the eight-most common cancer of women. The median age at diagnosis is 48. Hispanic women are significantly more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with cervical cancer than the general population. In 1998, about 12,800 women were diagnosed in the US and about 4,800 died. In 2014, an estimated 12,360 new cases were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> and about 4,020 were expected to die of cervical cancer. Among cancers of the female reproductive tract it is less common than endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. The rates of new cases in the United States was 7 per 100,000 women in 2004. Cervical cancer deaths decreased by approximately 74% in the last 50 years, largely due to widespread Pap smear screening. The annual direct medical cost of cervical cancer prevention and treatment prior to introduction of the HPV vaccine was estimated at $6 billion.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to feel as though {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives times more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{criteria}} for {{impaired fasting glucose}} differs from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently by each. Fasting plasma glucose levels 100mg/dL (5.5mmol/L) and higher {{have been shown to}} increase complication rates significantly, however, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110mg/dL for fear of causing too many people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as having impaired fasting glucose, whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting plasma glucose under 100mg/dL.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} anxiety {{disorders}} {{is a combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a history of child abuse, family history of mental disorders, and poverty. Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> symptoms typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Other problems that may result in similar symptoms including hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine, alcohol, or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.|$|E
