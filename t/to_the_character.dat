After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma.

5|$|Well {{received}} by the show's fans, writers and directors, Abra has established an enduring popularity which has seen Edmondson invited back to the programme regularly.

5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Moore's use for cigars {{in his early}} films put him {{in contrast to the}} cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} of Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the film rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character,</b> and writer Zak Penn {{began work on}} a sequel titled The Incredible Hulk. However, Edward Norton rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a reboot; director Louis Leterrier agreed with this approach.

5|$|Although it {{made little}} impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel Love Among the Chickens {{contained}} what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge.

Wodehouse would return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> in short stories {{over the next six}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Amrish Puri as Mola Ram: A Thuggee {{priest who}} {{performs}} rituals of human sacrifices. The character {{is named after}} a 17th-century Indian painter.

On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
