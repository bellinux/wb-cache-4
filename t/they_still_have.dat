5|$|The Big Four's {{dominance}} record diminishes {{when only}} two of them have competed in an event, but overall <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a 70% success rate, winning 45 of the 64 tournaments in this category, and a success rate of 82%, winning 27 of 33 tournaments, since 2008.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|Wada had {{stated in}} 2006, while the {{development}} and release of Compilation titles was still ongoing, that the Compilation could remain an active franchise until 2017, the twentieth anniversary of Final Fantasy VIIs release. After finishing work on Advent Children Complete, the team announced that they would {{take a break from}} the series, although they stated that <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> various ideas for future titles. In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending with the release of Crisis Core. Their reasoning was that releasing any more would saturate the market.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have.</b> The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{some very}} {{primitive}} character states, the Coxoplectoptera rather looked like early Paleozoic ancestors of mayflies, e.g. in the wing venation of the adult stage <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> the elongate costal brace that is not fused to the costal margin, and in the larval stage <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> articulated lateral wing pads.

Animals with this complexity {{are said to have}} secondary consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Words do {{not enter}} the Interlingua {{vocabulary}} solely because cognates exist in {{a sufficient number of}} languages.

25|$|Though {{extraversion}} and neuroticism seem to {{have the}} largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being.

While the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or neuroticism, it is clear that <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some impact on happiness outcomes.|$|E
