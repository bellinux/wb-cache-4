[...] After developing a prototype with his assistant, Paul Wenke, Corson gave the suggestion to the company who later filed for a patent in his name. The initial intent of the device was to [...] "allow a person to fill more than one barrel gasoline at the same time." [...] This mechanism eventually developed into the modern gasoline pump cut-off valve.|$|E

50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic <b>shut-off</b> and bypass <b>valves</b> were installed for Plant 2. <b>The</b> <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the bypass valves will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014. The project raised the installed capacity of the power plant from 44.4 MW to 53.9 MW.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} tasks when designing the water fittings is to calculate the orifice area of locking pair for passing the calculated water flow at a calculated pressure.

The proposed method allows us to determine the required size of the orifice area for passing the calculated water flow and also to determine the water flow rate depending on the opening level of orifice. The authors carried out the necessary calculations and manufactured ceramic disk type locking pairs by using the proposed method. Bench tests of water fittings with valve heads those are having orifices with smoothly changing shapes (in the form of bent blob) showed that water flow is changing almost in proportional to the tap opening.

30|$|In the {{simulation}} of drilling rig site test, the signal receiving short section is adjusted and connected {{between the two}} drill collars of the near bit and into the well with the drilling tool. One end of the ground information, downloading device is connected with the three-way connecting pipe of the high-pressure riser pipe, and the other end is connected with the mud tank back-flow port. The flow valve opens to a pre-designed opening to open <b>the</b> <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> between the standpipe and the information drop unit. When the signal reception short reaches the underground predetermined depth, the mud pump is turned on to establish the circulation condition. After the mud pump is stable, save the pump pressure to maintain a certain pump pressure, and then, use the computer control information to realize the different time intervals, the preset pressure pulse signal is sent out. The signal receiving short section receives the pulse signal from the ground pressure in the well bottom and stores it. According to the test results, {{it can be seen}} that the increase of the flow valve opening and the increase of the pump pressure have obvious improvement on the information transmission. The deeper the depth of field, the greater the impact on information delivery. The width of the pulse width increases; the information has significantly improved, especially in the depth of the case; but more than a certain value of the effect is not obvious, the pulse width interval value of 9  s or so; to improve the information pass to take the signal suppression approach, that is, to increase the signal gap on the ground, so that the original received useful signal is much larger than the noise. In the process of information transmission, the depth, pump pressure, pulse width, and flow valve open four factors together, because the depth and pump pressure by the engineering conditions, so the quantitative flow valve opening and pulse width interval is the important factors that should be identified before work.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for ensuring the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation's natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Regulations adopted by PHMSA for gas pipelines are provided in 49 CFR 192, and spacing requirements for valves in gas transmission pipelines are presented in 49 CFR 192. 179. The present report describes {{the findings of a}} scoping study conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assist PHMSA in assessing the safety impact of system valve spacing. Calculations of the pressures, temperatures, and flow velocities during a set of representative pipe depressurization transients were carried out using a one-dimensional numerical model with either ideal gas or real gas properties for the fluid. With both ideal gas and real gas properties, the high-consequence area radius for any resulting fire as defined by Stevens in GRI- 00 / 0189 was evaluated as one measure of the pipeline safety. In the real gas case, a model for convective heat transfer from the pipe wall is included to assess <b>the</b> potential for <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> failures due to excessively low temperatures resulting from depressurization cooling of the pipe. A discussion is also provided of some additional factors by which system valve spacing could affect overall pipeline safety. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) Using an adaptation of the Stephens hazard radius criteria, valve spacing has a negligible influence on natural gas pipeline safety for the pipeline diameter, pressure range, and valve spacings considered in this study. (2) Over the first 30 s of the transient, pipeline pressure has a far greater effect on the hazard radius calculated with the Stephens criteria than any variations in the transient flow decay profile and the average discharge rate. (3) Other factors besides the Stephens criteria, such as the longer burn time for an accidental fire, greater period of danger to emergency personnel, increased unavoidable loss of gas, and possible depressurization cooling of <b>the</b> <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> may also be important when deciding whether a change in the required valve spacing would be beneficial from a safety standpoint. (4) The average normalized discharge rate of {lambda}{sub avg} = 0. 33 assumed by Stephens in developing his safety criteria is an excellent conservative value for natural gas discharge at the pressures, valve spacings, and pipe diameter used in this study. This conclusion remains valid even when real rather than ideal gas properties are considered in the analysis. (5) Significant pipe wall cooling effects (T{sub w} < - 50 F or 228 K) can extend for a mile or more upstream from the rupture point within 30 s of a break. These conditions are colder than the temperature range specifications for many valve lubricants. The length of the low-temperature zone due to this cooling effect is also essentially independent of <b>the</b> system <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> spacing or <b>the</b> distance between the break and a compressor station. (6) Having more redundant <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> available would reduce the probability that pipe cooling effects could interfere with isolating the broken area following a pipeline rupture accident...|$|R
40|$|The {{work of the}} gas {{transmission}} {{pipeline system}} is regulated by the thousands of valveses and other elements of <b>the</b> <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves,</b> located in different places. Information about {{the current status of}} each valve, and confidence in its technical serviceability is an important element in the control of pipeline system. There are a number of problems that adversely affect the  valving operation. Principal among them - is the lack of siystematical approach in valving diagnostics. To solve this problem, developed a new approach to the valving diagnostics – multi-level diagnostics. Depending on the level of diagnosis, we get a different amount of information about the object.   The focus is on the 3 rd level of diagnosis, which allows to determine the leackages of valves, and identify type of defects quantitatively. This level of diagnosis is regarded as an example of Method «Micropuls». The method «Micropuls» based on the theory of mechanical vibrations and forced with high accuracy to set the time, frequency and spectral characteristics of noise in the details of the valve, and their spatial location and intensity of that {{in the presence of a}} system of analysis allows to determine the state of the object, its faults and defects. Micropulse technology is based on the impact on the measured object micropower impulses, records the response and subsequent filtering, decoding and analyzing the data.                    Specially designed calibrated pulses can effectively influence the measured objects (valve) over a wide range of structural dimensions and mounting schemes, regardless of physical location of the valve. ...|$|R

50|$|A certain minimum supply {{pressure}} {{is needed to}} drive the air through the system, but it is desired to use as low a {{supply pressure}} as possible, because the energy the engine uses to compress the bleed air is not available for propulsion, and fuel consumption suffers. For this reason, air is commonly drawn from one of two (or in some cases such as the Boeing 777, three) bleed ports at different compressor stage locations. When the engine is at low pressure (low thrust or high altitude), the air is drawn from the highest pressure bleed port. As pressure is increased (more thrust or lower altitude) and reaches a predetermined crossover point, <b>the</b> high pressure <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> (HPSOV) closes and air is selected from a lower pressure port to minimize the fuel performance loss. The reverse happens as engine pressure decreases.|$|R
50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as <b>the</b> service <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|R

40|$|The {{emergency}} disconnection {{system and}} recoil analysis {{is required for}} every offshore drilling unit. Situations can occur where the vessel needs to disconnect from the well, {{it can be to}} large forces that are being transferred to the wellhead or that the vessel is unable to maintain its position over the well. When the tensioned riser is released between the BOP and LMRP it will accelerate upwards due to released tension and unbalanced force from the tensioners, this is referred to as riser recoil. The riser tensioner system is essential for understanding the recoil and it is presented in this thesis. This system gives the force variation when the riser retracts and contains <b>the</b> <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> used in <b>the</b> anti recoil system for slowing down the riser. This thesis has focused on the use of SIMA RIFLEX as the tool for making a complete recoil analysis. Modelling issues are discussed on how well the physical phenomena of the recoil can be implemented in RIFLEX. Special attention have been given to force variation and damping in the riser tensioner system. Mass loss and friction forces when the high density mud inside the riser discharges. Slowing down the riser with the anti recoil system. None of these issues can be modelled directly in RIFLEX, and requires pre processing and simplifications. Two models were developed for the use in RILFEX, one for 500 meters water depth and one for 1500 meters water depth simulating a drift-off scenario. Impact between the BOP and LMRP is an issue if the riser does not achieve enough lift off after disconnection. A worst-case scenario was set up for the 500 m model in irregular waves. No impact occurred for different disconnection timings in the selected wave. However it was found that an impact could be plausible in larger waves. In the drift-off simulation resulting bending moments on the BOP and wellhead is of focus. The built in slug model in RIFLEX was attempted used for modelling of the mass loss. It was found that the slug model does not work for a complex riser, and an alternative model was developed. By specifying dynamical nodal forces in the global system, forces can be saved to the nodes of the riser. Then both the mass and the force representing the mass loss will be saved to the same nodes, but in different matrices. The alternative model provided a good lift off from the BOP, but does not change the actual mass of the system. Compression will be another problem induced by the forces lifting the riser. SIMA RIFLEX proved to lack some modelling options to serve well for a recoil analysis. </p...|$|R
