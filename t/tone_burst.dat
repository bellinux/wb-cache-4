This is {{explained}} by von Bekesy's findings that the cochlea has an asymmetrical filter function effect. This asymmetry and higher travelling wave velocity at the base explains why the ABR is biased towards the high frequencies. For a low-frequency <b>tone</b> <b>burst,</b> the travelling wave velocity is greatest at the base than at the apex. For low frequency tone bursts, the displacement is largest in the apex. The neural response is synchronous only over a short distance of the apex. The response is broader {{due to lack of}} neural synchrony.

40|$|Abstract—Effective {{objective}} HF (high-frequency) {{testing methodology}} {{provides for the}} early detection of ototoxic hear-ing loss because it typically progresses from high to low fre-quencies. Such early detection is considered necessary to prevent hearing loss from progressing into the frequency range important for understanding speech. Objective tests must be reliable, sensitive to hearing change, and time efficient. Audi-tory brainstem responses (ABRs) appear well suited to this task; however, current ABR techniques have limitations. Con-ventional clicks stimulate middle (1 – 4 kHz) rather than high frequencies (> 8 kHz). Responses to HF <b>tone</b> <b>bursts</b> require con-siderable recording time. We hypothesized that using HF band-limited clicks (HF clicks) could overcome these limitations. Two different HF clicks, with bandwidths of 8 – 14 kHz were used to elicit ABRs. The current study compared responses among these stimuli. The results demonstrate the reliability of HF-click responses and of <b>tone</b> <b>bursts</b> presented in trains.

A typical tone scheme might use the tones 1,800 Hz, 2,000 Hz, 2,200 Hz, 2,400 Hz, and 2,552 Hz. This was the scheme used by most State of California agencies during the era when <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> was in use. Some systems have been observed to use tones as low as 800 Hz. The default or standard five Motorola tones used for single tone format as of the 1980s: 1,350 Hz, 1,500 Hz, 1,650 Hz, 1,800 Hz, 1,950 Hz. These were identified in system documentation {{for a number of}} remote control equipment models as well as sales brochures for Motorola Syntor and Micor mobile radio Systems 90 accessories.

For processing of the data, the results from the individual <b>tone</b> <b>bursts</b> were combined offline to form a composite response. This was then compared with the response obtained with the complex stimulus. Results revealed close correspondence between the spectra of the complex and composite responses in all ears despite interindividual differences in response morphology. Correlations between the complex and composite waveforms exceeded 80 % for all stimulus levels. Subtractions of the two spectra revealed {{that the majority of the}} differences occurred at frequencies on the high-frequency slopes of the l- and 2 -kHz spectral peaks. This was due to a reduction in energy for the responses obtained with the complex stimulus. There was little variation between the two response types in the peak frequencies of their spectra, in the energy at frequencies on the lower frequency sides of the spectral peaks at 1 and 2 kHz, or in the spectral components at 3 kHz.

50|$|Researchers at Harvard University {{have created}} a brain-to-brain {{interface}} (BBI) between a human and a Sprague-Dawley rat. Simply by thinking the appropriate thought, the BBI allows the human to control the rat's tail. The human wears an EEG-based brain-to-computer interface (BCI), while the anesthetised rat {{is equipped with a}} focused ultrasound (FUS) computer-to-brain interface (CBI). FUS is a technology that allows the researchers to excite a specific region of neurons in the rat's brain using an ultrasound signal (350 kHz ultrasound frequency, <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> duration of 0.5 ms, pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, given for 300 ms duration). The main advantage of FUS is that, unlike most brain-stimulation techniques, it is non-invasive. Whenever the human looks at a specific pattern (strobe light flicker) on a computer screen, the BCI communicates a command to the rat's CBI, which causes ultrasound to be beamed into the region of the rat's motor cortex responsible for tail movement. The researchers report that the human BCI has an accuracy of 94%, and that it generally takes around 1.5 s from the human looking at the screen to movement of the rat's tail.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to assess saccular function through use of the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP). The cVEMP response is a middle latency (P1 between 12-20 ms) waveform denoting inhibition of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle ipsilateral to the stimulus. While not truly a unilateral reflex (response waveforms can be detected in the SCM contralateral to the stimulus in approximately 40% of cases), cVEMPs are more unilateral than the closely related ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The most reliable points on the cVEMP waveform are known as P1 and N1. Of all waveform characteristics, P1-N1 amplitude is the most reliable and clinically relevant. cVEMP amplitude is linearly dependent upon stimulus intensity and is most reliably elicited with a loud (generally at or above 95 dB nHL) click or <b>tone</b> <b>burst.</b> The cVEMP can also {{be said to be}} low-frequency tuned, with largest amplitudes in response to 500-750 Hz tonebursts.

50|$|In {{experiments}} using heart-rate conditioning, Pigeons {{have been}} found to be able to detect sounds in the infrasonic range at frequencies as low as 0.5 Hz. For frequencies below 10 Hz, the pigeon threshold is at about 55 dB which is at least 50 dB more sensitive than humans. Pigeons are able to discriminate small frequency differences in sounds at between 1 Hz and 20 Hz, with sensitivity ranging from a 1% shift at 20 Hz to a 7% shift at 1 Hz. Sensitivities are measured through a heart-rate conditioning test. In this test, an anesthetized bird is presented with a single sound or a sequence of sounds, followed by an electric shock. The bird’s heart-rate will increase in anticipation of a shock. Therefore, a measure of the heart-rate can determine whether the bird is able to distinguish between stimuli that would be followed by a shock from stimuli that would not. Similar methods have also been used to determine the pigeon’s sensitivity to barometric pressure changes, polarized light, and UV light. These experiments were conducted in sound isolation chambers to avoid the influence of ambient noise. Infrasonic stimuli are hard to produce and are often transmitted through a filter that attenuates higher frequency components. Also, the <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> stimuli used in these experiments were presented with stimulus onset and offsets ramped on and off gradually in order to prevent initial turn-on and turn-off transients.|$|E
40|$|There is {{conflict}} in the literature over whether individual frequency components of a transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) are generated within relatively independent “channels” along the basilar membrane (BM), or whether each component may be generated by widespread areas of the BM. Two previous studies on TEOAE suppression are consistent with generation within largely independent channels, but {{with a degree of}} interaction between nearby channels. However, both these studies reported significant suppression only at high stimulus levels, at which the “nonlinear” presentation paradigm was used. The present study clarifies the separate influences of stimulus level and presentation paradigm on this type of suppression. TEOAEs were recorded using stimulus <b>tone</b> <b>bursts</b> at 1, 2 and 3 kHz and a complex stimulus consisting of a digital addition of the three <b>tone</b> <b>bursts,</b> over a range of stimulus levels and both “linear” and “nonlinear” presentation paradigms.

It is further argued that the data support the “local” rather than “widespread” model of TEOAE generation, subject to nonlinear interactions between nearby generation channels.

40|$|Objective: The air {{conduction}} click {{is currently the}} most widespread stimulus used to estimate the pure tone audiogram as part of auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing. The click is characterized by its broad spectral content and rapid onset, which may not make it {{the best choice for}} frequency specificity. An alternative stimulus is a short duration <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> stimuli with notched noise masking. When obtaining an ABR using standard unmasked tone bursts, the brief stimulus onset may cause spectral splatter producing response contributions from unwanted regions of the cochlea; thus reducing the frequency specificity of the ABR. Notched noise masking used in conjunction with the <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> ABR, limits the evoked response to those frequencies within the notch, thereby reducing the likelihood of spectral splatter and increasing frequency specificity. The presence of a sloping sensory hearing impairment creates additional difficulties for achieving frequency specificity because of the likelihood that lower frequency cochlea regions, with less sensory damage, will contribute to the evoked response. It is theorized that notched noise masking will reduce the neural contributions from regions of the cochlear outside those within the notch, resulting in more frequency specific results than those achieved with a standard unmasked <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> stimulus. The present study was designed to investigate the differences in Wave V latency between the notched noise ABR and the standard unmasked <b>tone</b> <b>burst</b> ABR as a measure of frequency specificity. Design: Twenty-five participants with normal hearing in at least one ear and 16 participants with bilateral SNHL participated in this investigation.
