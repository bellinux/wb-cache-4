5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus, and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legions of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E
5|$|The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, {{has been}} {{shocked by the}} murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the {{attempted}} murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has {{been sent to the}} town to investigate, and has come to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killer was possessed by a demonic entity—Killer BOB (Frank Silva). MIKE (Al Strobel), a similar spirit, has spoken to Cooper and his FBI superior, Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch), explaining the nature of their existence.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> National Park Service {{does not represent}} the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

50|$|Forced {{displacement}} has accompanied persecution, {{as well as}} war, {{throughout human}} history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention {{is the result of}} greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region.|$|R

He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E

His success followed <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> right grapes could grow in the cold climate, producing an inexpensive good wine that could reach a commercial market. He gained government support and raised the capital for a commercial-scale vineyard and winery. His financial success encouraged others to enter the business.|$|E

25|$|Ugyen Wangchuck's {{emergence}} {{as the national}} leader coincided with <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dual political system was obsolete and ineffective.

When the last Zhabdrung died in 1903 and a reincarnation had not appeared by 1906, civil administration came under the control of Ugyen Wangchuck. Finally, in 1907, the fifty-fourth and last Druk Desi was forced to retire, and despite recognitions of subsequent reincarnations of Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung system came to an end.|$|E
25|$|With {{increases}} in fuel capacity as the type was refined, {{the range of}} escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids {{all the way into}} Germany. On the way back from the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P-47 could perform a dual-function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home.|$|E
25|$|Though {{scholars}} {{may differ}} in their interpretation of text, the central idea {{seems to be very}} clear. Sonnet 126 deals with a marked lapse of time and leads the reader to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship between author and subject has continued on for years but has now begun to wane or fizzle out. Ramsey too believes that the central idea rests in the reality of the natural relation that must be paid and the truth that must be faced by the author.

25|$|At {{its peak}} {{the total of}} shield volunteers in Baghdad {{numbered}} about 500, but <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> thousands needed {{to have a chance}} of stopping attacks on Baghdad had not materialized, combined with the failure of the United Nations to forestall war, meant that bombing was imminent. Many of the shields chose to stay; many others chose to leave. Still others, like O’Keefe, were ordered out by the Iraqi government. One 21-year-old human shield, Tom Hurndall, left Baghdad for reasons of safety. He went to the Palestinian territories where he was shot by an Israeli soldier while working with the International Solidarity Movement.|$|E
25|$|Full VTOL {{testing at}} Edwards AFB was delayed pending the {{availability}} of the 7,100 shp Allison YT54, which never materialized. After the brief unintentional hop, the aircraft made a total of 32 flights. All further XFV-1 flights did not involve any vertical takeoffs or landings. The XFV-1 was able to make a few transitions in flight from the conventional to the vertical flight mode and back, and had briefly held in hover at altitude. Performance remained limited by the confines of the flight test regime. With <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> XFV's top speeds would be eclipsed by contemporary fighters and that only highly experienced pilots could fly the aircraft, the project was cancelled in June 1955.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} September 11 attacks, Searle {{wrote an article}} arguing that the attacks were a {{particular}} event in a long-term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States, and signaled support for a more aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy. He called for <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States is in a more-or-less permanent state of war with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks.

Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, {{or out of}} the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.|$|E

50|$|Resacralization is {{the return}} of {{religious}} meanings to public sectors of social life such as politics, the arts, and the body, and the resistance of secularization. This is consistent with Berger's (1967) definition of secularization as the removal of religious meanings from public life, or privatization. Another possible definition of resacralization would be <b>the</b> growing <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> separation {{between public and private}} spheres is itself a cultural construction of modern society.|$|R

25|$|The Hellenic Trench of the Hellenic arc {{system is}} unusual because this {{convergent}} margin subducts evaporites. The {{slope of the}} surface of the southern flank of the Mediterranean Ridge (its accretionary prism) is low, about 1°, indicating very low shear stress on the decollement {{at the base of the}} wedge. Evaporites control the shallow taper of the accretionary complex both because their mechanical properties differ from those of siliciclastic sediments, and because of their effect on fluid flow and fluid pressure, which in turn control effective stress. In the 1970s, the linear deeps of the Hellenic trench south of Crete were thought to be similar to trenches at other subduction zones. However, with <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Ridge is an accretionary complex, it became apparent that the Hellenic trench is actually a starved forearc basin, and that the plate boundary lies south of the Mediterranean Ridge.|$|E
25|$|Throughout European and American history, {{upper class}} and upper-middle-class {{families}} had a prevailing attitude of ignoring their servants {{until they were}} needed for labor. Servants {{were expected to be}} silent and they had little opportunity to report criminal behavior within their own living/work environment. The American system of slavery, even in the post-emancipation era, took expectations of invisibility and powerlessness of servants to the extreme. Enslaved Africans found themselves in a position in which they were left to deal, without support of the law or society, the immoral slavery in the United States.Thus, due to lack of food and no pay, servants would often resort to petty theft. After enslaved blacks were emancipated, they made efforts to move beyond domestic work and manual labor, but many came to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only work available to them was domestic work or manual labor (both positions paid very little).
