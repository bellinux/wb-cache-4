5|$|The {{opposition}} middle szlachta movement {{came up with}} {{a constructive}} reform program during the Kraków sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received news that the Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that he thought was much larger than his while having no easy way to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E

60|$|Muller {{allowed himself}} <b>to</b> be <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. His arm in Mr. Snyder's grip felt limp. Mrs. Pickett stopped and took {{something}} from the debris on the floor. She rose, holding the harmonica.|$|R
5|$|Operation Tractable {{began at}} 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German {{positions}} along the front. As with Totalize, {{many of the}} bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a smoke screen laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By {{the end of the}} first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front, with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September, the Syrian army also mobilized {{reinforcements}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> government-held {{cities of}} al-Harra, al-Sanamayn, al-Jidiya and Zimrin in Daraa province.|$|E
25|$|However, Parco, Rapoport and Stein (2002) {{illustrated}} {{that the}} level of financial incentives can {{have a profound effect on}} the outcome in a three-player game: the larger the incentives are for deviation, the greater propensity for learning behavior in a repeated single-play experimental design <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Nash equilibrium.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it needs}} overhauling, and I {{am going to}} have it fixed up," [...] was Slade's answer, and began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> off <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Hall, {{dragging}} his bob after him.|$|R
60|$|Without {{making any}} sign to his {{companion}} he began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> noiselessly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> new-comer {{on his hands}} and knees, arriving {{at the edge of the}} bushes just as Joe had passed.|$|R
50|$|For enough {{sail area}} to propel {{a fishing boat}} the mizzen mast has <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> middle of the boat which allows its sail to be bigger without {{upsetting}} the sail balance or distribution.|$|R
25|$|The {{patient is}} then quickly moved {{so they are}} lying on the {{unaffected}} side with their head {{in the same position}} (now facing downwards 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> exit of the ear canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} over {{blame for the}} disaster at Little Bighorn continues to this day. Major Marcus Reno's failure to press his attack on {{the south end of}} the Lakota/Cheyenne village and his flight to the timber along the river after a single casualty have been cited as a factor in the destruction of Custer's battalion, as has Captain Frederick Benteen's allegedly tardy arrival on the field, and the failure of the two officers' combined forces <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> relief of Custer.|$|E
25|$|A {{little after}} noon the Union {{soldiers}} began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Confederate lines, and {{at about the}} same time the rains began. The road was soon turned into mud, and the mere act of walking required great exertion. The gunners with the howitzers accompanying the infantry soon were exhausted trying to move their pieces, so a regiment of infantry (51st Pennsylvania) were detailed to help them. Many of those foot soldiers long remembered this as the most arduous part of the battle.|$|E

60|$|Slugger and Nappy {{had just}} started <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lake shore, {{intending}} to sneak behind some rocks and bushes, when they heard Fred give a loud shout from {{the entrance to the}} second cabin. Then Andy gave a long whistle.|$|R
25|$|The Tropical waltz was {{performed}} {{in a slower tempo}} and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by a brief anacrusis but had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.|$|E
25|$|The strikers {{continued}} to sporadically {{fire on the}} barges. Union members took potshots at the ships from their rowboats and the steam-powered launch. The burgess of Homestead, John McLuckie, issued a proclamation at 6:00a.m. asking for townspeople to help defend the peace; more than 5,000 people congregated on the hills overlooking the steelworks. A 20-pounder brass cannon was {{set up on the}} shore opposite the steel mill, and an attempt was made to sink the barges. Six miles away in Pittsburgh, thousands of steelworkers gathered in the streets, listening to accounts of the attacks at Homestead; hundreds, many of them armed, began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> town to assist the strikers.|$|E
25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center of the tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E

50|$|The Bank {{is engaged}} in {{policies}} to promote financial inclusion {{and is a member}} of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). On 20 December 2012, the member institution announced specific commitments toward AFI's Maya Declaration <b>to</b> <b>move</b> further <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> eradication of financial exclusion in Sierra Leone.|$|R
25|$|In the aftermaths of the Ganlu Incident, Li Shi and Zheng Tan {{were made}} chancellors, and {{while most of}} the power {{remained}} in the leading eunuchs' hands, it was said because of a severely worded petition filed by the military governor Liu Congjian objecting to the deaths of Wang Ya and Jia, the powerful eunuchs began to show some restraint, allowing Emperor Wenzong and the chancellors to have some ability to govern. Meanwhile, Li Zongmin was moved closer to the capital, to be the military advisor to the prefect of Heng Prefecture (modern Hengyang in Hunan). Henceforth, the officials accused of being partisans of Li Zongmin and Li Deyu were beginning to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> capital.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Deming was {{introduced}} to Walter A. Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the control chart, as Deming began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow police {{decided to}} use the {{occasion}} of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage. A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the woman with the revolver.|$|E
50|$|Nakajima {{also started}} the 2014 {{season in the}} minor leagues. Some {{commentators}} speculated that Nakajima would need to improve his defense, e.g., learning how <b>to</b> <b>move</b> faster <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ball on MLB's grass infields and being more aggressive around the bag, before his play was up to Major League standards.|$|R
50|$|Charge {{trapping}} flash is erased via hot {{hole injection}} (See Hot-carrier injection) {{as opposed to}} the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling approach used in both NAND and NOR flash for erasure. This process uses a field, rather than the current used in FN, <b>to</b> <b>move</b> holes <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> charge trapping layer to remove the charge.|$|R
60|$|He was {{stricken}} speechless with terror, {{but he did}} {{not lose}} the preternatural clearness of his faculties, and he never took his eyes off the woman.

25|$|On 17 May the Coalition columns {{were ordered}} to begin moving {{in order to get}} into their proper positions. The Count of Clerfayt with 19,600 {{soldiers}} was directed to advance south from Tielt, cross the Leie (Lys) River at Wervik and reach Tourcoing. The other five columns were ordered <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest from the area of Tournai. Farthest north were Von dem Bussche's 4,000 Hanoverians. From north to south the other columns were Rudolf Ritter von Otto with 10,000 men, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany with 10,750 troops, Kinsky with 11,000 soldiers and Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen with 18,000 men. Kinsky and Charles were expected to defeat Jacques Philippe Bonnaud's division. Mack's plan was too ambitious and only Otto and York reached their proper stations at nightfall on 17 May. Clerfayt only began crossing the Leie at 1:00 AM. Bussche ran into stiff opposition, was drubbed and chased out of the area. Otto held Tourcoing and York reached Mouvaux. Kinsky and Charles pushed back Bonnaud's troops but Kinsky did not get farther than Bouvines and Charles was south instead of east of Lille.|$|E
500|$|A second male nude, St. John the Baptist Preaching, was {{completed}} in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of surmoulage by making the statue larger than life: St. John stands almost 6' 7" [...] (2m). While The Age of Bronze is statically posed, St. John gestures and seems <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground– a physical impossibility, and a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, [...] "display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively".|$|E
500|$|On October6, a {{tropical}} depression formed about [...] east of Antigua, {{near where the}} previous hurricane developed. The depression proceeded northward, and was detected by the Hurricane Hunters on October7.

By the time it reached peak intensity, the hurricane had turned sharply to the east, and later began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south. As quickly as it strengthened, Easy began to weaken, and an aircraft reported winds of only [...] on October9. The storm headed southwest, ultimately dissipating on October11 about [...] southwest of where it formed. Easy never affected land.|$|E
60|$|Harvey led the way, and on {{arriving}} at the gate it {{was found to be}} an extremely difficult point at which to effect an entrance, because of its height, therefore the plan was so far changed as <b>to</b> <b>move</b> farther <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear of the building, where the party began clambering the wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> eastward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Mulde River, capturing Zwickau by 17 April. The advance was halted, 23 April, {{and from}} then until VE-day, the division saw only limited action, engaging in patrolling and general security. Three towns, Lößnitz, Aue, and Stollberg, were kept under constant pressure, but no attacks were launched.|$|R
