5|$|By the 1990s {{the club}} had {{demolished}} virtually the whole street and this {{coincided with the}} redevelopment of the Park End stand. However at present the majority of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now an open car park for the club and its Marquee.|$|E
5|$|Forests cover about 57% of the Potlatch River watershed, {{while about}} 38% {{is used for}} {{agriculture}} and ranching. 78% of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> privately owned while 14% lie within national forests. 7% {{is owned by the}} state, while the Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs each have a 1% share.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{purchased by}} a group of Mexican entrepreneurs, led by architect Miguel Quintana Pali. 5 hectares of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> purchased in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of {{annexation}} as the Territory of Hawaii, <b>the</b> former Crown <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> given ("ceded") to the US Federal Government. When the Hawaii Admission Act made Hawaii a U.S. state, <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> transferred to <b>the</b> state. The federal act authorizing the transfer required that <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>be</b> held in trust and that revenue from <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>be</b> used for five purposes: (These excerpts actually came from the Statehood Act 1959) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>is</b> an 88 acre {{historic}} village {{located on}} the Minnesota River just outside downtown Shakopee. <b>The</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>is</b> a working representation of Minnesota life from the 1840s-1890s.|$|R
5|$|Melville Island {{is a small}} {{peninsula}} in Nova Scotia, Canada, {{located in}} the Northwest Arm of Halifax Harbour, west of Deadman's Island. It {{is part of the}} Halifax Regional Municipality. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> rocky, with thin, acidic soil, but supports a limited woodland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Pudús are {{threatened}} {{due to the}} destruction of their rainforest habitat. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.|$|E
5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
50|$|In {{commonwealth}} militaries, a <b>landing</b> zone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cartographic (numeric) zone {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>is</b> {{going to take}} place (e.g., a valley). <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> area <b>is</b> <b>the</b> area in which <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>is</b> {{going to take place}} (e.g., the field where <b>the</b> aircraft <b>are</b> to <b>land).</b> <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> point <b>is</b> <b>the</b> point on which aircraft <b>are</b> going to <b>land</b> (e.g., a point of the field). Each aircraft has a different landing point.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{owned by}} <b>the</b> Bramshill estate until 1952, when it <b>was</b> sold. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> last {{owned by a}} {{manufacturer}} of quarry equipment before the council purchased the site.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> sold in <b>the</b> 13th {{century by}} Thomas Corbet to John son of John Extraneo and the commune of Shrewsbury after which <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> leased or granted to various {{parties in the}} township.|$|R
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the {{converter}} station {{next to the}} Radisson substation, the HVDC line heads south and roughly parallels the six 735kV power lines some distance to the west. It traverses {{the same type of}} terrain as the other six lines; <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> replete with lakes, wetlands, and forested rolling hills. Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located in}} the Indo-Gangetic Plains of North India, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> very fertile because low level floods in the Ganges {{continually}} replenish the soil. Varanasi is located between the Ganges confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around , {{and serves as a}} sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s {{many of the}} {{residents}} were re-housed in nearby areas and <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> cleared to a certain extent. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> then sold by Mr Shahmoon to Croudace Ltd, a property development company.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> 1890s, Anderson <b>Landing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{part of the}} Wilkerson's Plantation, and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>was</b> used to ship cotton.|$|R
50|$|The North Pine Country Park was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Griffin's Whiteside Run. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> selected by James Foreman in 1868 and his original dwelling is the residence of the current park caretaker. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> subsequently purchased by the Hyde family and they continued to farm <b>the</b> <b>land</b> until it <b>was</b> acquired by the council in 1985.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Quex House {{became an}} Auxiliary Military Hospital {{run by the}} Birchington Voluntary Aid Detachment. In 1923, the Memorial Ground was donated to the village by Mr H. A. Erlebach for sport and {{recreational}} use. Mr Erlebach owned the village's now defunct Woodfood House School and purchased land from the Quex House estate for the school. He gave {{the southern part of}} the land to the people of Birchington and dedicated it in memory of his three sons who had been killed in World War I. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> now owned by Thanet District Council.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Landslides {{encompass}} smaller areas, develop on {{the steep}} cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> today completely halted.|$|E
50|$|The Coos Bay Wagon Road <b>Lands</b> <b>is</b> <b>land</b> {{managed by}} <b>the</b> United States Bureau of <b>Land</b> Management. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{granted to the}} Oregon & California Railroad to create a road between Coos Bay, Oregon and Roseburg, Oregon. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> reconveyed to <b>the</b> United States in 1937.|$|R
25|$|It is {{reported}} that Ryan {{knew nothing about}} farming so <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> sold to Robert Campbell in about 1806. Other reliable accounts state that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> sold to Charles Grimes, the Surveyor General who then quickly on-sold to Campbell.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> park's <b>land</b> <b>was</b> bequeathed to <b>the</b> city by {{furniture}} manufacturer John Ainsworth Dunn {{upon his}} death in 1915. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> later transferred to the state.|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{watershed}} of Little Fishing Creek upstream {{of the stream}} gauge on it is forest. There is also agricultural land, especially in the northwestern and southern parts of {{the watershed}} and small areas of developed land in the watershed's southern section. 64.5 {{percent of the land}} in the watershed upstream of Eyers Grove is forested land and 34.7 percent is agricultural land. 0.7 percent of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> developed and the remaining 0.2 percent has other uses.|$|E
5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
5|$|The Close {{owes its}} origins to {{a grant of}} land and {{buildings}} by Walter de Hulle, a canon of Wells Cathedral, {{for the purpose of}} accommodating chantry priests; however <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> likely to have been used for a long period before the construction of the close, as prehistoric flint flakes and Romano-British pottery shards were recovered from the garden of number four during work to construct an extension.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> expropriated in 1948 by the Union of South Africa <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred}} into <b>the</b> {{name of the}} Republic of South Africa in 1961. It currently still {{belongs to}} the Republic of South Africa under Title deed 20006/1948.|$|R
50|$|In 970 <b>the</b> <b>land</b> around Newton and Hauxton {{was passed}} to King Edgar who offered them to Bishop Aethelwold {{for the new}} Abbey at Ely. However, Edgar died before <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} and <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> subject {{to a series of}} disputes until they were purchased for the Abbey.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{donated to}} Manchester City Council by Sir Edward Tootal Broadhurst, a local cotton manufacturer, in {{gratitude}} for Manchester's {{efforts in the}} First World War. Sir Edward gave <b>the</b> <b>land</b> for use as playing fields and a park. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> conveyed to <b>the</b> Council in June 1920.|$|R
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{population}} was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census, {{an increase of}} over 30% since 2001. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming or fishing, and sheep raised on the island {{have a reputation for}} quality. Most of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> owned by the Duke of Argyll, with the farmers being tenants.|$|E
5|$|The main {{economic}} sector in Tubas is agriculture. There {{is a total}} of 150,000 dunams of arable land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>is</b> fertile, {{there is a lack}} of water for irrigation. The only spring used is the nearby Ein Far'a. Field crops account for 49% of the cultivable land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-'Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas' arable lands.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Lake-Tysen House at this location, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} patented to Hanse Laurense circa 1677. By 1723, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> {{owned by}} James Hanse Dye. Any structure had been destroyed, {{but there was}} evidence found of its existence nearby the kitchen area.|$|R
50|$|On all Apollo {{missions}} to <b>the</b> moon, <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> radar <b>was</b> required {{to acquire the}} surface before a <b>landing</b> could <b>be</b> attempted. But on Apollo 14, <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> radar <b>was</b> unable to lock on. Mission control told the astronauts to cycle the power. They did, the radar locked on just in time, and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|The area now {{occupied}} by Lewis County was very sparsely occupied {{until the end}} of the 18th century. Although <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> already claimed by the Province of New York in its original grant, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>was</b> clearly part of the territory of the Iroquois confederacy until after the American Revolutionary War, when New York seized <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> from tribes that had supported <b>the</b> British. <b>The</b> <b>lands</b> <b>were</b> unsurveyed and remained unattractive to settlement until after the complex process of Macomb's Purchase of 1791 eventually put much of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in <b>the</b> hands of John Brown.|$|R
