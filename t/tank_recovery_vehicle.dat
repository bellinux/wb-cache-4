5|$|The M32 entered {{service with}} the US Army in July 1943. They {{served in the}} Italian Campaign, Operation Overlord, and many other battles in the European Theater of Operations. The A1 variants, which were {{converted}} by Baldwin Locomotive in 1945, also served {{until the end of}} the Korean War. The M74 <b>Tank</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicle</b> replaced the M32B1A1s after the Korean War in 1954 after the production of heavier tanks such as the M46 Patton.|$|E
25|$|Companies A, B, C, and D – {{the tank}} line companies, both medium and light, all {{followed}} the same table of organization. Each company consisted of a headquarters section which, along with a small headquarters staff, also included two tanks (one for the company commander {{and one for the}} executive officer); and three five-tank platoons. The medium tank companies were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while the light tank company was equipped with M5 Stuart tanks. All four companies had their own maintenance section, which included an M32 <b>Tank</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> built on a Sherman chassis. Because the Stuart carried a 4-man crew versus a 5-man crew on the Sherman, it had a somewhat smaller personnel strength than the medium tank companies. For the Normandy landings, Companies B and C were equipped with DD tanks. As virtually all these tanks were lost during the assault on D-Day, they were replaced with conventional M4 Shermans as soon as the battalion began receiving replacement equipment.|$|E
500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 9 (also {{known as}} [...] "Famo" [...] ) was a German {{half-track}} that saw widespread use in World War II, and the heaviest half-track vehicle {{of any type}} built in quantity in Nazi Germany during the war years. Its main roles were as a prime mover for very heavy towed guns such as the 24 cm Kanone 3 and as a <b>tank</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Approximately 2,500 were produced between 1938 and 1945.|$|E

500|$|Lima Locomotive started {{production}} of the vehicles in June 1943, with five M32B2s and 46 M32B3s. Pressed Steel Car produced 163 M32s and 475 M32B1s in 1944. They also produced 298 M32B3s. Baldwin Locomotive produced 195 M32B1s, while 398 M32B1s were produced by Federal Machine {{before the end of}} 1944. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, used to pull heavy artillery. The M32s were used after 1944 during Operation Overlord and subsequent battles in the European Theater of Operations. It was also used during the Korean War. It was phased out after the introduction of the M74 <b>Tank</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicle</b> in 1954, when heavier tanks were produced, such as the M46 Patton. The M32 had a [...] winch, [...] boom, and an A-frame jib. It was armed with two machine guns and a mortar mainly to provide cover for an emergency retreat.|$|E

The engines varied depending on the variant of the M4 Sherman the vehicle was based on because M32s were based on the M4 Sherman. The range and fuel capacity varied between [...] and [...] respectively depending on the engine. However, top speed remained constant at [...]|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, 2003, a large {{statue of}} Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square, {{directly}} in front of the Palestine Hotel where the world's journalists had been quartered, was toppled by a U.S. M88 <b>tank</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle</b> surrounded by dozens of celebrating Iraqis, who had been attempting to pull down the statue earlier with little success. One such futile attempt by sledgehammer wielding weightlifter Kadhem Sharif particularly caught media attention. [...] Eventually the M88 was able to topple the statue which was jumped upon by Iraqi citizens who then decapitated the head of the statue and dragged it through the streets of the city hitting it with their shoes. The destruction of the statue was shown live on cable news networks as it happened and made the front pages of newspapers and covers of magazines all over the world - symbolizing the fall of the Saddam government. The images of the statue falling came as a shock to many Arab viewers, who had thought that Iraq was winning the war.|$|E
