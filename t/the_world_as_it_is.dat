25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E

The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her or his child, able to offer only a feeble apology as Dot departs sadly.|$|E
25|$|While {{recording}} Henry Cow's last album, differences emerged {{between the}} group members over the album's content. Frith and Chris Cutler favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, {{to release the}} songs already created on their own album, Hopes and Fears, under the name Art Bears (with Dagmar Krause). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on Western Culture later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, Winter Songs in 1979 and <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> Today in 1981.|$|E

25|$|Finnish mythology {{and more}} {{specifically}} the Finnish national epic Kalevala were also acknowledged by Tolkien as an influence on Middle-earth. In {{a manner similar to}} The Lord of the Rings, the Kalevala centres around a magical item of great power, the Sampo, which bestows great fortune on its owner, but never makes clear its exact nature. Like the One Ring, the Sampo is fought over by forces of good and evil, and is ultimately lost to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> destroyed {{towards the end of the}} story. In another parallel, the work's wizard character, Väinämöinen, is similar to Gandalf in his immortal origins and wise nature, and both works end with the wizard character departing on a ship to lands beyond the mortal world. Tolkien also based elements of his Elvish language Quenya on Finnish.|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} Ricky as its [...] "visionary, {{spiritual and}} mystical center". He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States. [...] The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.|$|E
2500|$|Immanuel Kant ( [...] ; 22 April 1724– 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is {{a central}} figure in modern philosophy. Kant argued that the human mind creates the {{structure}} of human experience, that reason {{is the source of}} morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "in-itself" [...] is independent of man's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a [...] "Copernican revolution" [...] in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolved around the earth.

In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us.

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{of the era}} argue that a single name overshadows all others in 18th-century prose satire: Jonathan Swift. [...] Swift wrote poetry as well as prose, and his satires range over all topics. [...] Critically, Swift's satire marked the development of prose parody away from simple satire or burlesque. [...] A burlesque or lampoon in prose would imitate a despised author and quickly move to reductio ad absurdum by having the victim say things coarse or idiotic. [...] On the other hand, other satires would argue against a habit, practice, or policy by making fun of its reach or composition or methods. [...] What Swift did was to combine parody, with its imitation of form and style of another, and satire in prose. [...] Swift's works would pretend to speak {{in the voice of}} an opponent and imitate the style of the opponent and have the parodic work itself be the satire. [...] Swift's first major satire was A Tale of a Tub (17031705), which introduced an ancients/moderns division that would serve as a distinction between the old and new conception of value. [...] The [...] "moderns" [...] sought trade, empirical science, the individual's reason above the society's, while the [...] "ancients" [...] believed in inherent and immanent value of birth, and the society over the individual's determinations of the good. [...] In Swift's satire, the moderns come out looking insane and proud of their insanity, and dismissive of the value of history. In Swift's most significant satire, Gulliver's Travels (1726), autobiography, allegory, and philosophy mix together in the travels. Thematically, Gulliver's Travels is a critique of human vanity, of pride. [...] Book one, the journey to Liliput, begins with <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> [...] Book two shows that the idealized nation of Brobdingnag with a philosopher king is no home for a contemporary Englishman. [...] Book four depicts the land of the Houyhnhnms, a society of horses ruled by pure reason, where humanity itself is portrayed as a group of [...] "yahoos" [...] covered in filth and dominated by base desires. It shows that, indeed, the very desire for reason may be undesirable, and humans must struggle to be neither Yahoos nor Houyhnhnms, for book three shows what happens when reason is unleashed without any consideration of morality or utility (i.e. madness, ruin, and starvation).|$|E
