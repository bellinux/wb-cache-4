5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, filling of trap states, [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>parameters</b> exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E

Centrifuged and noncentrifuged cell samples suspended in either deionised water (pH 7) or acidified water (pH 1. 5) were tested for imaging. Mica and glass cover slips were used as potential substrates for attachment. Cells were attached to substrates for imaging by simple adsorption (‘air-drying’ method). To optimise <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>parameters,</b> the effect of different values of the scan rate, deflection setpoint and the feedback gains on the quality of AFM imaging was investigated.

Method: A Catphan phantom {{was used to assess}} how image quality on a Toshiba Aquilion LB scanner changed with <b>scan</b> <b>parameters.</b> Acquisition and reconstruction field-of-view (FOV), collimation, image slice thickness, effective mAs per rotation and reconstruction algorithm were varied. Changes were assessed for HUs of different materials, high contrast spatial resolution (HCSR), contrast-noise ratio (CNR), HU uniformity, scan direction low contrast and CT dose-index. Results: CNR and HCSR varied most with reconstruction algorithm, reconstruction FOV and effective mAs. Collimation, but not image slice width, had a significant effect on CT dose-index with narrower collimation giving higher doses. Dose increased with effective mAs. Highest HU differences were seen when changing reconstruction algorithm: 56 HU for densities close to water and 117 HU for bone-like materials. Acquisition FOV affected the HUs but reconstruction FOV and effective mAs did not. Conclusions: All <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> <b>parameters</b> investigated affected <b>the</b> image quality metrics.
