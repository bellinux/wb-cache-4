50|$|Bodenstein also {{investigated}} in photochemistry, being first to demonstrate that, in {{the reaction of}} hydrogen with chlorine, the high performance could explain {{by means of a}} chain reaction. He explored in great detail the reaction mechanism of reaction between hydrogen and chlorine. With this research, he contributed to the understanding in light-induced chemical chain reactions and thus contributed to <b>the</b> <b>photochemistry.</b> In his kinetic studies, he used the quasi-steady state approximation to derive the rate equation of the reaction. When an overall reaction is subdivided into elementary steps, Bodenstein's quasi-steady state approximation neglects the variations in the concentrations of reaction intermediates by assuming that these will remain quasi-constant. These reactive intermediates can be radicals, carbenium ions, molecules in the excited state, etc.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) are abundant {{enough to have a}} significant impact upon <b>the</b> ambient <b>photochemistry.</b> <b>The</b> vertical distribution of C 2 H 6, C 2 H 2, C 3 H 8, C 4 H 10, and C 5 H 12 in the altitude range from 0 to 40 km was calculated in this connection. A one-dimensional steady state model with coupled photochemistry and vertical transport was employed in the investigation. The calculations imply that measurable quantities of relatively unreactive NMHC, especially C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 2, may be present in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The results indicate, however, that NMHC are not likely to have a large impact on <b>the</b> background <b>photochemistry</b> of <b>the</b> troposphere, although local effects near source regions are probable. The findings support the current practice of many modelers who neglect NMHC in their calculations...|$|R

5000|$|Robert Emerson {{discovered}} two light reactions {{by testing}} plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When {{blue and red}} were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll [...] "a", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll [...] "a" [...] {{with most of the}} available chlorophyll [...] "b", among other pigment. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers <b>the</b> <b>photochemistry.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Such IR {{observations}} {{have determined}} that in dense clouds (where there are enough particles to attenuate the destructive UV radiation) thin ice layers coat the microscopic particles, permitting some low-temperature chemistry to occur. Since hydrogen {{is by far the}} most abundant molecule in the universe, the initial chemistry of these ices is determined by the chemistry of the hydrogen. If the hydrogen is atomic, then the H atoms react with available O, C and N atoms, producing [...] "reduced" [...] species like H2O, CH4, and NH3. However, if the hydrogen is molecular and thus not reactive, this permits the heavier atoms to react or remain bonded together, producing CO, CO2, CN, etc. These mixed-molecular ices are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays, which results in complex radiation-driven chemistry. Lab experiments on <b>the</b> <b>photochemistry</b> of simple interstellar ices have produced amino acids. The similarity between interstellar and cometary ices (as well as comparisons of gas phase compounds) have been invoked as indicators of a connection between interstellar and cometary chemistry. This is somewhat supported by the results of the analysis of the organics from the comet samples returned by the Stardust mission but the minerals also indicated a surprising contribution from high-temperature chemistry in the solar nebula.|$|E
