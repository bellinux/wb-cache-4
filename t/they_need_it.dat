5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> <b>It</b> is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) is Joel's brother. At {{the initial}} outbreak, he picked Joel and Sarah {{up in his}} car {{to take them to}} safety. When the car is hit by a truck, he defends Joel as he carries Sarah, whose leg is badly hurt. After Sarah's death, Joel and Tommy {{initially}} survive together, but differing outlooks and Joel's hardened ways led to their estrangement, and Tommy left to join the Fireflies. After becoming disillusioned, he subsequently left them as well, and built a settlement around a working power plant in Wyoming with his wife, Maria. Many years later, Joel arrives at Tommy's settlement, and the brothers are reunited. Tommy initially refuses to take Ellie off Joel's hands, but upon seeing their close bond and realizing that Joel doesn't trust himself to protect Ellie, he agrees to take her to Marlene himself. However, Ellie confronts Joel about Sarah and, after having a change of heart, Joel and Ellie continue their journey after Tommy promises them sanctuary should <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Teleconferencing and {{telepresence}} {{technologies are}} often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins {{as a result of}} lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc. The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed. Other related initiatives, such as Hoteling, reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} poorer {{access to}} health care {{resources}} than men. In certain regions of Africa, many women often lack access to malaria treatment as well as access to resources that could protect them against Anopheles mosquitoes during pregnancy. As a result of this, pregnant women who are residing in areas with low levels of malaria transmission are still placed at two to three times higher risk than men in terms of contracting a severe malaria infection. These disparities in access to healthcare are often compounded by cultural norms and expectations imposed on women. For example, certain societies forbid women from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a male relative, making it harder for women to receive healthcare services and resources when <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> most.|$|E

25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump as <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids. An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and straight, with the hindgut being longer and coiled. Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. In insects, the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle, however species that have a different diet require adaptations to meet these new demands.|$|E

His financial situation was very likely desperate, as extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so, according to experts, because <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk.

[...] Midden closets were still used {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century but were rapidly falling out of favour. [...] A Mr Redgrave, in a speech to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1876, said that the midden closet represented [...] "... the standard of all that is utterly wrong, constructed as it is of porous materials, and permitting free soakage of filth into the surrounding soil, capable of containing the entire dejections from a house, or from a block of houses, for months and even years". [...] The 1868 Rivers Pollution Commission reported two years later: [...] "privies and ashpits are continually to be seen full to overflowing and as filthy as can be...These middens are cleaned out whenever notice is given that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> probably once half-yearly on an average, by a staff of night-men with their attendant carts." ...|$|E

[...] Thus, the creation of the JCET. [...] It allows SOF to train foreign troops not so much because <b>THEY</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> but because it is a training event that allows the SF folks to maintain instructional skills, develop training aids, hone best instructor practices, language skills, etc., in preparation for combat employment in a FID or UW environment. [...] In order to be a JCET - contrary to the reference - the US Forces must receive over 50% of the benefit.|$|E
60|$|For consider--Man {{was first}} put upon this earth, with all things round him new and strange to him; seeing himself weak and unarmed before the wild beasts of the forest, not even {{sheltered}} from the cold, as they are; and yet feeling in himself {{a power of}} mind, a cunning, a courage, which made him the lord of all the beasts {{by virtue of his}} MIND, though they were stronger than he in body. All that we read of Adam and Eve in the Bible is, as we should expect, the history of CHILDREN--children in mind, even when they were full- grown in stature. Innocent as children, but, like children, greedy, fanciful, ready to disobey at the first temptation, for the very silliest of reasons; and disobeying accordingly. Such creatures-- with such wonderful powers lying hid in them, such a glorious future before them; and yet so weak, so wilful, so ignorant, so unable to take care of themselves, liable to be destroyed {{off the face of the}} earth by their own folly, or even by the wild beasts around--surely <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> some special and tender care from God to keep them from perishing at the very outset, till they had learned somewhat how to take care of themselves, what their business and duty were upon this earth. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> before <b>they</b> fell; <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> still more, and their children likewise, after they fell: and if <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it,</b> we may trust God that he afforded it to them.|$|R

[...] Studies have found that social barriers to continuing breastfeeding are insufficiently recognized and addressed by healthcare professionals. [...] Studies suggest that one of the greatest barriers to improving breastfeeding rates among adolescent mothers are the expectations made by health care providers who assume young mother are too immature to breastfeed successfully. [...] Therefore, these young mothers receive even less education and support than adult mothers even though <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> most. Participants of the various studies reported that medical staff directed them towards the hospital's vast supply of formula milk instead of receiving lactation consultations even when they wished to breastfeed.|$|E
2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it?</b> Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|The Princess {{began her}} work with AIDS victims in the 1980s. In 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London. She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys." [...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK. As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992. She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and I suppose {{there are not many}} of this sort of fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I heard that one had been caught or found dead; {{and it seems to me}} as though there must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for I believe that they are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> <b>It</b> is said to be the nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E
