40|$|The Rod and Frame test {{measures}} an individual’s subjective {{assessment of}} visual {{vertical and horizontal}} {{in the presence of}} a surrounding <b>tilted</b> <b>frame.</b> Attention has focused upon the effects of the surrounding frame upon spatial accuracy (Spatial Frame Effect). We have investigated if the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> also affects the time that subjects take to make the alignment (Temporal Frame Effect). Results: 125 subjects performed a computerised Rod and Frame test to investigate the effects of a <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> on subjective visual vertical and horizontal. In addition the program recorded the time taken to make each alignment. For most subjects the mean Spatial Frame Effect was small (vertical 1. 62, SD 0. 93; horizontal 1. 9, SD 1. 43). The mean time taken to make alignments {{in the presence of a}} <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> was longer than when the <b>frame</b> was not <b>tilted</b> (vertical, + 3. 4 s, SD 4. 4; horizontal, + 3. 2 s, SD 4. 5). Differences in the times taken when the rod and frame were presented congruently and incongruently could be fully accounted for by the differences in steps needed to move the rod to its final alignment. No relationship was found between the spatial accuracy and the time to make the alignment and there was no relationship between the Spatial and Temporal Frame Effects. Conclusions: This study suggests that the Spatial, and Temporal, Frame Effects provide information about different aspects of the process of resolving conflicting visual information when making judgments on alignment. In everyday functions such as the maintenance of balance or susceptibility to motion sickness, the increased time taken may be as important as spatial accuracy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the possible links between perceptive visual field dependence-independence and the visual contribution to postural control. In our differential approach, visual field dependent (FD) and independent (FI) subjects were {{selected on the basis of}} their score in the Rod and Frame Test (subjective vertical). The hypothesis that we have tested is that the FD subjects use mainly visual cues for estimating not only their subjective vertical but also their body orientation and stability. Moreover, we have postulated that these subjects use mainly dynamic visual cues to control their postural stability. In the postural test, the selected subjects were instructed to stand in the sharpened Romberg position in darkness and under normal or stroboscopic illumination, in front of either a vertical or a <b>tilted</b> <b>frame.</b> Lateral head and body orientation and stability were measured. We found that: (1) all subjects leaned slightly towards the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> (postural frame effect), and this was obtained on the basis of the static visual cues alone; (2) FD subjects were less stable than FI subjects, and their stability required the use of dynamic visual cues, mainly extracted from the vertical frame. In FI subjects, static visual cues may act as a complementary regulation, enhancing stability even with a strobe <b>tilted</b> <b>frame.</b> We thus demonstrate that visual field dependence interacts with the visual contribution to postural control...|$|R

40|$|The rod-and-frame {{illusion}} shows large {{errors in}} the judgment of visual vertical in the dark if the frame is large {{and there are no}} other visible cues (Witkin and Asch, 1948 Journal of Experimental Psychology 38 762 - 782). Three experiments were performed to investigate other characteristics of the frame critical for generating these large errors. In the first experiment, the illusion produced by an 11 degrees <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> made by luminance borders (standard condition) was considerably larger than that produced by a subjective-contour frame. In the second experiment, with a 33 degrees <b>frame</b> <b>tilt,</b> the illusion was in the direction of <b>frame</b> <b>tilt</b> with a luminance-border frame but in the opposite direction in the subjective-contour condition. In the third experiment, to contrast the role of local and global orientation, the sides of the frame were made of short separate luminous segments. The segments could be oriented {{in the same direction as}} the frame sides, in the opposite direction, or could be vertical. The orientation of the global frame dominated the illusion while local orientation produced much smaller effects. Overall, to generate a large rod-and-frame illusion in the dark, the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> must have luminance, not subjective, contours. Luminance borders do not need to be continuous: a frame made of sparse segments is also effective. The mechanism responsible for the large orientation illusion is driven by integrators of orientation across large areas, not by figural operators extracting shape orientation in the absence of oriented contours...|$|R

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{proposed as}} alternatives by Rock [...] {{frame of reference}} and hierarchical organisation of perception [...] were tested {{in a series of}} experiments {{with the use of the}} rod-and-frame illusion. This illusion produces errors in the apparent vertical due to the presence of a <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> surrounding the test rod. The apparent vertical is shifted in the direction of the <b>frame</b> <b>tilt.</b> When an upright square was added inside the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame,</b> rod-setting errors varied according to the visual characteristics of the display. In the case of a large display presented in the dark (experiment 1), there continued to be large errors in the direction of the outer-square tilt. This finding supports the frame-of-reference hypothesis, which proposes that the orientation of all objects in the visual field is dominated by the most peripheral reference. In the case of a small display presented in a lit environment (experiments 2 and 3), the direction of errors was the opposite. This latter finding was taken to indicate that the rod was set with reference to the perceived tilt of the inner upright square. Thus, according to a hierarchical - organisation hypothesis, the orientation of an object in the visual field is influenced by objects in the immediate surroundings not by outermost reference. Overall, the results confirm the presence of two qualitatively different classes of orientational phenomena: one is concerned with the definition of egocentric coordinates and one with an object-centred visual representation...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{patients}} with balance disorders report a `visual vertigo' {{in which their}} symptoms are provoked or aggravated by specific visual contexts (e. g. supermarkets, driving or movement of objects). In {{order to determine the}} causes of visual vertigo (VV), we assessed symptoms, anxiety and the influence of disorienting visual stimuli in 21 such patients. In 17 out of 21 patients, a peripheral vestibular disorder was diagnosed. Sixteen bilateral labyrinthine-defective subjects (LDS) and 25 normal subjects served as controls. Questionnaire assessment showed that the levels of trait anxiety and childhood motion sickness in the three subject groups were not significantly different. Reporting of autonomic symptoms and somatic anxiety was higher than normal in both patient groups but not significantly different between LDS and VV patients. Handicap levels were not different in the two patient groups, but the reporting of vestibular symptoms was higher in the VV than in the LDS group. The experimental stimuli required subjects to set the subjective visual vertical in three visual conditions: total darkness, in front of a <b>tilted</b> luminous <b>frame</b> (rod and frame test) and in front of a large disc rotating in the frontal plane (rod and disc test). Body sway was also measured in four visual conditions: eyes closed, eyes open, facing the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> and during disc rotation. In psychophysical and postural tests, both LDS and VV patients showed: (i) {{a significant increase in the}} tilt of the visual vertical both with the static <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> and with the rotating disc; and (ii) an increased postural deviation whilst facing the <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> and the rotating disc. The ratio between sway path with eyes closed and eyes open (i. e. the stabilizing effect of vision) was increased in the LDS, but not in VV patients, compared with normal subjects. In contrast, the ratio between sway path during disc rotation and sway path during eyes open (i. e. the destabilizing effect of a moving visual stimulus) was increased in the VV patients but not in LDS. Taken together, these data show that VV patients have abnormally large perceptual and postural responses to disorienting visual environments. VV is not related to trait anxiety or a past history of motion sickness. The results indicate that VV emerges in vestibular patients if they have increased visual dependence and difficulty in resolving conflict between visual and vestibulo-proprioceptive inputs. It is argued that treating these {{patients with}} visual motion desensitization, e. g. repeated optokinetic stimulation, should be beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} theory {{that there is a}} tendency to interpret the axes of a large <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> of reference as surrogates of the main axes of the environment. Therefore {{there is a tendency to}} perceive such a frame as either upright or as less tilted than it is—righting—and, accordingly, to perceive a vertical rod as tilted in the opposite direction—the rod-and-frame effect (RFE). A high correlation was found between righting and the RFE in all experiments. When a double frame apparatus was used, with the outer frame upright and the inner <b>frame</b> <b>tilted,</b> there was no consistent RFE. This condition eliminates any righting effect. When the outer <b>frame</b> was <b>tilted</b> and the inner one was upright, however, the RFE was induced, as was a correlated righting effect. All experiments were repeated with the subject's head tilted, thereby increasing the tendency toward righting of the frame. The result was a corresponding increase in the RFE. The RFE can thus be thought of as the solution to the problem of the rod's tilt given the perceived <b>tilt</b> of the <b>frame.</b> In the classic rod-and-frame effect (RFE...|$|R

40|$|Patients with spatial {{hemi-neglect}} display systematic {{deviations of}} the subjective vertical. The magnitude of such deviations {{was shown to}} be modulated by internal factors mediating the perception of verticality, including head-orientation. The present study investigated whether and how spatial orientation deficits are modulated by external, contextual changes in neglect patients. In a classic rod-and-frame task, we analyzed effects of frame orientation on the subjective visual vertical (SVV) in neglect patients, control patients with left- or right-sided brain damage without neglect and healthy participants. We found that neglect patients, but not brain-damaged control patients, generally display a systematic counterclockwise (CCW) tilt in their SVV judgments. Furthermore, all participant groups displayed a typical rod-and-frame effect (RFE), that is, a modulation of the SVV {{as a function of}} <b>frame</b> <b>tilt.</b> However, in the control groups, this modulation was only moderate whereas in the neglect group SVV judgments were substantially and systematically modulated by frame orientation: with CCW <b>frame</b> <b>tilts,</b> the spatial bias of neglect patients increased {{as a function of the}} magnitude of the tilt whereas with clockwise (CW) <b>frame</b> <b>tilts,</b> the spatial bias was decreased in case of moderate <b>frame</b> <b>tilts</b> and even reversed in case of stronger <b>frame</b> <b>tilts,</b> resulting in a substantial CW spatial bias. This dramatically enhanced RFE might be caused by a pathologically increased influence of contextual cues on the subjective vertical in neglect patients as a consequence of impaired processing of gravitational information. The results indicate a systematic bias of the subjective vertical along with an impairment of spatial orientation constancy which leads to severe perturbations of subjective space as well as an increased reliance on internal and external cues mediating the perception of verticality in neglect...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of an additional external upright frame was studied in three experiments to separate the role of visuovestibular, global, and local mechanisms in the rod-and-frame illusion (RFI). In the first experiment, carried out in a dark room, the external frame surrounded a large <b>tilted</b> <b>frame.</b> Rod-setting errors to the vertical were abolished with the additional-frame condition (at 22 degrees inner-frame tilt) confirming earlier findings. However, small, residual direct (at 11 degrees inner-frame tilt) and indirect effects (at 33 degrees inner-frame tilt) were still present, indicating the persistence of global visual processing. In the second experiment, the RFI in the dark was compared with the RFI with the lights on. Turning the light on abolished the effect at 22 degrees and 33 degrees frame tilt; however, a small direct effect was maintained at 11 degrees <b>frame</b> <b>tilt.</b> These two studies indicate that the addition of veridical vertical information abolishes the effect owing to visuovestibular mechanisms. In the third experiment, a small rod and frame was used with the lights on (a condition abolishing visual-vestibular interaction). In {{the case of a}} small gap between the rod and the inducing frame (a condition which maximises local processing), the effect of the outer upright frame was negligible; this indicates that the additional frame had no effect on local processing.

40|$|International audienceHead-mounted {{displays}} are now extensively {{developed and}} tested {{to be used}} in enhanced reality environments. The technique consists in transmitting synthetic visual information to the user's eyes {{in such a way that}} virtual objects are superimposed on the real world. Some displays give the feeling of viewing a rectangular head-fixed virtual screen with clearly visible contours. In addition, head-mounted displays allow for the presentation of head-fixed visual information to the user and this may be an advantage in some applications, military aeronautics for instance. Presenting head-fixed visual information may not be trivial with regard to actual models of spatial orientation. This study addressed the question of potential disorienting effects associated with head-mounted displays by investigating the influence of a head-fixed visual frame on the perception of the vertical when the head or the whole body was tilted in the frontal plane. In a first experiment, subjects were instructed to indicate the vertical by rotating a visual rod that appeared at the centre of the <b>frame</b> whilst <b>tilting</b> the head in various positions. This performance was compared with the effect on the subjective vertical of a <b>tilted</b> earth-based visual <b>frame</b> without head <b>tilts</b> as well as with the effect of tilting the head without a <b>frame.</b> With the <b>tilted</b> <b>frames,</b> subjects set the rod in an intermediate direction between the gravitational vertical and the orientation of the frame. Errors were substantially larger with a head-fixed visual <b>frame</b> during head <b>tilt</b> than with a <b>tilted</b> earth-based <b>frame.</b> This difference cannot be attributed to the addition of a postural effect caused by the head being tilted Moreover, continuous vision of the frame when its orientation changed improved performance only when the head and the frame were dissociated, i. e. with an earth-based frame. A second experiment investigated the effects of a head-fixed frame on the subjective vertical and on the voluntary control of head orientation when the whole body was tilted. The effect of a head-fixed frame was contrasted with the effect of a trunk-fixed frame. Results show that the head-fixed frame modified the head behaviour when subjects were instructed to align the head with the trunk. These errors contributed to an increase in the visual frame influence on the subjective vertical. Results of both experiments suggest that integrating visual information in the head-centric reference frame is crucial for spatial orientation.

No difference was found between the errors of the CNP and control groups {{in the absence of a}} surrounding <b>frame.</b> When a <b>tilted</b> <b>frame</b> was added to the CRAF test, the range of errors observed in the CNP group increased for both SVV and SVH. In particular, significantly more CNP patients fell outside the reference range of errors and a subgroup of patients, characterised by higher neck pain disability indices, was identified who demonstrated higher than expected errors for both SVV and SVH. However no conclusion could be drawn with regards to the direction of error asymmetry and laterality of pain as those patients with unilateral pain exhibited errors both towards and away from the affected area...|$|R
