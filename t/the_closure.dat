5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995.

5|$|The branch was {{included}} in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that, since 30% of the railway network carried less than 1% of the total passenger traffic, much of it should be closed. The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted <b>the</b> <b>closure,</b> demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964. Despite many objections, it was determined that the line would close. The last passenger service was the 5:34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964, just under a century after the line opened to passengers. The mourning of the line was so great that a bucket of water was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching, the man commonly associated with <b>the</b> <b>closure</b> of over 4,000 miles of the British railway network. The crowd cheered as this happened, a mark of the public's feelings about <b>the</b> <b>closure.</b>|$|E
