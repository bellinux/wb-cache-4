25|$|I am {{sometimes}} {{inclined to}} think that in some parts - not all - of the Commonwealth, the old-fashioned traditional, and almost instinctive, standard of fair play to {{be observed by the}} Crown in dealing with subjects, which I learned a very long time ago to regard as elementary, is either not known or thought out of date. I should be glad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> mistaken.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters couple their rough-edged {{music with}} themed lyrics, which define the band {{as much as}} the costumes. The straight-forward but quirky {{presentation}} of adolescent concerns and direness in the simplest of worries gives the songs their easy likeability. They poke fun at awkward situations from the books. For example, in the song [...] "The Human Hosepipe", they sing, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't have brought up Cedric Diggory/ Because I'd rather not talk about your dead ex-boyfriends over coffee." [...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?" [...] and the song [...] "The Godfather." [...] where the gothic or mock-morbid line [...] "Why do I always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to die?" [...] is sung to an up-beat tune.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>be</b> honest too,--at {{any rate}} to you? It does fret me. I {{do not like}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> without work." ...|$|R

500|$|He {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as a privilege to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E

"there is {{a classy}} {{way to do}} {{everything}} {{and there is nothing}} wrong with being sexy or having sex appeal and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> definitely going to be someone who is boldly going to go out to the masses and be someone who say, 'Look! Women its okay'..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my love, no," [...] {{answered}} her father, kissing her. [...] "Why should you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dead? Didn't your mother tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> safe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Rivers? That flimsy, feather-headed, empty-hearted--eyes-maker! That frivolous, ridiculous--Pah! And did you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{talking of}} her? Did you think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in love with}} her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What fun!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do {{send for}} him! He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> staying with Miss Pengarth, and I haven't written once since I got here!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{conversation}} that he had with an American rabbi in the 1980s, Shach stated, [...] "The Americans <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too controversial and divisive. But {{in a time when}} no one else is willing to speak up on behalf of our true tradition, I feel myself impelled to do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have {{convinced}} myself {{that there is}} nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. [...] But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement [...] "I am, I exist" [...] must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it. [...] (Descartes, Meditation II: [...] On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).|$|E
2500|$|After British forces {{successfully}} recaptured the Falklands, Powell asked Thatcher in the Commons on 17 June, recalling {{his statement}} to her of 3 April: [...] "Is the right hon. Lady {{aware that the}} report has now been received from the public analyst on a certain substance recently subjected to analysis and that I have obtained {{a copy of the}} report? It shows that the substance under test consisted of ferrous matter of the highest quality, that it is of exceptional tensile strength, is highly resistant to wear and tear and to stress, and may be used with advantage for all national purposes?" [...] She replied, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very grateful indeed to the right hon. Gentleman. I agree with every word that he said". Their mutual friend Ian Gow printed and framed this and the original question and presented it to Thatcher, who hung it in her office.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} down into Norfolk," [...] he said. [...] "I {{had not the}} least idea of seeing you. <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever so surprised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{understand}} what you say. Let me wet your lips again with this brandy. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> away to fetch it. Did you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> long gone?' ...|$|R

2500|$|Trần Thủ Độ {{was also}} an honest {{mandarin}} who never profited his high position {{for the benefit of}} his family. It was said that one time the Emperor wanted to appointed Trần Thủ Độ's elder brother Trần An Quốc for the position of grand chancellor. Trần Thủ Độ politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: [...] "An Quốc is my brother, if he is better than me then I had better retire from the position, but if Your Majesty <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?". For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Trần Thủ Độ in his tomb. However, Trần Thủ Độ still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of Lý royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Trần Thái Tông and his brother Trần Liễu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a child?" [...] {{she asked}} scornfully. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{to be put}} off with such rubbish as that? I made all my {{arrangements}} long ago for when I found you. In {{less than an hour}} you will be in prison." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, we must. I couldn't bear to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{keeping it}} from him. I don't think I've ever kept {{anything}} {{from him in}} my life. Nothing bad, I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not frightened," [...] Cecil answered. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever a coward. All the same, {{there are}} some things about this fellow which I don't quite understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{called upon}} to put right some wrong that you think was done you by Sir John's brother. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> under any such obligation. Uncle Jonathan left his money to his sister's {{children}} instead of to his brother's children. If his money had come to John, {{you would not have}} admitted that we had any claim, because we were nephews and nieces." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{stopped her}} there. [...] "She is your mother," [...] he interposed, kindly. [...] "Don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ungrateful enough to forget that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{should have}} stood aloof,--in despair to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{separating}} you from {{those with whom}} your Grace is bound up so closely. We have ever been dear friends since that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go in}} my slippers, mother, but I {{will run}} up and change my other things. It's lucky I have got a spare suit here. Any of our fellows who {{happened}} to be going down to-night in the train would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad, <b>were</b> <b>I</b> to go like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s a secret," [...] said Brisket. [...] "I don’t {{want them}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> spying. <b>I</b> told you because you understand. A {{shipmaster}} has to keep his eyes open, for everybody’s sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is nonsense. It is his own, and {{he knows}} it. Does he <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> likely to raise any {{question}} against his right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a conspiracy," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Come, {{we must go}} {{home and}} have some luncheon. My little maidservant will <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is why," [...] he added, [...] "it {{was painful}} {{to me to}} see you stand there before those men, {{answering}} their questions,--men whose walk in life was different, of an order removed from yours, who should not even have been permitted to approach you upon bended knees. Do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> suggesting any fault to you--do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> forcing your confidence in any way. But these are the thoughts which came to me only a little time ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must make}} him believe that. Do not tell him suddenly, but {{bring it in}} by degrees. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> deceiving him. He would go back if he knew that papa were gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Fulkerson {{seemed to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the one for}} you, too," [...] said March; and he laughed. [...] "That's what makes me doubt his infallibility. But he couldn't do worse with Mr. Beaton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, say! To {{hear you}} fellows talk, you'd <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the worst boy that ever lived," [...] grumbled Tom Rover. [...] "What did I ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?" ...|$|R
