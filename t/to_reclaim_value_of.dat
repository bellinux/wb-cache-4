Richards {{claims that}} Kazantzakis, in his The Last Temptation novel, tried <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> early Christianity, such as love, brotherhood, humility, and self-renunciation. According to P. Bien, the {{psychology}} in The Last Temptation {{is based on}} the idea that every person, Jesus included, is evil by nature as well as good: violent and hateful as well as loving. A psychologically sound individual does not ignore or bury the evil within him. Instead, he channels it into the service of good.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} nature and {{significance}} of aesthetic approaches to international political theory. More specifically, it contrasts aesthetic with mimetic forms of representation. The latter, which have dominated the study of international relations, seek to represent politics as realistically and authentically as possible, aiming at capturing world politics as it really is. An aesthetic approach, by contrast, assumes that {{there is always a}} gap between a form of representation and what is represented therewith. Rather than ignoring or seeking to narrow this gap, as mimetic approaches do, aesthetic insight recognises that the inevitable difference between the represented and its representation is the very location of politics. The essay, thus, argues for the need <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> the political <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the aesthetic; not to replace social science or technological reason, but to broaden our abilities to comprehend and deal with the key dilemmas of world politics. The ensuing model of thought facilitates productive interactions across different faculties, including sensibility, imagination and reason, without any of them annihilating the unique position and insight of the other...|$|R

Selective elution of resin to, recover nickel and cobalt preferentially over impurity metals can be carried out with multistage acid stripping or single stage ammoniacal stripping.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The Linn and Benton County Gleaner {{network has}} helped the low-income {{families}} of urban and rural Oregon reclaim moral, social and cultural capital that is lost {{in the act of}} being poor in America. Rather than participating solely in government safety nets, these people reject “hand-outs” in favor of exchanging their participation for aid. By embodying the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> merit, Gleaners negotiate their low-income status in a way that allows them <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> middle-class <b>values</b> and self-worth. Through 47 personal narratives, participant observation, and a 345 participant survey, this thesis examines how low-income people experience poverty, how they present themselves as middle class, and how contradictions found between qualitative and quantitative data reveal the cultural struggle of being poor in America. This project illustrates the ways that the Gleaner network provides both food and dignity to the low-income people who depend on it...|$|R

Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than {{the same amount of}} itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank <b>reclaiming</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> its original interest-free loan.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reflects}} {{on the need for}} another approach to the concept of habitability that would allow the application of collective solutions and proposals simultaneously and transversally at all scales, from the room <b>to</b> the city, <b>reclaiming</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the collective as an alternative to the reigning individualism and atomization. In front of those practices that either linger in the unstoppable race to produce the new and its new shapes and forms or align with neoliberal currents in the production and absorption of surplus values at the cost of the creative destruction of urban spaces and territories, one must claim the urgent need of other ways of doing and making that engage decisively and uncompromisingly in the task of designing coexistence. It is paramount and indispensable to advance beyond the formal and typological, incorporating not only the already known discourses of adaptability, dissociation and other contemporary private rituals but also the critical design of common, collective, public and intermediate spaces that foster sociability and conviviality making the sharing of spaces, resources and experiences possible...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} links between {{transnational}} migration, consumption and work within a postcolonial and post-socialist world. By exploring contemporary Polish and Slovenian migration to the UK through a postcolonial lens, this article aims to provide {{an understanding of the}} post-socialist space beyond the western knowledge production. The article exposes the historical orientalization of post-socialist central and eastern Europe (CEE) and its subjects, which, throughout history, has marked its peripheral status within Europe and evoked the (self-) colonial ‘catching up’ model that constitutes CEE imagined communities as well as informs CEE migrants’ agency, and defines their diversity and their positioning in the West. In particular, the article stretches the understanding of orientalism in relation to transnational consumption and migration processes, and the neo-colonial binary division of capitalism and socialism that characterizes the postsocialist world. The article demonstrates that this binary division acts as an orientalising device that legitimizes the framing of neoliberalism as the modernizing project, and affects CEE migrants’ positioning in the UK and their strategies <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> their <b>value.</b> Ultimately the article contributes by offering a critique of neo-colonial epistemic violence that legitimizes the global expansion of neoliberalism to places and spaces previously shielded from unregulated market pressures...|$|R
40|$|The Spanish Civil War {{has left}} many testimonies: written sources, {{materials}} remains and, for the moment, while the witnesses still live, even oral reports. However, the value given to these sources {{varies depending on}} factors that often {{have little to do}} with scientific precision and much to do with political considerations. In line with the current debate about historic memory and the role of archaeology and heritage management in its construction, we deem it necessary that archaeologists, as well as historians, ask to take part. The aim of this paper is to analyze air-raid shelters that still exist in the city of Valencia <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> their heritage <b>value</b> and their importance in preserving memory. These buildings were the key to the passive defense of the city and, therefore, are indispensable to understanding the reality of the bombing against the civilian population and the intensity of the war in the rear. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrokinetic}} {{properties of}} MgO have been utilized to simultaneously filter suspended solids and remove trace amounts of dissolved heavy metals from synthetic mine water. Greater than 95 pct removal of metals from influent at neutral pH containing 1 to 6 mg/L of dissolved Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn can be routinely achieved by filtering through a granular bed of MgO at flow rates typical of rapid sand filtration (0. 3 cm/s). Filtrate concentrations of most metals {{can be maintained}} below 0. 1 mg/L for 160 bed volumes or more loading. The more mobile metals (those with larger solubility products) {{are more difficult to}} remove, and are strongly bonded to the MgO granules so that chemical stripping with chelating agent is required to clean the bed. Less mobile ions are easily removed by the filter and are effectively stripped by conventional filter backwashing. The fraction of metals recovered by chemically stripping the loaded MgO filters correlates to the zero points of charge of the metals. This process may be applicable to removal and recovery of trace amounts of heavy metals in mine drainage that is partly neutralized by liming. Also, since many of these metals are critical and strategic, the technique can be adapted not only to recycle process water from mineral and milling waste streams, but also <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> their metal <b>values...</b>|$|R
30|$|Currently, {{subsided}} areas after mining {{are generally}} reclaimed {{upon completion of}} mining over a large region {{to take advantage of}} the economies of scale and mining sequence for different longwall panels. This is termed here as traditional reclamation or TR or “end of pipe solution” where land grading, soil placement, and agricultural production are performed mostly after the land has stabilized (Hu et al. 2013; Hu and Xiao 2013 b) after mining. TR approaches may satisfy only the first reclamation goal identified above, but they would most likely not satisfy the second goal. TR approaches may not develop efficient development and utilization of the coal, farmland and water resources, and regional economic development. Over the last 10 – 15  years, researchers at CUMTB are developing alternate CMR approaches <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> subsided land as mining progresses. They are similar to concurrent mining and reclamation concepts used in surface mining but are more complex. Examples include research by Li et al. (1999) who designed a pre-reclamation plan for Liuqiao coal mine based on land damage analysis. They concluded that the best time for pre-reclamation is after skipping mining of the No. 6 coal seam and before mining the central isolated working face. Furthermore, the layout of the pre-constructed water pond must correspond with the underground mining layout. Zhao and Hu (2008) developed an “appropriate reclamation timing model” for subsiding land that incorporates planning for reclamation. Hu et al. (2013) proposed CMR concepts for longwall mining <b>to</b> <b>reclaim</b> high <b>value</b> land resources (Hu and Chen 2016), which were successfully demonstrated in the field in Anhui Province, China. In laying out mining plans, subsidence development during various stages were analyzed and pertinent factors such as vertical subsidence, post-mining slope, water area, and land use condition were considered in reclamation planning. Hu et al. (2016 b) discussed a CMR design case study that considered the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> both land and water resources. Limited CMR research to date has focused primarily on reclamation goal 1 above and there is room for additional development even there to better protect farmland and water resources. Over the last 5  years, the Institute of Land Reclamation and Ecological Restoration at the CUMTB and Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC in USA) researchers are working collaboratively. They have sought to minimize the impacts to farmland and water resources and in some cases, enhance utilization of all resources while simultaneously minimizing negative economic impacts. The goals of these development efforts are to minimize loss of and/or to enhance: (1) farmland use for agriculture during and after the entire mining process, (2) surface and ground water resources for agriculture, and economic development; and (3) revenue from utilization of all resources.|$|R
