40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prediction <b>that</b> familiarity of words in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. One type of vowel in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time is smaller than that in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R

5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the minor-league Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E

5|$|During the decade, Themistocles {{continued}} to advocate {{the expansion of}} Athenian naval power.

Themistocles seems to have realised <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that could hope {{to face up to}} the Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet.
