40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> plantar <b>heel</b> pad is a {{specialized}} fibroadipose tissue that attenuates and, in part, dissipates the impact energy associated with heel strike. Although near maximal deformation of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad {{has been shown}} during running, in vivo measurement of the deformation and structural properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad during walking remains largely unexplored. This study employed a fluoroscope, synchronized with a pressure platform, to obtain force–deformation data for <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad during walking. Methods: Dynamic lateral foot radiographs were acquired from 6 male and 10 female adults (age, 45 ± 10 yrs; height, 1. 66 ± 0. 10 m; and weight, 80. 7 ± 10. 8 kg), while walking barefoot at preferred speeds. The inferior aspect of the calcaneus was digitized and the sagittal thickness and deformation of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad relative to the support surface calculated. Simultaneous measurement of the peak force beneath <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> was used to estimate the principal structural properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad. Results: Transient loading profiles associated with walking induced rapidly changing deformation rates in <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad and resulted in irregular load–deformation curves. The initial stiffness (32 ± 11 N. mm- 1) of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad was {{an order of magnitude}} lower than its final stiffness (212 ± 125 N. mm- 1) and on average, only 1. 0 J of energy was dissipated by <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad with each step during walking.

40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>heel</b> pad {{is subject}} to {{repetitive}} loading and {{plays an important role}} in absorbing shocks which may cause injuries. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> pad has a composite biological structure consisting of the fat pad and the skin. The fat pad tissue is organised into a superficial micro-chamber layer and a deep macro-chamber layer. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers have different structures and properties. Hence, to understand the contribution of each layer to <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> problem, it is essential to develop a model with discrete structure. Currently, only plantar pressure measurements are used for diagnosis and treatment of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> problems, whereas it has been shown that high internal tissue stress is an important factor. Because of complex geometry, discrete structure and nonlinear material behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad, <b>the</b> external force applied to <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> may result in inhomogeneous internal stress condition. Therefore, the relationship between the plantar pressure and internal stress does not seem to be simple. Since there is no equipment to allow measurement of internal stress, a detailed multi-layered FE model of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad can be used as a solution to predict the internal stress. The main objective of this work was to obtain the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties of <b>the</b> subject-specific <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers in-vivo. For this purpose, a combined methodology of finite element modeling and experimentation was developed. An anatomically detailed 3 D FE model of <b>the</b> human <b>heel</b> area was developed using MR images of the right foot of a female subject. A combined ultrasound and indentation system was used to apply series of slow and rapid compression tests on the same foot. The forcestrain responses of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad and its sub-layers were used as input to the FE model to estimate properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers using inverse FEA. The hyperelastic and viscoelastic FE models were then implemented to investigate the effects of experimental and geometrical factors on <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad responses. <b>The</b> model was also used to assess the robustness of the hyperelastic FE model when predicting the behaviour of other heels with different geometries. Finally, this model was used with Taguchi method to evaluate the effect of footwear design factors on the compressive stress in <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad tissue. There were some key limitations in this study. For example, the properties of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> pad sub-layers were estimated only for a specific heel pad. Also, whilst it is preferred to use xviii automatic segmentation and solid modeling to improve repeatability of some FE processes, some parts of the modeling process were performed manually...|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>heel</b> is <b>the</b> bottom {{rear part}} of a shoe. Its {{function}} is to support <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of <b>the</b> foot.

50|$|With {{a running}} gait, the foot-loading order {{is usually the}} reverse of walking.

50|$|The {{compressive}} forces {{applied to the}} foot are distributed along five rays, three medial (side of big toe) and two lateral (side of little toe). The lateral rays stretch over the cuboid bone to <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> bone and <b>the</b> medial rays over the three cuneiform bones and the navicular bone to the ankle bone. Because the ankle bone is placed over <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> bone, these rays are adjacent near the toes but overriding near <b>the</b> <b>heel,</b> and together they form the arches of the foot that are optimized to distributed {{compressive forces}} across an uneven terrain. In this context <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> thus forms <b>the</b> posterior point of support that together with the balls of the large and little toes {{bear the brunt of}} the loads.|$|R

This causes the uppermost portion of the back of <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> bone to rub against the tendon. Eventually, due to this constant irritation, a bony protrusion develops and the bursa becomes inflamed. It is the inflamed bursa that produces the redness and swelling associated with Haglund's deformity.|$|R
