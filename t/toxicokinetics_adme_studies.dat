In reaching this goal, nonclinical kinetics and metabolism studies form the pier for the bridge between toxi-cokinetics and toxicity studies; the combination of ADME data with human pharma-cokinetics is essential for a drug-exposure based safety evaluation. Lists of <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> to be performed in the various stages of drug development are presented and discussed; they comprise standard in-vivo and in-vitro studies as well as some op-tional <b>studies.</b> <b>ADME</b> <b>studies,</b> however, should always be tailor-made, that is, de-signed on a case-by-case basis; in line with a global strategy; and anticipating toxico-logical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic findings by a flexible step-by-step approach.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} recognition within the pharmaceutical industry {{of the importance of}} the <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> in drug registration. Consequently, there has been a drive in recent times to conduct the <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> as early as possible in the development programme. There are, however, regulatory barriers, particularly in the administration of radiotracers to human volunteers, which place limitations on the timing of the <b>ADME</b> <b>studies.</b> Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), a technology new to the pharmaceutical industry, is an ultrasensitive technique for measuring tracers such as 14 C. Using AMS, it is possible to lower the radioactive dose administered to humans to a point where many regulatory authorities consider it insignificant. With the removal of the regulatory hurdles, ADME data can be obtained much earlier in the development process. Tracers such as 14 C can be administered in minute amounts in the first in man studies (Phase I), or even in a preregulatory study known as microdosing (or human Phase 0). AMS also enables other studies such as absolute bioavailability to be conducted earlier if required. Â© Ashley Publications Ltd 2005...|$|R

40|$|Studies of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and {{elimination}} (ADME) {{have long}} been recognized as important {{in the evaluation of}} the pharmacological efficacy of pharmaceutical agents. In recent years, the importance of <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> in toxicology also has become increasingly apparent. In realization of the importance of <b>ADME</b> <b>studies,</b> regulatory agencies have established guidelines governing the conduct of these studies. To be of maximum utility, it is desirable that <b>ADME</b> and pharmacokinetic <b>studies</b> be closely integrated with the toxicity testing protocol. However, in many instances this is not the case, which results in <b>ADME</b> and pharmacokinetic <b>studies</b> that are often chronologically and philosophically remote from the toxicity testing protocols. An inevitable consequence of this approach is that it frequently leads to the generation of ADME data that are of limited use in the process of toxicity evaluation and risk assessment. Recently, there has been increased focus on developing testing strategies that would result in the development of ADME data with greater application to toxicity testing and risk assessment. An example of such an approach is the concept of a tiered approach to the conduct of <b>ADME</b> <b>studies.</b> An important aspect of the tiered approach is generating ADME data at an earlier stage during the toxicity testing of a chemical. This could be effected by acceptance of the concept of a minimum experimental data set for a chemical. This minimum data set could be conducted in a timely and economic manner and would develop data addressing three fundamental questions: Is the chemical absorbed? Is the chemical metabolized? Does the chemical persist? The data generated under a minimum data set scenario would not be designed to provide sufficient information for utility in risk evaluation. However, it would provide important information at a much earlier stage of toxicity testing than currently generated under existing testing strategies. Such information would be of importance in the design of toxicity testing <b>studies.</b> Additional <b>ADME</b> and pharmacokinetic information could then be conducted when a specific concern (e. g., toxicity) becomes apparent...|$|R

In total, 148 Kampo formulae are officially approved as prescription drugs and covered by the national health insurance system in Japan. However, despite their long track record of clinical use, the multi-targeted, multi-component properties of Kampo medicines, which are fundamentally different from Western medicines, have made it difficult to create a suitable framework for conducting well designed, large-scale clinical trials. In turn, this has led to misconceptions among western trained physicians concerning the paucity of scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of Kampo medicines. Fortunately, there has been a recent surge in scientifically robust data from basic and clinical studies for some of the Kampo medicines, e. g., daikenchuto (TU- 100).

ANK 1 ‐ROof 90 % or higher was achievedwith all doses in the majority of the tested brain regions at Cmax, with a long duration of RO. The netupitant minimal plasma concentration predicted to achieve a NK 1 ‐RO of 90 %, C 90 %, in the striatum was 225 ng/mL; after administration of netupitant 300 mg, concentrations exceeded the C 90 %.

As a number of the available phosphate binders do not provide the optimal combination of good efficacy, adequate tolerability and low pill burden, sucroferric oxyhydroxide constitutes a promising alternative. Among the attributes of an ideal phosphate binder is minimal absorption and, hence, low risk of systemic toxicity. Accordingly, the iron-releasing properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile of sucroferric oxyhydroxide, as well as the possibility of iron accumulation and toxicity, were investigated in a series of preclinical studies. The effect of sucroferric oxyhydroxide on the progression of vascular calcification was also investigated. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide exhibited a high phosphate-binding capacity and low iron-releasing properties across the physiological pH range found in the gastrointestinal tract. In the <b>ADME</b> <b>studies,</b> uptake of (59) Fe-radiolabelled sucroferric oxyhydroxide was low in rats and dogs (< 1 % from a 50 mg Fe/kg bodyweight dose), with the majority of absorbed iron located in red blood cells.

So for risk assessment of pesticides, toxicokinetics should be interpreted {{in the context of}} potential exposure in the field taking account of the timescale of exposure and individual patterns of feeding. Internal concentration is the net result of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). We present a case study for thiamethoxam to show how data from <b>ADME</b> <b>study</b> on rats can be used to parameterize a body burden model which predicts body residue levels after exposures to LD 50 dose either as a bolus or eaten at different feeding rates. Kinetic parameters were determined in male and female rats after an intravenous and oral administration of 14 C labelled by fitting one-compartment models to measured pesticide concentrations in blood for each individual separately. The concentration of thiamethoxam in blood over time correlated closely with concentrations in other tissues and so was considered representative of pesticide concentration in the whole body. Body burden model simulations showed that maximum body weight-normalized doses of thiamethoxam were lower if the same external dose was ingested normally than if it was force fed in a single bolus dose. This indicates lower risk to rats through dietary exposure than would be estimated from the bolus LD 50. The importance of key questions that should be answered before using the body burden approach in risk assessment, data requirements and assumptions made in this study are discussed in detail...|$|R

Results indicated that N 9 -GP-related radioactivity was distributed throughout the body, being most abundant in highly vascularised tissues, and with lowest levels seen in the central nervous system. N 9 -GP was cleared from plasma within 1 week after dosing, while total radioactivity was eliminated more slowly, in a more pronounced biphasic manner. N 9 -GP seems to be cleared via receptor-mediated uptake (e. g., in the liver) or via the reticuloendothelial system with subsequent proteolysis. PEG is thereafter either cleared alongside the protein or released back into circulation. Furthermore, N 9 -GP-related radioactivity was excreted in both faeces and urine as 40 kDa PEG and degradation products. Some PEG-related radioactivity (not in any particular organ) was present in the carcass 12 weeks postdose, consistent with the long terminal elimination t½ of plasma radioactivity. As shown here for N 9 -GP, and previously for other protein-PEG conjugate products, disposition kinetics of conjugates and individual constituents appears to be compound specific. In addition to the size/structure of the PEG and protein moieties, protein-specific clearance pathways may contribute to the disposition of intact conjugate and PEG moiety...|$|R

The generated model also passed Tropsha’s test for predictive ability and Y-Randomisation test. The Domain of Applicability (APD) of the model was also successfully defined to ascertain that a given estimation can be considered reliable. Further, the restrictivity of the model was checked with inactive compounds by enrichment studies using the decoy test.

Previously reported upregulation of hepatic Mdr 1 b P-glycoprotein in proprietary Wistar Mdr 1 a knockout rats was not observed in the SAGE counterpart investigated herein. Relative liver and kidney weights were 22 – 53 % higher in all three knockouts, with microscopic increases in hepatocyte size in Mdr 1 a and Mrp 2 knockout rats and glomerular size in Bcrp and Mrp 2 knockouts. Increased relative weight of clearing organs is quantitatively consistent with reported increases in the clear-ance of drugs that are not substrates of the knocked-out trans-porter. Overall, SAGE knockout rats demonstrated modest compensatory changes, which do not preclude their general application to study transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics. However, until future studies elucidate the magnitude of functional change, caution is warranted in rare instances of extensive metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase in Bcrp knockouts and intestinal carboxylesterase in Mdr 1 a knockout rats, specifically for molecules with free catechol groups and esters subject to gut-wall hydrolysis...|$|R
40|$|In drug {{discovery}} research, the compounds {{should not only}} to be potent and selective but also must possess acceptable pharmacokinetic properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) to increase success rate in clinical studies. Objective: Exploration of drug-like properties of 2 -(2 -methylquinolin- 4 -ylamino) -N-phenyl acetamide, a potent antileishmanial compound by performing some in vitro ADME experiments along with validation of such studies. Materials and Methods: Experimental protocols were established and validated for stability (in PBS pH 7. 4, simulated gastric and intestinal fluid), solubility, permeability, distribution coefficient (Log D), plasma protein binding and metabolism by rat liver microsomes by using spectrophotometer or HPLC. Methods were considered valid if {{the results of the}} standard compounds matched with reported results or within acceptable range or with proper ranking (high-medium-low). Results: The compound was found to be stable (> 95 &#x 0025; remaining) in all stability studies and aqueous solubility was 299. 7 &# 177; 6. 42 &# 956;M. The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) indicated its medium permeability (Log Pe = - 5. 53 &# 177; 0. 01). The distribution coefficients (Log D) in octanol/PBS and cyclohexane/PBS systems were found to be 0. 54 and - 1. 33, respectively. The plasma protein binding study by the equilibrium dialysis method was observed to be 78. 82 &# 177; 0. 13 &#x 0025; while metabolism by Phase-I enzymes for 1 hour at 37 &# 176;C revealed that 36. 07 &# 177; 4. 15 &#x 0025; of the compound remained after metabolism.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report covers two areas of investigation: 1) Devolatilisation of Isotopically Labelled Aromatics via Ge-based Phase-tagging: Isotopically labelled compounds are widely used within the pharmaceutical industry as trace quantities can be easily detected making them ideal for <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> on potential drug substances and their metabolites. Generic protocols for the phase-tagged synthesis of aryl-containing. intermediates from C 4 C]-bromobenzene (PhBr) and [14 C]-phenol (PhOH) have been developed. The protocols involve devolatilisation of the above mentioned intermediates {{during the early stages}} of synthesis thus avoiding health, environme' 1 tal, regulatory and cost issues associated with incomplete isotopic containment. In particular, this chemistry has been developed {{in the context of the}} synthesis of N-Bn- 4 -acetylamino- 4 -phenylpiperidine, a key precursor to numerous neuroexcitatory pharmaceuticals including the Sanofi-Aventis neurokinin antagonist saredutant (SR- 48968). The key elaboration steps are Ir-catalysed borylation, Suzuki cross-coupling and Mn-catalysed hydration. The approach constitutes a general strategy for the safe preparation of aryl-containing radiolabelled materials. 2) Towards the Total Synthesis of (+) -Lycorine: Work towards the development of a short asymmetric synthesis of the anti-tumour alkaloid (+) Iycorine using 1, 4 -addition to a cyclic enone and a refro-Cope elimination as key steps has been carried out. As part of this investigation, the diastereoselectivity of 1, 4 -addition of the lithium enolate of methyldithioacetate (. LMDTA) to 4 - 0 -TBS-cyclohex- 2 -en- 1 -one was examined in detail. This study has revealed an intriguing temperature dependent stereodivergency of this process. By controlling the reaction conditions either frans- or cis-selective conjugate addition could be achieved, allowing access to stereochemically defined products previously difficult to access by any other means.

Due to the low infectious doses, based on nano(bio) senzors, rapid and sensitive detection methods are developed for food-borne pathogens E. coli strains, especially E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, C. jejuni, E. cloacae, B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Also, sensors to detect biofilm formation by bacteria on surfaces are developing. Food preservation, detection and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formations are fast developing area based on advantage of metal nanomaterials that possess unique antimicrobial activities (such as silver, gold, copper, titanium, zink, magnesium, cadmium, alumina).

40|$|Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) is a nuclear physics technique developed about twenty years ago, {{that uses the}} high energy (several MeV) of a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator to measure very small quantities of rare and long-lived isotopes. Elements that are of interest in biomedicine and environmental sciences can be measured, often to parts per quadrillion sensitivity, i. e. zeptomole to attomole levels (10 (- 21) - 10 (- 18) mole) from milligram samples. This is several orders of magnitude lower than that achievable by conventional decay counting techniques, such as liquid scintillation counting (LSC). AMS was first applied to geochemical, climatological and archaeological areas, such as for radiocarbon dating (Shroud of Turin), but more recently this technology {{has been used for}} bioanalytical applications. In this sphere, most work has been conducted using aluminium, calcium and carbon isotopes. The latter is of special interest in drug metabolism studies, where a Phase 1 adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (<b>ADME)</b> <b>study</b> can be conducted using only 10 nanoCurie (37 Bq or ca. 0. 9 microSv) amounts or less of 14 C-labelled drugs. In the UK, these amounts of radioactivity are below those necessary to request specific regulatory approval from the Department of Health's Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC), thus saving on valuable development time and resources. In addition, the disposal of these amounts is much less an environmental issue than that associated with microCurie quantities, which are currently used. Also, AMS should bring an opportunity to conduct "first into man" studies without the need for widespread use of animals. Centre for Biomedical Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CBAMS) Ltd. is the first fully commercial company in the world to offer analytical services using AMS. With its high throughput and relatively low costs per sample analysis, AMS should be of great benefit to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as other life science areas...|$|R
40|$|Targeted mutant {{models are}} common in {{mechanistic}} toxicology experiments investigating the absorption, metabolism, distribution, or elimination (ADME) of chemicals from individuals. Key models include those for xenosensing transcription factors and cytochrome P 450 s (CYP). Here we investigated changes in transcript levels, protein expression, and steroid hydroxylation of several xenobiotic detoxifying CYPs in constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) -null and two CYP-null mouse models that have subfamily members regulated by CAR; the Cyp 3 a-null and a newly described Cyp 2 b 9 / 10 / 13 -null mouse model. Compensatory changes in CYP expression that occur in these models may also occur in polymorphic humans, or may complicate interpretation of <b>ADME</b> <b>studies</b> performed using these models. The loss of CAR causes significant changes in several CYPs probably due to loss of CAR-mediated constitutive regulation of these CYPs. Expression and activity changes include significant repression of Cyp 2 a and Cyp 2 b members with corresponding drops in 6 α- and 16 β-testosterone hydroxylase activity. Further, the ratio of 6 α-/ 15 α-hydroxylase activity, a biomarker of sexual dimorphism in the liver, indicates masculinization of female CAR-null mice, suggesting a role for CAR in the regulation of sexually dimorphic liver CYP profiles. The loss of Cyp 3 a causes fewer changes than CAR. Nevertheless, there are compensatory changes including gender-specific increases in Cyp 2 a and Cyp 2 b. Cyp 2 a and Cyp 2 b were down-regulated in CAR-null mice, suggesting activation of CAR and potentially PXR following loss of the Cyp 3 a members. However, the loss of Cyp 2 b causes few changes in hepatic CYP transcript levels and almost no significant compensatory changes in protein expression or activity {{with the possible exception}} of 6 α-hydroxylase activity. This lack of a compensatory response in the Cyp 2 b 9 / 10 / 13 -null mice is probably due to low CYP 2 B hepatic expression, especially in male mice. Overall, compensatory and regulatory CYP changes followed the order CAR-null > Cyp 3 a-null > Cyp 2 b-null mice...|$|R

40|$|Persistent hyperglycemia, {{impairment}} of redox status and establishment of inflammatory pathophysiology integrally play {{important role in}} the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). Present study examined the therapeutic potential of protocatechuic acid isolated from the Sansevieria roxburghiana rhizomes against DC employing rodent model of type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). T 2 D was induced by high fat diet + a low-single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, i. p.). T 2 D rats exhibited significantly (p < 0. 01) high fasting blood glucose level. Alteration in serum lipid profile (p < 0. 01) and increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0. 01) and creatine kinase (p < 0. 01) in the sera of T 2 D rats revealed the occurrence of hyperlipidemia and diabetic pathophysiology. A significantly (p < 0. 01) high levels of serum C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory mediators revealed the establishment of inflammatory occurrence in T 2 D rats. Besides, significantly high levels of troponins in the sera revealed the establishment of cardiac dysfunctions in T 2 D rats. However, protocatechuic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg, p. o.) treatment could significantly reverse the changes in serum biochemical parameters related to cardiac dysfunctions. Molecular mechanism studies demonstrated {{impairment of}} signaling cascade, IRS 1 /PI 3 K/Akt/AMPK/p 38 /GLUT 4, in glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle of T 2 D rats. Significant (p < 0. 01) activation of polyol pathway, enhanced production of AGEs, oxidative stress and up-regulation of inflammatory signaling cascades (PKC/NF-κB/PARP) were observed in the myocardial tissue of T 2 D rats. However, protocatechuic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg, p. o.) treatment could significantly (p < 0. 05 – 0. 01) stimulate glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle, regulated glycemic and lipid status, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and restored the myocardial physiology in T 2 D rats near to normalcy. Histological assessments were also in agreement with the above findings.
