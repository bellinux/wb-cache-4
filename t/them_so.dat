5|$|The {{civilian}} posse {{arrived at}} the battleground as the fighting finished. Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without <b>them</b> <b>so</b> {{he would not have}} to share the glory or the spoils of war.|$|E

5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat <b>them</b> <b>so</b> severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|At age 15, {{with her}} parents' approval, she filed for {{emancipation}} from <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> she could better pursue her acting career with less interference from child labor work laws. After completing ninth grade at Santa Fe Christian Schools, in Solana Beach, California, she left school because of severe bullying. Subsequently, Williams was home-tutored {{by her father}} and later graduated with a GED from a correspondence school.|$|E
5|$|Beyonc√© Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness <b>them</b> <b>so</b> {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E

5|$|Celia Solis (Daniella Baltodano), {{one of the}} Solis' daughters, {{comes down}} with chickenpox. Since Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) has never had the illness, she is forced to leave the house. She stays with neighbors Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm), where she enjoys partying and {{drinking}} with <b>them</b> <b>so</b> much she tries to prolong her visit. During a party, Gabrielle accidentally stumbles into a nursery, and learns Bob and Lee {{have been trying to}} adopt a baby. With a new appreciation for her children, Gabrielle returns home.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing <b>them</b> <b>so</b> much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated <b>them</b> <b>so,</b> {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, they asked for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind <b>them.</b> <b>So,</b> taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated <b>them</b> <b>so</b> kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> users can drill down or up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests {{that it should be}} considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay <b>them</b> <b>so</b> Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} of {{the individual}} power that lies inside every person, their ability to be their own hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero. Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire those around <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world. Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled <b>them</b> <b>so</b> that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E

5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
