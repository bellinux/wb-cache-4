5|$|According to Alfonso Archi, Hidar was {{succeeded by}} Isqi-Mari whose royal seal was {{discovered}} and it depicts battle scenes, causing Archi <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was responsible for}} the destruction of Ebla while still a general. Just a decade after Ebla's destruction (c. 2300 BC middle chronology), Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad, Michael Astour give the date as c. 2265 BC (short chronology).|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records seem <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sent by Darius to Ionia at around {{about the time of}} Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and infrequent game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be leaving the club during the January transfer window in order to rediscover his form.|$|E

50|$|Hokutōfuji's {{performances}} <b>to</b> date <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is an oshi-sumo {{specialist who}} favours pushing techniques to {{fighting on the}} mawashi or belt. He wins roughly half his bouts with a straightforward oshi-dashi, or push out.|$|R

5|$|Pain's family {{originated}} in Normandy, {{but there is}} little <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had many ties there, and he appears to have spent most of his career in England and the Welsh Marches. A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115, he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of Ludlow and its castle, which he augmented with further acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|The final {{series of}} the home stand {{featured}} the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching led some <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would retire after the season, he dominated game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings for a 3–2 win. The Phillies' success continued the next day, when Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three RBIs in a 4–3 victory. The team swept the series when Sizemore entered the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, and his two-run homer helped the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Battuta {{remained}} in Mecca {{for some time}} (the Rihla suggests about three years, from September 1327 until autumn 1330). Problems with chronology, however, lead commentators <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have left after the 1328 hajj.|$|E
25|$|When Ursicinus was {{dismissed}} from his military post by Constantinus, Ammianus too {{seems to have}} retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in Julian's Persian campaigns has led modern scholarship <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.|$|E

25|$|Between 1861 and 1871 Gibbons was {{developing}} his own stamp business, {{although there is}} no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had advertised prices prior to 1864. In 1867, Edward’s father died and Edward took over the business. However, by this time he was heavily involved in stamp dealing and the pharmaceutical business his father had left him was sold.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{reluctance}} {{to play the}} role, Gable {{is best known for}} his performance in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which he gained a Best Actor Oscar nomination.

25|$|The {{evidence}} whether Wren was a speculative freemason is {{the subject}} of the Prestonian Lecture of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey's memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.|$|E

He requested the involvement of Scotland Yard in the investigations, questioning the credibility of Jamaican police. He also alleged that the match Pakistan lost against West Indies in the World Cup 2007 was fixed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reign}} of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears {{as one of the}} abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the {{programme}} of Benedictine reform. Writing c. 1000, the Ramsey monk Byrhtferth relates that under the auspices of Oswald, bishop of Worcester, seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore. The first abbot was one Foldbriht, whose name is sufficiently rare <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop Æthelwold previously installed at Abingdon and used to be a monk of Glastonbury before that time.|$|E
