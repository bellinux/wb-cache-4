500|$|Neil Perryman of the University of Sunderland feels {{this episode}} {{is a prime}} example of <b>transmedia</b> {{storytelling}} in Doctor Who and Torchwood, describing the episode and ancillary online material released after its airing being in part an attempt at continuity management.

Fans had asked how the eponymous Cyberwoman was not sucked into the void along with the rest of her kin during the climax to the Doctor Who episode ‘Doomsday’ (8 July 2006) and the site retroactively explained away the problem: ‘The only exceptions were those being converted with material entirely derived from this side of the void’, which allowed the events of ‘Cyberwoman’ to take place without contradicting what viewers originally saw in the episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, P-Orridge {{dropped out}} of {{university}} and moved to London, and joined the <b>Transmedia</b> Explorations commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in Islington Park Street. The group, initiated by the artist David Medalla and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, {{had been at the}} forefront of the London hippy scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case. Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a kinetic artist, and would recognise Fitzgerald's formative influence in P-Orridge's later work. The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of deconditioning its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969, when they decided to leave; they were angered that the commune's leaders were given more rights than the other members, and believed that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something P-Orridge took a great interest in. Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge's time at the <b>Transmedia</b> Explorations commune had been brief, [...] "the experiences he had there proved to be seminal" [...] to his artistic development.|$|E

2500|$|Cine Foundation International, a [...] "non-profit film {{company and}} human rights NGO aiming to 'empower open {{consciousness}} through cinema'" [...] announced on 3 January 2011 that they are launching a campaign of protest films and public actions calling {{for the release of}} Panahi.

2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a <b>transmedia</b> storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back in my day we'd have this payload delivered'. And then you get a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, {{and he would say}} something like, [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E
