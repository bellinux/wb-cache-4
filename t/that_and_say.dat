2500|$|In 2013, Jesse Katz, {{a former}} Los Angeles Times reporter, {{said of the}} LA Times coverage: [...] "As an L.A. Times reporter, we saw this series in the San Jose Mercury News and kind of wonder how legit it was and kind of put it under a microscope, {{and we did it}} in a way that most of us who were {{involved}} in it, I think, would look back on <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California." [...] And [...] "we really didn't do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter's career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{survived to}} stand trial on 19 October 1880 in Melbourne before the Irish-born judge Justice Sir Redmond Barry. Mr Smyth and Mr Chomley {{appeared}} for the crown and Mr Bindon for the prisoner. The trial was adjourned to 28 October, when Kelly was presented on the charge {{of the murder of}} Sergeant Kennedy, Constable Scanlan and Lonigan, the various bank robberies, the murder of Sherritt, resisting arrest at Glenrowan and with a long list of minor charges. He was convicted of the willful murder of Constable Lonigan and was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Barry. Several unusual exchanges between Kelly and the judge included the judge's customary words [...] "May God have mercy on your soul", to which Kelly replied [...] "I will go a little further than <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> I will see you there where I go." [...] At Kelly's request, his picture was taken and he was granted farewell interviews with family members. His mother's last words to him were reported to be [...] "Mind you die like a Kelly." ...|$|E

The Pentagon confirmed <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> the drone, used for gathering weather and temperature data, is not armed. The drone was returned several days later.|$|R

60|$|Three {{quarters}} past eleven! The murmur now was deafening, yet {{every man}} seemed mute.

Daisy tells him she has to let him go because she does not want the house to be an unsafe environment for any of the contestants.|$|R

60|$|I found poor Pon in {{his study}} among his boots, in such a rueful {{attitude}} of despondency, that I could not but remark it. 'Look at that!' says the poor fellow, handing me over a document. 'It's the second change in uniform since he's been in the army, and yet there's no extravagance about the lad. Lord Gules tells me {{he is the most}} careful youngster in the regiment, God bless him! But look at that! by heaven, Snob, look at <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> how can a man of nine hundred keep out of the Bench?' He gave a sob as he handed me the paper across the table; and his old face, and his old corduroys, and his shrunk shooting-jacket, and his lean shanks, looked, as he spoke, more miserably haggard, bankrupt, and threadbare.|$|E
60|$|In his {{ordinary}} mood Herbert Fitzgerald was by {{no means}} a quarrelsome man. Indeed we may go further than <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that he was very much the reverse. His mind was argumentative rather than impulsive, and in all matters he was readier to persuade than overcome. But his ordinary nature had been changed. It was quite new with him to be nervous and fretful, but he was so at the present moment. He was deeply concerned in the circumstances around him, but yet had been allowed no voice in them. In this affair that was so peculiarly his own,--this of his promised bride, he was determined that no voice should be heard but his own; and now, contrary to his wont, he was ready enough to quarrel with his cousin.|$|E

50|$|Some linguists, {{following}} William J. Samarin, classify it as a Ngbandi-based creole; however, others (like Marcel Diki-Kidiri, Charles H.

60|$|From his nest {{among the}} pillows, Paul {{could see and}} hear almost {{everything}} that passed {{as if the whole}} were being done for his amusement. Among other little incidents that he observed, he observed Mr Baps the dancing-master get into conversation with Sir Barnet Skettles, and very soon ask him, as he had asked Mr Toots, what you were to do with your raw materials, when they came into your ports in return for your drain of gold--which was such a mystery to Paul that he was quite desirous to know what ought to be done with them. Sir Barnet Skettles had much to say upon the question, and said it; but it did not appear to solve the question, for Mr Baps retorted, Yes, but supposing Russia stepped in with her tallows; which struck Sir Barnet almost dumb, for he could only shake his head after <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> Why then you must fall back upon your cottons, he supposed.|$|E

At first I congratulated him, {{thinking}} your boy's offer must please him, {{as it would have}} pleased any fellow in our time to have a shot. Dammy! but I was mistaken in my man. He entered into some confounded long-winded story about a marriage you wanted to make with that infernal pretty sister of his, who is going to marry young Farintosh, and how you were in a rage because the scheme fell to the ground, and how a family duel might occasion unpleasantries to Miss Newcome; though I showed him how this could be most easily avoided, and that the lady's name need never appear in the transaction. 'Confound it, Sir Barnes,' says I, 'I recollect this boy, when he was a youngster throwing a glass of wine in your face! We'll put it upon <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> it's an old feud between you.' He turned quite pale, and he said your fellow had apologised for the glass of wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I say, because St. Paul says it, 'that {{those who}} do such things shall surely die.' And do not some of you think me {{unreasonable}} in <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> in your heart, 'What! are we to be tongue-tied? Shall we not speak our minds?' Be it so, my good women, only remember this: {{that as long as}} you say that, you confess that you are not masters of your tongues, but your tongues are masters of you, and that you freely confess you owe service to your tongue, and not to God. Do not therefore complain of me for saying the very same thing, namely, that you think you are debtors to your flesh--to the tongues in your mouths, and must needs do what those same little unruly members choose, of which St James has said, 'The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, and it sets on fire the whole course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.' And again: 'If any person among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives himself, that person's religion is vain.' ...|$|E
