500|$|The soundtrack {{and audio}} effects were also well {{received}} by critics. Swan {{believed that the}} game utilised the SNES' PSM chip to its fullest potential, while both he and Glancey agreed that the game's sound effects were [...] "mindblowing". Thomas labelled the soundtrack as [...] "another one of Koji Kondo's classics", but in hindsight remarked {{that it was not}} as memorable as his earlier work.

In addition, both Goyon and Jason Schreider from Kotaku felt that its rhythmic sound effects were important helped reinforce the game's atmosphere. Miller liked Super Mario Worlds upbeat music and particularly enjoyed the echoing sound effects heard when Mario was underground—a sentiment shared by other reviewers. Both Sleeper and Navarro asserted that the game featured the best music in the entire Super Mario series, with Sleeper praising Kondo's [...] "timeless" [...] soundtrack and memorable melodies.|$|E
