5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E

In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little {{time to deal with}} household work.

5|$|After the draft, Milwaukee {{attempted}} to convince Yi {{to sign with}} the team and on 2 July 2007, {{the owner of the}} Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.|$|E

She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality.

5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the disqualified Joyce could remain in ministerial office for three months in accordance with , which could give <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be re-elected in a by-election.

He was replaced by Jonny Bairstow.|$|E
25|$|While not {{directly}} related to the issue of legality, the incident also raised questions about the citing process itself. Under the protocol applying to the Lions Tests, the citing commissioner had to make any decisions on whether to cite players within 12 hours {{of the end of the}} game. This, it was suggested, did not allow enough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> gather video evidence and properly analyse it. Subsequently, the citing 'window' has been extended to 24 hours for most matches.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton {{continued}} his {{form in the}} second session, this time leading the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa.

25|$|Keedy {{was signed}} by then Lancashire coach David Lloyd in a {{motorway}} service station. Although it took <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a leading light of the Lancashire attack, he was awarded his county cap in 2000.

25|$|Finally, just a {{week before}} the season began and after only a year on Teesside, Luke Young moved to Aston Villa for a fee of £5.5 million rising to £6 million based on appearances.

A replacement was brought in when Middlesbrough completed the £3 million signing of Arsenal's Justin Hoyte before {{the first game of the}} season, but not in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be eligible to play. The right-back signed a four-year contract.|$|E
25|$|When it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{choose an}} heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu.

Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future Hongxi Emperor), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from Xie Jin. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated {{and refused to}} give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located.
