40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on research of <b>the</b> general <b>duties</b> {{of members of the}} board of directors in a capital company, in particular <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty. Besides <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty, members {{of the board of directors}} have a duty to act with due managerial care. The doctrine paid attention to the specification of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to act with due managerial care but there has, as yet, been no attention paid to <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty. <b>The</b> new legislation contained in the Civil Code Act n. 89 / 2012 Sb. (CC) subordinates <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty under <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to act with due managerial care. The subject of the dissertation is research of the nature, origin, and function, of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty. <b>The</b> conclusion of the dissertation is the confirmation of the hypothesis, that <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty by which a member of the board of directors is bound, is a fiduciary duty and an independent duty, which is not a part of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to act with due managerial care...|$|R
5|$|Verses 1.27–40 are a non-yoga {{commentary}} on <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of four social classes – this section {{is missing in}} manuscripts of Yoga Yajnavalkya that contain 460 verses. The commentary presents two theories on <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of the four Varna in terms of ashrama dharmas of Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. One theory allows only the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to enter Brahmacharya and study the Vedas, and the other states that Shudras can also enter Brahmacharya.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Commandant, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps is {{appointed}} by the President based on advice and consent of the Senate and, once appointed, will be promoted to the grade of general. <b>The</b> <b>duties</b> of the Assistant Commandant include such authority and duties as the Commandant – and {{with the approval of}} the Secretary of the Navy – may delegate to or prescribe for him. Orders issued by the Assistant Commandant in performing such duties have the same effect as those issued by the Commandant. When there is a vacancy in the office of Commandant of the Marine Corps, or during the absence or disability of the Commandant, the Assistant Commandant shall perform <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of the Commandant until a successor is appointed or the absence or disability ceases.|$|E

30|$|From Eqs. (10) and (11), {{the delay}} will {{decrease}} with <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> cycle increase. Theorem 9 gives {{the relationship between}} the BER and <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> cycle in MPSK modulation technique, and the BER will decrease with <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> cycle increase. Therefore, the delay will decrease with <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> cycle increase. Therefore, the delay of network can be reduced by increasing <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of node which is far away from sink. Theorem 10 gives the calculation formula as follows.|$|R

5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E

40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} {{the importance of}} <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty, but the same is not true of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care. Historically, <b>the</b> corporate law <b>duty</b> of care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary duty of care. I hope to show that <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any of <b>the</b> individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust duty of care. Rather, I will defend <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> of care works in the corporate context precisely because caution is built into the enforcement equation...|$|R

5|$|As {{one of the}} Crown dependencies, Jersey is {{autonomous}} and self-governing, {{with its}} own independent legal, administrative and fiscal systems. In 1973, the Royal Commission on the Constitution set out <b>the</b> <b>duties</b> of the Crown as including: ultimate responsibility for the 'good government' of the Crown dependencies; ratification of island legislation by Order in Council (Royal Assent); international representation, subject to consultation with the island authorities before concluding any agreement which would apply to them; ensuring the islands meet their international obligations; and defence.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. The Spirit Duties.--We laid 8d. {{per gallon}} upon Irish spirits, imposed {{at the same}} time 1s. per gallon in Scotland, and laid it down that the {{equalisation}} of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> in <b>the</b> three countries would require a reduction of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of 8s. chargeable in England. Sir Robert Peel had imposed 1s. per gallon on Irish spirits in 1842, but was defeated by the smuggler, and repealed <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> in consequence of the failure. In 1842 <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> was levied by a separate revenue police.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>duty</b> {{to defend}} is a {{liability}} insurer's <b>duty</b> to defend <b>the</b> insured against claims.

It covers both civil suits and alternative dispute resolution procedures.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparison}} between <b>the</b> Czech <b>duty</b> of due managerial care {{of a member of}} governing body of limited company and <b>the</b> Irish non-fiduciary <b>duty</b> to exercise care, skill and diligence of a director of limited company (hereinafter also referred as "duty of care"). The paper aims to find out a possible way to improve legislation of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of due managerial care on the basis of comparison with <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care. <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> of care sets the ground for the comparison, therefore the paper deals first with the Irish legal status of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care, which has been recently changed by the Companies Act 2014. Despite of the codification of <b>the</b> directors' <b>duties,</b> <b>the</b> core of interpretation and application of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care still rests in judicial decisions. Nevertheless, the change of source and statutory wording of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> means that <b>the</b> substance of Re City Equitable [1925] does not represent a good law anymore. The standard of care of Re City Equitable [1925] has been replaced by the minimal objective standard based on the British judgment Re D'Jan of London [1994]. The content of <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care is determined on the case by case basis, but in any event it consists of conclusions of the British judgment Re Barings [1999], which has been accepted by the Irish courts in restriction [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Under {{well-established}} {{principles of}} nonprofit corporation law, {{a board member}} must meet certain standards of conduct and attention in carrying out his or her responsibilities to the organization. Several states have statutes adopting some variation of these duties which would be used in court {{to determine whether a}} board member acted improperly. These standards are usually described as <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of care, <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty, and <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of obedience. <b>Duty</b> of Care <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> of care describes the level of competence that is expected of a board member and is commonly expressed as <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of "care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in a like position and under similar circumstances. " This means that a board member owes <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision as a steward of <b>the</b> organization. <b>Duty</b> of Loyalty <b>The</b> <b>duty</b> of loyalty is a standard of faithfulness; a board member must give undivided allegiance when making decisions affecting the organization. This means that a board member can never use information obtained as a member for personal gain, but must act {{in the best interests of}} the organization...|$|R
