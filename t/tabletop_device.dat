50|$|The range {{correction}} {{board is}} pictured below. This was a <b>tabletop</b> <b>device</b> (that resembled a 1940s-vintage wide-carriage mechanical adding machine, without the operating arm on the side) {{that was used}} to figure out the individual corrections that might be required for factors #1 through #7 above and to cumulate these. The result from the range correction board was fed to a slide rule-like device called a percentage corrector to obtain the corrections (if any) to be sent to the gun/s. The range correction board made use of a paper chart that was rolled onto its working surface and offered non-standard curves from which corrections could be read off. This chart had to be specific to the combination of gun, power charge, and projectile in use at the time. Values for the individual factors (#1 through #7 above) had to be obtained by plotting room personnel from battery officers or from the hourly meteorological message.|$|E

As a new addition to the service experience, <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> offer the customer {{more control over the}} dining experience, and also increase customer participation in the service process, which has the potential to upset the traditional exchange between service providers and customers in restaurants. To examine how customers react to the use of <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices,</b> this study examines 1, 343 point-of-sales transactions from 20 units of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain and matches customer in-restaurant transactions to their reactions to <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> used during their meals. Results show that over 70 % of the customers who used <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> reported positive affect toward the device, with approximately 79 % of customers reporting that the device improved their experience, citing convenience, ease of use, and credit card security as some benefits of using the technology. Approximately 80 % of the customers who used the device reported that they would return to the restaurant because of the positive affect. The results also indicate that likeability of the device and tip percentage were positively and significantly connected to customer reports of the devices having a positive effect on experience and on desire to return. In addition, when customers reported increased return intentions, likeability of the device was higher regardless of reports of the device improving restaurant experience, showing that the introduction of <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> had a positive effect for most—but not all—customers...|$|R

40|$|Soft {{keyboards}} offer touch-capable {{mobile and}} <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> many advantages such as multiple language support and space for larger graphical displays.

In this paper, we describe how overly aggressive key-target resizing can sometimes prevent users from typing their desired text, violating basic user expectations about keyboard functionality. We propose an anchored key-target method which aims to provide an input method that is robust to errors while respecting usability principles.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some aspects}} of the usefulness of interactive tabletop systems, if and how these impact collaboration. We chose creative problem solving such as brainstorming as an application framework to test several collaborative media: the use of pen-and-paper tools, the ‘‘around-the-table’’ form factor, the digital tabletop interface, the attractiveness of interaction styles. Eighty subjects in total (20 groups of four members) participated in the experiments. The evaluation criteria were task performance, collaboration patterns (especially equity of contributions), and users’ subjective experience. The ‘‘aroundthe-table’’ form factor, which is hypothesized to promote social comparison, increased performance and improved collaboration through an increase of equity. Moreover, the attractiveness of the <b>tabletop</b> <b>device</b> improved subjective experience and increased motivation to engage in the task. However, designing attractiveness seems a highly challenging issue, since overly attractive interfaces may distract users from the task...|$|E

40|$|At {{the core}} of {{attosecond}} science lies the ability to generate laser pulses of subfemtosecond duration. In <b>tabletop</b> <b>devices</b> the process relies on high-harmonic generation, where a major challenge is to obtain high yields and high cutoff energies required for the generation of attosecond pulses. We develop a computational method that can simultaneously resolve these issues by optimizing the driving pulses using quantum optimal control theory. Our target functional, an integral over the harmonic yield over a desired energy range, leads to a remarkable cutoff extension and yield enhancement for a one-dimensional model H atom. The physical enhancement process is shown to be twofold: the cutoff extension is of classical origin, whereas the yield enhancement arises from increased tunneling probability. The scheme is directly applicable to more realistic models and, within straightforward refinements, also to experimental verification.

This intuitive interaction paradigm rapidly became popular, {{particularly in the}} domain of individual mobile devices. Collaborative work on large scale multi-touch devices, instead, suffers from mutual interferences if many simultaneous touch events cannot be attributed to individual users.

The targeted <b>tabletop</b> <b>device</b> uses a pyroelectric crystal to create an electric field that accelerates deuterium ions towards a deuterated target to produce neutrons via fusion.

A vacuum chamber in which to operate this device in a partial vacuum (and then later with deuterated gas) has been designed and is currently being fabricated. The project will continue next semester with the completed vacuum chamber and the conversion of the pyroelectric X-ray generator to a pyrofusion neutron generator. The neutrons will be characterized and used to further study particle interactions by Indiana University undergraduate students.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{temperature}} and related shrinking kinetics of gutta-percha injected from heat guns are not known; therefore, we investigated {{them in this}} study. METHODS The temperatures of 3 different backfill gutta-percha brands extruded from 3 commercially available heat guns set to 200 °C were studied. To validate the results, temperature development of 1 gutta-percha brand injected from a heat gun during a simulated backfilling procedure was assessed in single-rooted human teeth containing thermocouples in a water bath of 37 °C. These values were compared with the counterparts obtained in a <b>tabletop</b> testing <b>device</b> for shrinkage at an ambient temperature of 37 °C. Using this device, linear shrinkage upon cooling was assessed for all 3 gutta-percha brands under investigation. Results were compared by parametric statistics (alpha =. 05). RESULTS The temperatures of extruded gutta-percha differed significantly (P <. 05) between heat guns and gutta-percha brands. Mean temperatures ranging between 57. 6 ° ± 4. 5 °C and 103. 9 ° ± 7. 8 °C could be observed with different combinations. The temperature of extruded gutta-percha in tabletop experiments equaled that observed in the root canals. However, the cooling of gutta-percha was (P <. 05) faster in the <b>tabletop</b> measuring <b>device</b> compared with the root canal environment. Within the controlled temperature drop from 75 °C to 37 °C, the total shrinkage differed significantly (P <. 05) between the 3 gutta-percha brands under investigation and ranged between 0. 96 % ± 0. 20 % and 2. 31 % ± 0. 26 % after 10 minutes (P <. 05). Shrinking kinetics showed different patterns between the gutta-percha brands. CONCLUSIONS Gutta-percha designed for thermoplastic application shrinks quickly and extensively upon cooling...|$|R
