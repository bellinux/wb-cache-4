5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials insist <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|Fluctuations in {{the orbits}} of the moons {{indicate}} that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface {{and the way it}} rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating {{as a result of the}} gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.|$|E

25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge {{premiums}} and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while {{the federal government will}} save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long-term effect <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> on the program.|$|E

25|$|The BT Group owned (but Virgin Media leased) Milton Keynes {{franchise}} {{which was}} analogue-only was switched off in November 2013. BT's Openreach division selected Milton Keynes {{for a large}} scale fibre-to-the-premises trial (as opposed to fibre-to-the-cabinet {{in other parts of}} the UK). It remains to be seen what impact, if any, <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> on the viability of the Virgin Media leasing arrangement of the analogue HFC network there, which, uniquely, is believed to pass through BT infrastructure – not wholly VM's. The leasing arrangement dates back to 1999 and was mandated by the European Union in response to competition concerns surrounding BT's Cable TV interests in Milton Keynes and Westminster. Virgin Media completely withdrew its services in Westminster on 31 January 2012, after being unable to upgrade the network and deliver their digital services at a reasonable cost. The Milton Keynes cable network, which has a significant number of users due to technical satellite and aerial reception issues down to local geography, does not suffer the same 'conservation' area rules as the Borough of Westminster, and thus, has been spared for now.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{alternate}} strategy for identifying fit mates {{which does not}} rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a non-silent mutation will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged {{is made up of}} fit attributes that have attained their plurality through natural selection, while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare. Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the effect of a sexual population rapidly shedding peripheral phenotypic features, thereby canalizing the entire outward appearance and behavior of all of its members. They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the African pygmy kingfisher, Ispidina picta. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered evolutionarily stable, including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example above of the selfish individual who hangs back {{from the rest of the}} hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate. Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.|$|E

500|$|A {{diplexer}} is {{a device}} used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands {{into a single}} signal. [...] This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device {{can be used to}} separate the signals again {{at the far end of}} the channel. [...] The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. [...] Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. [...] <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. [...] These problems could be overcome with the use of a [...] directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.|$|E
500|$|Amy wakes on 26 June 2010 in {{her home}} to {{discover}} that her parents have been brought back into existence and she and Rory celebrate their wedding day. At the reception, River leaves her blank diary for Amy which prompts Amy to recall the Doctor and something he told {{her when she was}} seven during his rewind. She interrupts her father's speech, imploring the [...] "Raggedy" [...] Doctor from her memories to come back. As she recites the old wedding proverb ("something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue"), relating that to what the Doctor had said about the TARDIS, the TARDIS and the Doctor appear. The Doctor comes out of the TARDIS and after a brief conversation with Amy, introduces himself by saying [...] "Hello everyone! I'm Amy's imaginary friend, but I came anyway!" [...] and joins the wedding festivities. Afterwards, he returns River's diary and the vortex manipulator to her so she can return to her own time. She sadly tells him he will soon learn who she truly is and that it will change everything. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor explains to Amy and Rory that unanswered questions remain about the destruction of the TARDIS and the nature of [...] "the silence" [...] that will fall. The Doctor receives a telephone call alerting him to the presence of [...] "an escaped Egyptian goddess on the Orient Express, in space".
