The next day, the chronicle states that <b>the</b> <b>invading</b> forces left the shores of Mann. Ívarr's connection to the Manx attack on <b>the</b> <b>invading</b> forces of Eóghan and Magnús suggests that there was still considerable opposition on Mann by adherents of Haraldr to the prospect of Magnús' kingship there.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} {{bacterial}} species was reduced in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> plots at {{two out of}} the three sites while as it was relatively higher in the un-invaded plots with many species exclusively found in these plots.

30|$|Overall, {{our results}} {{allow us to}} {{conclude}} that C. sumatrensis does alter the soil microbial diversity in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> habitats. Not only it reduces the bacterial species diversity in invaded plots but also some bacterial species are characteristically restricted only to plots invaded by this species. Similarly, fungal species richness was also higher in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> {{as compared to the}} un-invaded plots at all the three sites with some species restricted exclusively to <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> plots. Unraveling <b>the</b> mechanism of how C. sumatrensis changes soil microbial communities and whether it draws these communities to its advantage at the cost of native species promises to be an interesting future discourse. Equally interesting is to understand how this invasion-induced change in soil microbial community composition influences native plant species in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> urban ecosystems.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} Caulerpa taxifolia on the {{structure}} of shallow Posidonia oceanica beds was studied in permanent quadrats from 1995 to 2005 at <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> site of Cap Martin and the control site of Cap d’Antibes (French Riviera, France). The cover of C. taxifolia, shoot density, number of orthotropic and plagiotropic shoots and proportion of ramifications of P. oceanica were measured yearly. The cover of C. taxifolia in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> zone rapidly reached a maximum of infestation in 2000 with 93 % of the quadrats covered by the alga. In 2001 an unexplained phenomenon led to a sharp decrease in the infestation and in the following years the colonisation remained low. Within the 10 years of the study, P. oceanica did not disappear from the permanent quadrats, but we observed a drastic change in the structure of <b>the</b> meadow <b>invaded</b> by C. taxifolia. Between 1999 and 2000 a decrease in the shoot density observed at both sites was probably related to the warm temperature event recorded in 1999 (from 636 to 143 shoots m- 2 at <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> site and from 488 to 277 at the control site). At <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> site, <b>the</b> seagrass never recovered its initial density even after a sharp decrease in C. taxifolia. The orthotropic/plagiotropic shoot ratio was strongly modified at <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> site, where plagiotropic shoots became dominant because of an increase in their ramification...|$|R
40|$|Introduced {{plant species}} can become locally {{dominant}} and threaten native flora and fauna. This dominance is often {{thought to be}} a result of release from specialist enemies in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range, or <b>the</b> evolution of increased competitive ability. Soil borne microorganisms have often been overlooked as enemies in this context, but a less deleterious plant soil interaction in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range could explain local dominance. Two plant species, Carpobrotus edulis and the hybrid Carpobrotus X cf. acinaciformis, are considered major pests in the Mediterranean basin. We tested if release from soil-borne enemies and/or evolution of increased competitive ability could explain this dominance. Comparing biomass production in non-sterile soil with that in sterilized soil, we found that inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the native range reduced biomass production by 32 % while inoculation with rhizosphere soil from <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range did not {{have a significant effect on}} plant biomass. Genotypes from <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range, including a hybrid, did not perform better than plants from the native range in sterile soil. Hence evolution of increased competitive ability and hybridization do not seem to play a major role. We conclude that the reduced negative net impact of the soil community in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range may contribute to the success of Carpobrotus species in the Mediterranean basin...|$|R
30|$|The {{bacterial}} DNA amplified {{from the}} study sites grouped mainly into Sphingobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. No phylogenetic group, however, was distinctively favored or inhibited by C. sumatrensis invasion. At all the three sites, the bacterial groups that were shared between invaded and un-invaded plots were not present in the same abundance at the two kinds of plots, e.g., Sphingobacteria formed 34  % of the identified sequences in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> plots but only 16  % in the un-invaded plots; Betaproteobacteria which formed 13  % of the total identified sequences in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> plots formed only 8  % in the un-invaded plots. Cyanobacteria were found in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> plots whereas Acidobacteria occurred exclusively in un-invaded plots.|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the levels {{and distribution of}} genetic diversity in Eurasian and North American populations of Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv.

Our goals were to identify source regions for invasive populations, {{determine the number of}} independent invasion events, and assess the possibility that postinvasion bottlenecks and hybridization have affected patterns of genetic diversity in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range. We tested the hypothesis that this Eurasian grass was accidentally introduced into two areas in Oregon and one site in California by examining nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast haplotype variation in 23 introduced and 25 native populations. In <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range, there was significantly lower allelic richness (RS), observed heterozygosity (HO) and within-population gene diversity (HS), although a formal test failed to detect a significant genetic bottleneck. Most of the genetic variation existed among populations in the native range but within populations in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range. All of the allelic variation in <b>the</b> <b>invaded</b> range could be explained based on alleles found in western European populations.
