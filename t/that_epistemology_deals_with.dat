40|$|Some of the {{problems}} raised in the target text for this Forum may be alleviated by a consideration of three distinctions about concepts and categories. These include the distinctions between: (1) metaphysica 1 ver-sus epistemological accounts of concepts, (2) the core versus the identifi-cation procedure of a concept, and (3) different kinds of concepts. I con-sider these distinctions in turn. Metaphysical versus Epistemological Accounts of Concepts The difference between metaphysical and epistemological approaches to concepts is crucial for understanding border disputes between philos-ophers and psychologists. This difference is discussed at length in the exchange between Rey 1983, 1985, a philosopher, and Smith, Medin, and Rips 1984, psychologists all, and what follows borrows heavily from that exchange. Metaphysics <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> how the world is (which is investigated by science), while <b>epistemology</b> <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> how w e know, believe, infer how the zuorld is (Rey 1983).

How exact are economic theories and can they lay claim to the status of an exact science - for example, are economic predictions as reliable as predictions in the natural sciences, and why or why not?

" One is interested not only in each person's knowledge about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge about the others' knowledge. This paper examines two parallel approaches to the subject. The first is the semantic approach, in which knowledge is represented by a space of states of the world, together with partitions ℐi of for each player i; the atom of ℐi containing a given state of the world represents i's knowledge at that state - the set of those other states that i cannot distinguish from. The second is the syntactic approach, in which knowledge is embodied in sentences constructed according to certain syntactic rules. This paper examines the relation between the two approaches, and shows that they are in a sense equivalent. In game theory and economics, the semantic approach has heretofore been most prevalent. A question that often arises in this connection is whether, in what sense, and why the space and the partitions ℐi can be taken as given and commonly known by the players. An answer to this question is provided by the syntactic approach. Epistemology · interactive epistemology · knowledge · common knowledge · semantic · syntactic · model...|$|R

40|$|Fallibilism, {{the thesis}} that no belief can be known for certain, has become a popular view in epistemology. The {{certainty}} of our perceptions, inductions, faculties of reason, and even self-knowledge are regularly challenged. On this view, most of <b>epistemology</b> then <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> knowledge <b>that</b> is probably fallible. However, knowledge of our own primitive feelings may avert the likely fallibility of other sources of knowledge. In this paper I argue that primitive feelings are an infallible source of knowledge {{even in the face}} of the strongest fallibilist challenges, by exploring what kinds of things that, if believed, must be true. I address the matter first by determining what kinds of things that, if they are true, we must be justified in believing if and when we believe them. Next I determine what can be believed only if true. Then I show that primitive feeling fulfills both of these. Finally, since primitive feelings do fulfill these requirements, I show that if the feelings are believed then necessarily they are also known for certain. Then I address challenges that pose issues for self-knowledge and explain how they do not create real problems for primitive feelings even if they do for other kinds of self-knowledge. Through this process, I refine into a tightly understandable category what constitutes these sorts of feelings that, if believable, are also infallibly knowable. From there we can come to know for certain some things about the world we exist in...|$|R

40|$|Studying the {{overlaps}} {{between religion}} and politics in human geography {{is no longer a}} niche pursuit. Now, a plethora of literature in the discipline covers various facets of the topic, analysing {{the role of religion in}} contexts ranging from welfare contracts to geopolitical imaginations. Furthermore, investigating the religion/politics interface has been enhanced in recent years by increasing theoretical innovation in religious geography, incorporating poststructural epistemologies into the subdiscipline. This shift has directed geographers to the fluid construction of practices and places through the everyday lives of religious subjects and communities. Despite these developments, I argue that studies at the religion/politics interface still lack an <b>epistemology</b> <b>that</b> can adequately comprehend emerging empirical work in geography and associated disciplines that highlights the blurring of religious praxis into activism. Geographers have rarely represented the mechanisms that produce the heterogeneity of religious involvement in politics, putting the new poststructural epistemologies in the subdiscipline to work by categorising religious subjects and communities as homogeneously progressive or regressive, or focussing instead on the affective atmospheres and internal dynamics of faith communities. In this thesis I argue that in order to understand religious involvement in activism, geographers of religion need to begin to blend poststructural <b>epistemologies</b> <b>that</b> attend to the everyday fluidity of religion with epistemological work on networks in activist geographies. This is necessary work because these two realms are beginning to intermingle on the ground, consequently highlighting the production of religious subjectivities between religious and activist practices. In response to this gap between theory and empirics, I turn my attention to faith communities that embody elements of a postchristendom ethos, flattening religious hierarchies, welcoming difference, and engaging beyond themselves through social justice activism. By addressing this context I can underscore the knowledges that geographies of the religion/politics interface have missed so far, examining the multiple factors at play in the formation of faith community raison d’êtres, the accommodation of difference in faith communities, and how religious subjects negotiate their praxis between religious and activist spaces. By drawing attention to these issues and developing an <b>epistemology</b> to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them, this thesis develops more nuanced ways of producing knowledge about religious subjectivities and communities as they relate to activism...|$|R
40|$|Economics {{places a}} high premium on {{completeness}} of explanation. Typical general-equilibrium accounts of economic phenomena are preferred to partial equilibrium accounts {{on the ground}} that important interactions are necessarily omitted in the latter. A similar preference for microfoundational explanations over macroeconomic explanations of aggregate phenomena is grounded in similar reasoning. Probabilistic accounts of causation frequently presume that greater detail is superior to less. Simpson’s paradox, for example, assumes that failure to account for distinctions within populations results in false conclusions. Strategies of causal refinement – e. g., distinguishing between direct and indirect causes – are similar. However, there are countervailing practices in economics. Representative-agent models aim to capture economic motivation but not to reduce the level of aggregation. Structural vector-autoregression models and dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium models with small numbers of variables are often practically preferred to ones with large numbers. The distinction between endogenous variables determined within a causal system and exogenous variables determined independently of the causal system suggests a partitioning of the world into distinct subsystems. This paper will explore this tension. I advocate a structural account of causation grounded in Herbert Simon’s "Causal Order and Identifiability" (1953), which defines cause with reference to complete systems. But any workable causal <b>epistemology</b> must <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> incomplete systems and piecemeal evidence. The main formal focus of the paper is to better understand the constraints that a structural account of causation places on the freedom to model complex or lower-order systems as simpler or higher-order systems.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{the need to}} look beyond the coastal zone and adopt an ecosystem-based approach to sustainable use and conservation in marine management. At the same time there has been a growing recognition that ecosystem management involves coupled, complex socio-ecological systems which are inherently unpredictable due to the non-linear nature of their construction. The diverse social activities and natural processes involved in such an approach requires the inclusion of multiple disciplines which presently have very limited dialogues. It is apparent that there is an urgent need for new, interdisciplinary, methods with which to address management holistically and under conditions of uncertainty. This research aimed to examine the data-policy and theory-practice divides which currently hinder effective implementation of marine management. Key to this was to approach the Irish Sea as an interacting human-marine system, and to explore methodologies appropriate to interdisciplinary research in order to analyse why marine conservation is failing to deliver. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a spatial `footprint' map of human activities in the marine area was developed from an initial survey of available marine data. The Drivers-Pressures- State Changes-Impacts-Response framework extended the scope to cover landbased as well as marine activities, and soft systems methodology was used to include data and knowledge from both the natural and social sciences. The results showed a qualitative dichotomy in the types of data involved, demonstrating how both the data-policy divide and the theory practice divide are constructed and maintained. The pre-eminence of scientific data in informing management decisions explained why conservation initiatives may fail, and why advances in theoretical understanding are so difficult to translate into practice. It also demonstrated some of the dangers of our present reliance on the Drivers, Pressures, State-Changes-Impacts Responses (DPSIR) framework for the development of sustainability indicators, particularly when based on scientific data alone. An ontological reframing of the issues was then suggested, and scenario development was used as a means of overcoming the limitations of disciplinary <b>epistemologies</b> when <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a complex system. It was concluded that, as well as the best available quantitative data, qualitative factors are equally important in management. Feelings, concerns, aspirations and values of individuals and society {{play a crucial role in}} shaping the research agenda and in implementing policy. Sustainability therefore can not be successfully addressed from within the scientific paradigm. Science can provide information, alongside other conflicting information, and subject to an irreducible level of uncertainty, but relying on quantitative, scientific data to solve what is ultimately a social challenge is inadequate. Sustainability needs to be addressed from a much wider paradigmatic basis, employing wisdom as well as knowledge. This implies the need for consciously questioning more deeply what it is we really want from science, for society and for the future. Environmental degradation, of the Irish Sea or any socio-ecological system, is an expression of societal values, which can change, and which we clearly need to change in the light of the present conditions.

In Meno, Socrates' distinction between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as [...] "justified true belief".

According to Kvanvig, true belief is what is necessary to maximize truth and to avoid error, thus dropping justification from the equation of knowledge. He argues that once we recognize what the manipulated boundary notion of non-Gettierized account of knowledge is, then it becomes clear that there is nothing valuable about the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. Kvanvig acknowledges that true belief falls short of knowledge, however to him, true belief is no less valuable than knowledge.
