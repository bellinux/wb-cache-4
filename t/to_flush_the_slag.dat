50|$|Over the years, {{the quality}} of the flood control around the lake has grown, {{resulting}} in damage to the environment.

50|$|Standpipes are not {{fail-safe}} {{systems and}} there have been many instances where fire operations have been compromised by standpipe systems that are damaged or otherwise not working properly.

50|$|With some products, such as cheese, it {{has long}} been common <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> package with {{nitrogen}} prior to sealing: the inert nitrogen is absorbed into the cheese, allowing a tight shrink film package.

50|$|When {{a vessel}} is {{prepared}} {{for use as a}} bypass graft, a standard syringe is typically used <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> vessel and check for leaks. Using uncontrolled pressure <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> or clear <b>the</b> vessel can result in damage to the internal cellular lining of the vessel, known as the endothelium. Limiting the maximum pressure that {{can be applied to the}} vessel may prevent injury and improve the overall quality and long term patency of the graft. Pressure-limiting syringes are available, and they have been clinically shown to protect against overdistension.|$|R

5000|$|There were twenty-three toilets for {{eighteen}} hundred {{people and the}} lines became extremely long in the morning.

50|$|The modern {{water closet}} or toilet utilises a cistern to reserve {{and hold the}} correct amount of water {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> toilet bowl. In earlier toilets, the cistern was located high above the toilet bowl and connected to it by a long pipe. It was necessary to pull a hanging chain connected to a release valve located inside the cistern in order <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> toilet. Modern toilets may be close coupled, with the cistern mounted directly on the toilet bowl and no intermediate pipe. In this arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> mechanism (lever or push button) is usually mounted on the cistern. Concealed cistern toilets, where the cistern {{is built into the}} wall behind the toilet, are also available. A flushing trough is a type of cistern used to serve more than one WC pan at one time. These cisterns are becoming less common however. The cistern was the genesis of the modern bidet.|$|R

Şaziye Erel's first memory of Korhan's deep {{interest}} in sounds was when Korhan as a toddler would make her take him to a bathroom (either their own or their host's bathroom) and there she would have <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> toilet numerous times while Korhan listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> of <b>the</b> water and the refilling of the reservoir. If she stopped before Korhan had heard enough, Korhan would cry and she'd have to continue, during a serious financial crisis in mid-70s Turkey where even water was rationed and sparse.|$|R

This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines. Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.|$|R

40|$|The Blackwood River estuary is {{the largest}} river by flow volume in south west Australia. The estuary is under {{increasing}} pressure from climate change, dryland salinity, tourism and aquifer extractions. This study aimed to determine {{the current state of}} the estuary and the dominant estuarine processes, and to make predictions about the future of the estuary. To fulfill the objectives of the study, field work and hydrodynamic modeling were undertaken. Initial field measurements revealed that bottom waters in the tidal river of the estuary were saline and low in oxygen, most likely due to low rainfall throughout the catchment in the previous six months. The later field measurements were consistent with two storm events throughout the catchment having begun <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> river. Modeling using HAMSOM provided information about the conditions that would completely <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> entire estuary. Previous estimates of the river flow required <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>the</b> estuary were overestimated compared to the model results. High surge was associated with increased salt transport into the estuary as expected. Comparison of the field and model data suggested that the model overestimated tidal lag in the estuary. The dominant process affecting salinity structure in the estuary was streamflow. Tidal strainin...|$|R
