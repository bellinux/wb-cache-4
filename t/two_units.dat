5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 1, spaced <b>two</b> <b>units</b> apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells in state 0, spaced <b>two</b> <b>units</b> apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942.

The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin.

In many cases, it is impossible even for experts to identify different models and years of production.

In January 1793, stationed around Gniezno with <b>two</b> <b>units</b> of cavalry, about 200 strong, he briefly engaged the Prussian forces entering Poland {{in the aftermath of the}} Second Partition of Poland, and afterward became a known activist advocating the continuation of military struggle against the occupiers.|$|E
5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into <b>two</b> <b>units.</b> The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E

Taunton's second largest retail park is Priory Fields Retail Park, located on Priory Avenue. It consists of five units plus an anchor store, Wickes Extra. It was redeveloped in 2003 to modernise the rather worn out appearance of the retail park and also to increase retail floorspace.|$|E
