System analysis and information design principles were adopted during the development processes. Starting from user requirements based on field studies the development of graphic icons and their testing has been outlined. In addition to integrating individual icons into a GUI, coding and loading the application on a mobile phone {{has been done to}} enable testing of the GUI prototype. Users from the construction <b>trade</b> (<b>sample</b> size = 29), randomly selected, were asked to evaluate the designed icons in terms of their acceptance, adaptability and learnability aspects. It was found that learnability of the new GUI was more dependent on age and education level of the user rather than on the length of prior experience they had with mobile phones in general. The length of experience of using mobiles may not be an indicator of learnability in new applications for such user segments due to rapid rise in 'digital literacy' levels amongst semi literate users...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates various {{output gap}} {{measures}} {{in a simple}} inflation forecasting framework. Reflecting the cyclical position of an economy, an (unobservable) output gap {{has important implications for}} economic analysis. I construct and compare common output gap measures for five European countries. Since output above potential reflects domestic inflationary pressures, including a gap could improve the accuracy of autoregressive inflation forecasting. This assertion is tested in a simple simulated out-of-sample forecasting exercise for the period 1990 - 2002. The main conclusions are that an output gap rarely provides useful information and that there is no single best output gap measure across countries.

40|$|In most {{macroeconomic}} models, the substitutability between {{domestic and}} foreign goods is calibrated using aggregated data. This imposes homogeneous elasticities across goods, and the calibration is only valid under this assumption. If elasticities are heterogeneous, the aggregate substitutability is a weighted average of good-specific elasticities, which in general cannot be inferred from aggregated data. We identify structurally the substitutability in US goods using multilateral trade data. We impose homogeneity, and find an aggregate elasticity similar in value to conventional macroeconomic estimates. It {{is more than twice}} larger with sectoral heterogeneity.

40|$|Majority of {{the people}} in Pakistan cannot afford allopathic {{medicines}} and thus rely on traditional system of medicine i. e., Unani system that is mainly plant based. Now a day, on one hand lack of quality control, adulteration, substitution, improper storage, etc. decrease the efficacy of the traditional medicines {{and on the other hand}} there exists a lot of confusion regarding the botanical identity of many Unani drugs. As a result there is considerable difference of opinion as to which one among two or more plant species forms the official drug in Traditional Unani System of Pakistan. In view of the above confusion comparative study of medicinal plant species and market samples were carried out to find out what is the nature of the <b>trade</b> <b>sample.</b> In this regard about eight Unani crude herbal drugs i. e. â€˜Banafshaâ€™, â€˜Gul-e-babunaâ€™, â€˜Gul-e-gaozabanâ€™, â€˜Gul-e-ghafizâ€™, â€˜Gul-e-khairaâ€™, â€˜Samandarsokâ€™, â€˜Shahtraâ€™ and â€˜Zafranâ€™ have been selected. Survey of major seven crude herbal markets was carried out and Price per Kg and source of procurement was investigated. Two samples from each market were subjected to further investigation. With regard to variability Gul-e-babuna was found to be the most adulterated or substituted as along with real â€˜babunaâ€™ (i. e., Matricaria recutita), 4 other species belonging to family Asteraceae were found in the market samples (i. e., Microcephala lamellata, Tripleurospermum disciforme, Parthenium hysterophorus and Pulicaria species). Botanical identification of 3 drugs viz Samandarsok, Gul-e-ghafis and Gul-e-gaozaban was found to be incorrect. Correct identification was made consulting and comparing the descriptions given by Unani text. The correct species identified were Salvia plebeia for Samandarsok instead of Argyreia speciosa, Gentianodes olivieri for Gul-e-ghafis instead of Delphinium zalil and Echium amoenum for Gul-e-gaozaban instead of Onosma bracteatum Wallich. These drugs were found to be homogenous among the rest as no adulterant or substituent was detected. For the drug Banafsha (Viola odorata) and Gul-e-khaira (Althaea officinalis), the identified plant species were not found in the trade, instead other Viola species (i. e., V. canescens, V. kashmeriana, V. pilosa, V. stocksii and V. rupestris) for Banafsha and Alcea rosea (L.) Cav. for Gul-e-khaira were identified. For the drug Gul-e-babuna and Zafran, the original plant species were found along with other adulterant or substituents. It was concluded that today many of the medicinal plants available in the trade have ambiguous identification along with adulteration and contamination. Moreover labels on herbal products do not mention correct plant species, due to the lack of services of taxonomic or botanical expert in the pharmaceutical industries. Therefore for raising Unani system of herbal medicine to global standard, it is very essential that each component or the factor of the system should be critically studied and made perfect. There arises an urgent and ultimate need for standardization, starting from correct identification of plant material, elimination of adulteration and conductance of critical pharmacopoeial & pharmacological research...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a regularized sampling method for multiband signals, {{that makes it}} possible to approach the Landau limit, while keeping the sensitivity to noise at a low level. The method is based on band-limited windowing, followed by trigonometric approximation in consecutive time intervals. The key point is that the trigonometric approximation "inherits" the multiband property, that is, its coefficients are formed by bursts of non-zero elements corresponding to the multiband components. It is shown that this method can be well combined with the recently proposed synchronous multi-rate sampling (SMRS) scheme, given that the resulting linear system is sparse and formed by ones and zeroes. The proposed method allows one to <b>trade</b> <b>sampling</b> efficiency for noise sensitivity, and is specially well suited for bounded signals with unbounded energy like those in communications, navigation, audio systems, etc. Besides, it is also applicable to finite energy signals and periodic band-limited signals (trigonometric polynomials).

40|$|The file {{attached}} to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link. This paper presents evidence from highly disaggregated Chinese firm-product data that, given productivity, input tariff reductions induce an incumbent importer/exporter to increase product markups. We further investigate empirically the mechanisms underlying this trade liberalization effect, and find that input tariff reductions decrease marginal costs, and their effects on markup adjustments are more profound among firms with higher import dependence. Moreover, we exploit unique features of Chinese data by comparing results for two trade regimes: ordinary trade (wherein firms pay import tariffs to import) and processing trade (wherein firms {{are not subject to}} import tariffs). While the aforementioned trade liberalization effects and mechanisms only apply to ordinary <b>trade,</b> processing <b>trade</b> <b>samples</b> are used in a placebo test.

So far, Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) symptoms have been always investigated on soft wheat heads or on seeds collected in the field during harvesting.

Concentrations in the food simulant which exceed 0. 100 +/- 0. 005 mg Cd dm(- 2) and 1. 00 +/- 0. 05 mg Pb dm(- 2) for flat receptacles, 0. 500 +/- 0. 025 mg Cd l(- 1) and 5. 00 +/- 0. 25 mg Pb l(- 1) for low volume (5 l) receptacles are not acceptable and measures were taken by the EU member state authorities to enforce these norm concentrations. Generally, the uncertainty on the results forwarded by the legislation amounts to 5 %. This value does not at all match the pronounced variability observed f or several `identical' <b>trade</b> <b>samples,</b> but rather represents the inherent variability of spectrometric analyses alone. Considering that the coefficients of variation can {{be as high as}} similar to 30 %, either the ranges of acceptable concentrations or the maximal allowable concentrations should be corrected. Aware of the negative health effects of heavy metal contamination and of the risk increase due to dietary intake, a downward adjustment of the acceptable concentration ranges to 0. 07 mg Cd dm(- 2) +/- 12 %, 0. 30 mg Cd l(- 1) +/- 12 % and 0. 10 mg Cd l(- 1) +/- 12 % and to 0. 8 mg Pb dm(- 2) +/- 13 %, 4. 0 mg Pb l(- 1) +/- 13 % and 1. 50 mg Pb l(- 1) +/- 13 % is suggested. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{quantitative}} model is developed to explain differences in average store price levels. We assume that stores may operate under different economic regimes, that is, under excess capacity or excess demand. Prices {{are expected to}} be higher than average in case of an excess demand regime and lower in an excess capacity situation. Actual information regarding the regime that applies to each individual store is not available. Therefore, we propose to use a so-called 'switching model' with endogenous regime choice to analyse the store price differences. The model developed m the paper is estimated using four largely differing types of stores from the Durch retail <b>trade.</b> These <b>samples</b> consist mainly of small stores...|$|R
