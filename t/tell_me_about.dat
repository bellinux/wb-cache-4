He {{instantly}} wrote back: [...] "je n'en aurais peut-être pas voulu recevoir d'autre de vous, malgré ce que vous me dites de triste sur vous et votre santé" [...] ("I could not perhaps {{wish to have}} received any other [...] from you, {{in spite of the}} sad things you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> yourself and your health"). He made plans to visit Dresden in May, and obtain a visa to visit her in Russia.|$|E
500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|P. G. Wodehouse based the {{character}} Psmith, seen {{in several of}} his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas. [...] In the introduction to his novel Something Fresh, Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was [...] "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man. [...] He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'." [...] Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the Wykehamist schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College. Rupert D'Oyly Carte was [...] "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn." [...] Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.|$|E
5000|$|Robin has strange ideas.... My other {{friend and}} {{colleague}} Bryan Caplan put it best: [...] "When the typical economist <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> his latest research, my standard reaction is 'Eh, maybe.' Then I forget about it. When Robin Hanson <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> his latest research, my standard reaction is 'No way! Impossible!' Then I {{think about it for}} years." ...|$|R

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] used to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise {{with the potential for}} hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

And they've all assured me that they don't." [...] Christie said: [...] "The chief of staff and chief counsel assured me they feel comfortable that we have all the information we need to have." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Eddie and the Cruisers was {{discovered}} by additional audiences during its first pay cable run on HBO. Embassy Pictures re-released the film for one week based on successful summer cable screenings and a popular radio single, but it once again failed to perform at the box office. Looking back, Davidson said, [...] "that picture {{should have been a}} theatrical success. There was an audience for it. People still watch it and still <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell, however, {{had little}} luck {{overcoming}} the tremendous antipathy toward Mulroney, despite a substantial bounce from the leadership convention. Chrétien saw an opportunity, and on September 19, released the entire Liberal platform. The 112-page document, Creating Opportunity, quickly {{became known as}} the Red Book because of its bright red cover. It was a very specific and detailed statement of exactly what a Chrétien government would do in office. The Red Book gave the Liberals the reputation as the party with ideas, since none of the other parties had anything comparable. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: [...] "Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!".|$|E
