5|$|In 1994, a {{government}} committee concluded <b>that</b> <b>building</b> more roads encourages more traffic {{and that the}} way to ease congestion and pollution was to take measures to control car use rather than accommodate more.

5|$|In 1754, William Skrimshire {{purchased}} Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, {{and half}} of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. <b>That</b> <b>building</b> is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings {{and size of the}} residence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the house, which has a full basement, the museum uses a separate building as a gallery. <b>That</b> <b>building,</b> the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used for storage and as a shop, but looks similar to the Rice House. This gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of agates, thundereggs, zeolites, and placer gold, among others.|$|E
5|$|Johann Ludwig Schneller {{brought in}} skilled Arab laborers from Bethlehem and Beit Jala to {{construct}} a total of eight buildings, which were constructed in stages and completed in the early 20th century.

5|$|The bishops took {{possession}} of the castle later in 1271 and promised Llywelyn <b>that</b> <b>building</b> work would temporarily cease and that negotiations would begin the following summer. In February of the next year, however, de Clare's men seized back the castle, threw out the bishops' soldiers, and de Clare – protesting his innocence in these events – began work once again. Neither Henry nor Llywelyn could readily intervene and de Clare was able to lay claim to the whole of Glamorgan. Work on the castle continued, with additional water defences, towers and gatehouses added.|$|E
5|$|The {{new site}} was {{completed}} in 1968, and the current high school building opened in 1971. In the 1980s, as school enrollment declined and costs increased, the Grade School building was leased to Pace University and the remaining students in <b>that</b> <b>building</b> (grades six through eight) occupied {{a portion of the}} new High School building. In 1988, a plan for a larger village and school meeting and performance area was initiated. A new auditorium {{was completed in}} 1998. After a bond vote in 2001, the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed in the early 2000s adjoining the high school.|$|E

5|$|The site {{occupied}} by the tower was home to the Palace Hotel, and organised opposition was formed {{to try to save}} <b>that</b> <b>building</b> from demolition to make way for an office tower. The site was subsequently acquired by businessman Alan Bond and the tower was approved and constructed in a plan that would retain much of the Palace Hotel. The tower then remained the headquarters of Bond's companies until their collapse. The tower has also been the headquarters of Western Australia's state bank, Bankwest (formerly known as the R Bank), between its completion and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} burned-out capitol {{building}} remained a pile of stones for several years after the fire. A downtown building, Nesmith's Building (later named the Holman Building), served as a temporary capitol from 1859 until 1876. The legislature met on {{the second and third}} floors of <b>that</b> <b>building,</b> which also housed the other state offices.|$|E
5|$|The tower {{attracted}} {{a number of}} significant tenants, including INMARSAT and the independent radio station Capital Radio. The ITV broadcaster Thames Television's corporate headquarters were nearby at No.306–316 Euston Road from 1971 to 1992 when the station closed. <b>That</b> <b>building</b> was demolished in 1994 and redeveloped when Thames, now a production company, moved all operations to Teddington Studios.|$|E

5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering {{experts from the}} United States spent {{a period of time}} in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed <b>that</b> <b>building</b> inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested <b>that</b> <b>building</b> a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E

5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>building</b> the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction {{became known as the}} East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in <b>that</b> <b>building</b> was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter {{is the only one of}} the village's churches that still functions as a church.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from <b>that</b> <b>building</b> had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
