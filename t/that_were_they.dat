Some of them, such as Sebastián de Belalcázar, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, and Nicolás de Federman, interested in locating El Dorado, discovered the rich plains of Cundinamarca and Boyacá.

Víðarr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods [...] "with hatred." [...] Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being [...] "wary of war" [...] and [...] "shy of shooting." [...] Bragi responds <b>that,</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> outside of Ægir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies.

60|$|The {{door was}} closed to keep out intruders. Dough was made, and a fire kindled with pieces of wood dry as tinder, so that no smoke should attract the eye {{of those who were}} {{constantly}} on the lookout for such a sign that some family were engaged in cooking. The flat dough cakes were placed over the glowing embers, the whole having been divided into twenty-four portions. Some of the men would hardly wait until their portions were baked; but John urged upon them <b>that,</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> to eat it in a half-cooked state, the consequences might be very serious, after their prolonged fast.

This was the {{suggestion}} of Francis, who said <b>that,</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> unarmed, the people might seize them and hand {{them over to the}} Genoese. At the head of this party, which was about fifty strong, Francis marched up through the little town and out into the country. He had really but little fear, either that the Genoese would arrest them on shore, or that the people would interfere with them, for they would not care to risk the anger of Venice by interfering in such a matter. He thought it probable, however, that if his men remained in the town, broils would arise between them and any of the Genoese sailors who might land.|$|E

Moreover, I think that men in their position, having offended, as it were, without hope of pardon, would naturally desire to flock together. There is comfort and encouragement in numbers.

60|$|Here {{he found}} that Silveira, deserted by Romana and beaten by Franceschi, had fallen back to a {{mountain}} immediately behind Chaves. Terence continued his march until he joined him. He found a great tumult going on among his troops; always insubordinate, they were now {{in a state of}} mutiny. Many of the officers openly advocated that they should desist from a struggle in which success was altogether hopeless, and should go over and join the French. The troops, however, not only spurned the advice, but fell upon and killed several of those who offered it, and demanded from Silveira that he should lead them down to defend Chaves. This he refused to do, saying that the fortifications were old and useless, the guns worn out, and <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> to shut themselves up there, they would be surrounded and forced to surrender.|$|E
60|$|So {{confident}} {{were the}} Rebu {{that if the}} Egyptians dug through their walls, or even threw them down by undermining them, they could repel their assault, that they took but little heed to the huts established {{at the foot of}} the wall, except that a strong body of men were stationed behind the walls, half of whom were always to be under arms in readiness to repel the Egyptians should they burrow through. This confidence proved their ruin. The Egyptians were thoroughly accustomed to mining operations, and were fully aware <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> to pierce the wall the Rebu could at once overwhelm the small working parties; they, therefore, after penetrating a considerable distance into the embankment, drove right and left, making an excavation of considerable size, the roof being supported by beams and planks hauled up at night.|$|E
60|$|The {{experiment}} {{had already}} been tried of farming our better conducted convicts to the settlers, and indeed it was the prospect of obtaining such cheap labor {{that had been the}} main inducement to many of the colonists to establish themselves so far from home, instead of going to America.

60|$|But {{still nothing}} was settled about the wedding. Trevelyan's {{condition}} was so uncertain {{that it was}} very difficult to settle anything. Though nothing was said on the subject between Stanbury and Mrs. Trevelyan, and nothing written between Nora and her sister, it could not but be remembered that should Trevelyan die, his widow would require a home with them. They were deterred from choosing a house by this reflection, and were deterred from naming a day also by the consideration <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> to do so, Trevelyan's state might still probably prevent it. But this was arranged, that if Trevelyan lived through the winter, or even if he should not live, their marriage should not be postponed beyond the end of March.

A week later information was obtained from a ship captured while attempting to leave the port, that the Portuguese were seriously thinking of evacuating the place altogether, before the fire-ships <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> <b>they</b> had learned, in course of preparation, should arrive. The admiral despatched the Maria da Gloria to the port to lay in water and victuals for three months. The other ships there were also to be victualled, and the Piranza was directed to join at once. In the meantime Lord Cochrane determined to increase, if possible, the alarm of the Portuguese, though he had now only the flag-ship off the port.|$|E
