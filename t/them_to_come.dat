5|$|These two {{crushing}} military defeats {{forced the}} Galatians {{to sue for}} peace. This campaign greatly enriched Vulso and his legions as the Galatians had gathered great wealth through their many conquests in Asia Minor. The Galatians sent envoys to Vulso asking for peace but Vulso, {{who at the time}} was hurrying back to Ephesus because winter was approaching, bade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{still has}} his lease on the closet he {{used as the}} office space for the Michael Scott Paper Company. Concerned that the office is still tense from the recent {{management}} by Dunder Mifflin vice president Charles Miner, Michael decides to convert the closet into a dance hall called Cafe Disco for his employees to socialize, drink coffee and dance. None of the employees care to join him, much to the disappointment of Michael, who plays music through the ventilation system to try tempting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest {{were already}} playing {{international}} arenas, when new heavy metal bands, composed of very young people, debuted in small venues {{in many cities}} in the UK. The country's larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable. Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a local fan base and enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in contact with managers and record label agents.|$|E

5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets {{the impression that he}} is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E

25|$|A {{previous}} application for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to New Zealand was lodged in late 2006, {{but at that}} time, Immigration Minister David Cunliffe {{said it would not}} be appropriate while the status of Zaoui's security risk certificate was being determined.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby went to Joe Campisi's restaurant. At {{the time of}} the Kennedy assassination, Ruby was close enough to the Campisis to ask <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> see him after he was arrested for {{shooting}} Lee Oswald. Joe Campisi and his wife visited with Jack Ruby in jail for ten minutes on November 30, 1963.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1299, due to {{impending}} invasion from the Egyptian Mamluks, King Hethum II {{sent a message to}} Ghazan to obtain his support. In response, Ghazan marched with his forces towards Syria and sent letters to the Franks of Cyprus (the King of Cyprus, and the heads of the military orders), inviting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> join him in his attack on the Mamluks in Syria.|$|E
25|$|Six of the escapees {{were there}} and we talked for about three hours with me trying to persuade <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back.

25|$|Jean-Claude Fournier succeeded Franquin as {{artist and}} {{writer of the}} Spirou and Fantasio series with Le faiseur d'or, {{published}} in 1969. Kidnapped by gangsters, leading scientist the Count of Champignac is forced by <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with a means of helping them with their plans. Thinking of Gaston, he comes up {{with the kind of}} recipe that the office idiot would devise, but the resulting and disgusting mixture does have the results that the gangsters wanted, much to the Count's annoyance.|$|E

25|$|At 08:00 {{the rebel}} {{officers}}' nominal superior, Maj. Kofuji, {{was told to}} inform the officers of the imperial command and order them {{to return to their}} units. However, Muranaka and Kōda had already heard of the command from Nakahashi. Believing the order to be a mistake, they went to see him. When they met Kofuji he only told <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to 1st Division Headquarters. There they met Gen. Hori, who lied to them, telling them that no command had been issued. The relieved but skeptical officers left.|$|E
25|$|Chiang Kai-shek {{threatened}} the French with war {{in response to}} manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a peace agreement. In February 1946, he also forced the French to surrender and renounce all of their concessions and ports in China, such as Shanghai, in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region starting in March 1946. Following this agreement, VNQDĐ forces became vulnerable due to the withdrawal of Chinese forces and were attacked by Viet Minh and French troops. The Viet Minh massacred thousands of VNQDD members and other nationalists {{in a large scale}} purge.|$|E
25|$|The oligarchies {{opposed the}} Cleomenian reforms. With Cleomenes' quick {{victories}} this opposition increased throughout all the Peloponnese. Cleomenes took Corinth and other strategic places. The Cleomenian reforms, {{although they were}} {{not intended to be}} applied to the defeated populations, was a significant factor behind the campaign successes of the Spartan king. Indeed, some of the Achean population wanted to be debt-free and were willing to share their lands for more equity. In reality, Cleomenes did not care that much about the defeated population and chose to negotiate with the oligarchies even if the enmity between Aratus and Cleomenes was too great to enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an agreement.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the novel, Dolores Umbridge – the school's {{politically}} appointed headmistress – captures Harry and interrogates {{him about}} Dumbledore's whereabouts. She sends for Snape, demanding that he provide the magical truth serum Veritaserum in order to force Harry to reveal any information he may be hiding. Snape claims that his supplies of the serum have been exhausted after Umbridge used the drug to force information about Dumbledore's Army from Cho Chang. It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. Snape then carries Harry's cryptic warning about Sirius' capture to the other Order members, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the rescue in the Department of Mysteries. Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius' death, believing Snape's goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.|$|E
25|$|In November 1978, a {{group of}} New York feminists participated in a {{national}} feminist antipornography conference, organized by Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media (WAVPM) in San Francisco. After the conference, Susan Brownmiller approached WAVPM organizers Laura Lederer and , and encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to New York City to help with anti-pornography organizing there. Lederer decided to stay in San Francisco to edit an anthology based on the conference presentations, but Campbell took up the offer. She arrived in New York on April 1979, with Brownmiller, Adrienne Rich, and Frances Whyatt contributing money to help her cover her living expenses while the organizing work progressed. Dolores Alexander was soon recruited as a fundraiser, and Barbara Mehrhof was hired as an organizer soon thereafter with the money that Alexander was able to raise. Brownmiller soon took an unpaid position as the fourth organizer.|$|E
25|$|By the 980s {{the kings}} of Wessex had a {{powerful}} grip on the coinage of the realm. It is reckoned there were about 300 moneyers, and 60 mints, around the country. Every {{five or six years}} the coinage in circulation would cease to be legal tender and new coins were issued. The system controlling the currency around the country was extremely sophisticated; this enabled the king to raise large sums of money if needed. The ability to raise large sums of money was needed after the battle of Maldon, as Æthelred decided that, rather than fight, he would pay ransom to the Danes in a system known as Danegeld. As part of the ransom, a peace treaty was drawn up that was intended to stop the raids. However, rather than buying the Vikings off, payment of Danegeld only encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back for more.|$|E
