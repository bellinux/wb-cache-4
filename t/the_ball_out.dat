5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of Johnson's hands while {{he was trying to}} score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E
5|$|With tenminutes left until half-time, the Manchester United defence {{effectively}} {{switched off}} and allowed Touré to dribble unopposed to within 15yards of their penalty area before slipping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> wide to Puyol, whose low cross was diverted behind by Vidić. The corner kick was taken short and the eventual cross was headed behind for another corner {{on the opposite}} side by Evra. The second corner was crossed in towards Piqué, but he was unable to make contact with the ball.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>out</b> of {{play when}} an infraction of the Laws of the Game occurs, play is {{restarted}} according to <b>the</b> reason <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> became <b>out</b> of play before the infraction.

50|$|When {{the referee}} blows the whistle during play {{everyone}} must stop {{exactly where they}} are. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>out</b> of bounds on a shot then the player that is closest to <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> receives <b>the</b> possession. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>out</b> of bounds not on a shot then the other team is awarded with the possession. For example, if a player threw a bad pass to her teammate and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> went <b>out</b> of bounds then the other team would receive <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>out</b> of bounds on a shot, {{it is common for}} the player to reach out her stick in an attempt to be ruled closest to <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and gain possession.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>out</b> of play, {{the only}} restart is the restart {{appropriate}} for <b>the</b> reason <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> went <b>out</b> {{of play in}} the first place; subsequent actions do not change the restart. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>out</b> of play because of a foul by Team A against Team B, the restart must be a free kick to Team B even if a Team B player strikes an opponent; offending Team B player would, however, be liable for misconduct (i.e. yellow card or red card).|$|R
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1971, Banks was {{involved}} in a notorious incident with George Best who, while playing against England for Northern Ireland, flicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of Banks' hands and headed it into the net. The move was audacious, but was disallowed by the referee, who judged it to be dangerous play. Banks played his 73rd and final game for England on 27 May 1972, in a 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. During his 73 international games he kept 35 clean sheets and lost just nine games.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October, Nani {{scored a}} {{controversial}} second goal as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 at home. He scored {{into an empty}} net after Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes rolled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> to take a free-kick he thought had been given for handball; however, play was allowed to go on as referee Mark Clattenburg did not blow his whistle. On 27 November, Nani scored United's fifth goal in a 7–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Nani netted his first goal of 2011 as he scored the winning strike in a 2–1 home victory over Stoke City on 4 January.|$|E
50|$|Green Bay won {{the coin}} toss and got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> first. But two plays into their drive, Cardinals {{defensive}} back Michael Adams sacked Rodgers {{as he was}} about to throw. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> came <b>out</b> of Rodgers hands, and a desperate Rodgers tried to kick <b>the</b> loose <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of bounds, but it got away and went into the arms of Dansby, who returned the fumble 17 yards for a touchdown to win the game.|$|R

5|$|On {{the first}} play from {{scrimmage}} in the third quarter, Garcia threw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> {{of the end zone}} for a safety following a bad snap. After the free kick, Alabama scored on a 39-yard Shelley field goal, to make the score 21–14. After a one-yard Lattimore touchdown run, Alabama answered with a 51-yard Darius Hanks touchdown reception from McElroy, to make the score 28–21. However, Lattimore scored on a two-yard touchdown run late in the fourth to give the Gamecocks a 35–21 victory. The win marked South Carolina's first all-time victory over a team ranked number one in the AP poll.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} closely fought and was finally {{declared}} a scoreless tie by the referee {{about an hour}} after it began. Navy reportedly never gained possession of the ball. However, the Naval Academy managed to keep the Baltimore Athletic Club from ever being in a scoring position. On three separate occasions, Navy forced Baltimore back into its own end zone for a safety; these were not worth any points until 1882, however, so they offered Navy no benefit. The American and Chronicle reported that Maxwell, Craven, and Sample of Navy gave the strongest performances, but were also reckless in their play and were repeatedly penalized for jumping offside or kicking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of play, a form of delay of game.|$|E
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E

25|$|Recently, an exact-scale HO {{model of}} the AAR coupler has been {{designed}} and manufactured by Frank Sergent.

5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds of injury time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E
5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E

5|$|Canadian football, the {{predominant}} form of football in Canada, {{is closely related}} to American football – both sports developed from rugby, and the two sports are considered to be the chief variants of gridiron football. Although the two games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures , including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards), teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of the defense's end zone. The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind only the National Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot {{the ball into the}} net past Coupet.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he was {{involved}} in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong's Steven King. As King attempted to kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of mid-air, he missed and collected White's face {{at the height of his}} leg's swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14screws into White's jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne's final match of the season—Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did not miss a match, despite the severity of the injury. White's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of the glove of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way to first base. Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in riot gear took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct call when they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series crew chief.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone.

Instead, Frey carried <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>out</b> of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E
