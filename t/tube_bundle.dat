25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b> They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b> Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

A set of tubes is called the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> and can be made up of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube {{heat exchangers}} are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260°C). This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers: ...|$|E

They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be sufficient liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through the shell side. There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|E

50|$|The second {{description}} of the flow field state within the pipe is the turbulence intensity. According to an experiment in 1994, the metering errors may exist even when the velocity flow profile is fully developed with perfect pipe flow conditions. Conversely, it was found zero metering error at times when the velocity profile was not fully developed. Hence this behavior was referred to the turbulence intensity of the gas flow that can cause metering bias error. This behavior accounts in part for the less than adequate performance of the conventional <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} {{consist of a}} <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> which is placed inside the larger shell. Due to this design these exchanger require twice the footprint of the heat exchanger in order to perform maintenance. Depending {{on the amount of}} cooling needed, shell and tube {{heat exchangers}} can be built in single or double pass configuration. The number of pass refers to the number of times the fluid in the shell passes by the fluid in the tubes. This is achieved by placing baffles in the shell that allow for the fluid to be directed.|$|E

40|$|Flow visualization, heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop characteristics in flow through staggered <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> have {{been regarded as}} classical, with results well-documented. However, the mechanism of producing such results has been left untouched. Applications of staggered <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> are abundant in industry, for example as heat exchange devices like the shell-and-tube type and fuel bundles in nuclear reactor cores. An experimental study is recorded in the present paper which investigates the interaction of von Karman vortices and intersecting main streams in staggered <b>tube</b> <b>bundles.</b> Flow visualization {{by means of the}} particle tracing method, laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and pressure drop measurements using a piezometer are conducted. A modified Reynolds number appropriate to flow through a staggered tube arrangement is defined together with a pressure drop coefficient. Auto-correlation and power spectrum analyses of signals obtained from LDV measurements yield an optimum spectrum frequency which is correlated against the Reynolds number. It is concluded that flow characteristics in staggered <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> are determined by the interaction between the von Karman vortex street and X-shaped interacting main streams...|$|R

50|$|A {{shell and}} tube heat {{exchanger}} is a class of heat exchanger designs. It {{is the most common}} type of heat exchanger in oil refineries and other large chemical processes, and is suited for higher-pressure applications. As its name implies, this type of heat exchanger consists of a shell (a large pressure vessel) with a bundle of tubes inside it. One fluid runs through the tubes, and another fluid flows over the tubes (through the shell) to transfer heat between the two fluids. The set of tubes is called a <b>tube</b> <b>bundle,</b> and may be composed of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc.|$|E
50|$|Absorber : As the {{refrigerant}} vapor migrates to the absorber {{from the}} evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed {{over the top}} of the absorber <b>tube</b> <b>bundle.</b> The strong lithium bromide solution actually pulls the refrigerant vapor into solution, creating the extreme vacuum in the evaporator. The absorption of the refrigerant vapor into the lithium bromide solution also generates heat which is removed by the cooling water. Now the dilute lithium bromide solution collects in the bottom of the lower shell, where it flows down to the solution pump. The chilling cycle is now completed and the process begins once again.|$|E
50|$|The simple {{design of}} a shell and tube heat {{exchanger}} makes it an ideal cooling solution {{for a wide variety}} of applications. One of the most common applications is the cooling of hydraulic fluid and oil in engines, transmissions and hydraulic power packs. With the right choice of materials they can also be used to cool or heat other mediums, such as swimming pool water or charge air. One of the big advantages of using a shell and tube heat exchanger is that they are often easy to service, particularly with models where a floating <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> (where the tube plates are not welded to the outer shell) is available.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the Rainhill {{trials of}} 1829 Henry Booth, {{treasurer}} of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway suggested to George Stephenson, a scheme for a multi-tube one-pass horizontal boiler made up of two units: a firebox surrounded by water spaces and a boiler barrel consisting of two telescopic rings inside which were mounted 25 copper tubes; the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> occupied much of the water space in the barrel and vastly improved heat transfer. Old George immediately communicated the scheme to his son Robert {{and this was the}} boiler used on Stephenson's Rocket, outright winner of the trial. The design formed the basis for all subsequent Stephensonian-built locomotives, being immediately taken up by other constructors; this pattern of fire-tube boiler has been built ever since.|$|E

The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E
