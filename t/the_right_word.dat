[...] A writer for International Business Times adds that Cooper, despite being in his 40s, has a [...] "boyish charm and laid-back personality."

500|$|Steiger {{was offered}} the title role in Patton (1970), but turned it down {{because he did not}} want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his [...] "dumbest career move", remarking, [...] "I got on my high horse. I thought I was a pacifist." [...] Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte {{opposite}} Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: [...] "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word,</b> with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," [...] while literary critic Daniel S.

The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of Jackson's sixth studio album The Velvet Rope, the singer reportedly suffered from depression, which became a central theme to the album among other subjects including domestic abuse, low self-esteem, sadomasochism, homophobia and sexual orientation. In his review of the album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed, [...] " [...] even makes a bid for gay icon status, delivering a diva-ish performance reminiscent of Diana Ross on 'Together Again' (a post-Aids pop song), singing a paean to homosexuality on the jazzy 'Free Xone' and climaxing (if that's <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word)</b> with a bizarre lesbian reinterpretation of Rod Stewart's 'Tonight's the Night'." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] dealt specifically with homophobia and same-sex relationships. Speculation over Jackson's own sexual orientation began circulating {{after the release of}} The Velvet Rope—particularly regarding her cover version of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)"—however, Jackson denied rumors that she has had sexual relationships with other women.|$|E

Leng recognises Barham's arrangements on [...] "pivotal" [...] songs such as [...] "Isn't It a Pity", [...] "My Sweet Lord", [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] and [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] as important elements of the album's sound, while Spector has praised Harrison's guitar and vocal work on the overdubs, saying: [...] "Perfectionist is not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> Anyone can be a perfectionist. He was beyond that..." [...] Harrison's style of slide guitar playing incorporated aspects of both Indian music and the blues tradition; from its introduction on All Things Must Pass, Leng writes, Harrison's slide guitar became his musical signature – [...] "as instantly recognisable as Dylan's harmonica or Stevie Wonder's".|$|E

2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible. Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking feeling when you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word.</b> But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended.

[...] Taran Adarsh commented, [...] "Shahid delivers his career-best performance in Jab We Met... Kareena is in top form as well. Jab We Met is a turning point in her career [...] Fantabulous -- that's <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>word</b> to describe her work this time. The confidence with which she handles the contrasting characterization speaks volumes. This film should do for her what Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) did for Kajol." [...] Subhash K.

[...] The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars concluding, [...] "The film belongs to Shahid and Kareena who pitch in memorable performances and lend a whole new meaning to the boy-meets-girl story." [...] Joginder Tuteja from indiaglitz.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, described it as [...] "Shahid-Kareena's DDLJ", and concluded that [...] "...it would be a pain if any of the two actors do not get awarded and rewarded for their performances..." ...|$|E
