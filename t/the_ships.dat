5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> as soon as <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> would then find their way into the war.|$|E

5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have {{to cut through the}} riot of organic growth that has totally filled <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|Charles Martel was {{the first}} member of a group of five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. Design specifications were identical for each of <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> but different engineers designed each vessel. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Odin and Ägir {{used the}} same {{transverse}} and longitudinal steel frame construction as the Siegfried-class ships. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom for about 60% {{of the length of}} the hull. As in the Siegfrieds, a ninth watertight compartment was added when <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> were lengthened. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a crew of 20officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6officers and 22men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9officers and 34men. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were responsive and had a tight turning radius at low speed, but at hard rudder of 12degrees, <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> lost up to 70percent speed. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace (later removed), two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{approached}} Cuba, it {{had several}} encounters with NATO forces. U.S. submarines were spotted floating {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> {{in an attempt to}} provoke a collision, or to send <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> off course. Additionally, several U.S. Navy airplanes repeatedly flew close over <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> sometimes coming close to crashing into <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> superstructure.|$|R
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> {{to be good}} sea boats, with {{a slight}} roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ships</b> used {{transverse}} and longitudinal steel frames in the hull. They {{had eight}} watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60% of the hull. After the refits, one more watertight compartment was added. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> {{were described as}} good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6 officers and 22 men when serving as a flagship.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ships</b> were {{regarded}} in the German Navy as excellent sea boats {{with an easy}} roll; <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> rolled up to 30° with a period of 10seconds. They maneuvered easily; at hard rudder <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> lost up to 60percent speed and heeled over 9°. However, they suffered from severe vibration, particularly at the stern, at high speeds. They also had very wet bows, even in moderate seas. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a crew of 33 officers and 650 enlisted men. However, when serving as a squadron flagship, the crew was augmented by an additional 13 officers and 66 enlisted men. While acting as a second command ship, 9 officers and 44 enlisted men {{were added to the}} standard crew.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ships</b> {{were very}} stable, {{primarily}} because of their wide beam. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder hard over at high speed. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men.

5|$|After {{undergoing}} a refit {{in the early}} months of the war, Provence conducted anti-raider patrols with Force Y, based in Casablanca. Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax and returned with another convoy loaded with aircraft for the French Air Force. She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X, to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet. Two weeks later, Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte, to join the Force de Raid with Provence. <b>The</b> <b>ships</b> put in at Mers-el-Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> of the French Navy from falling {{into the hands of the}} occupying Germans, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the neutralization of all French warships. Force H was to deliver an ultimatum to <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> based at Mers-el-Kébir; on 3 July, the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk.|$|E
