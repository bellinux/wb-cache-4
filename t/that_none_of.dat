Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated that Lie had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.|$|E
