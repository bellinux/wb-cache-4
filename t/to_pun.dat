When listening to semantic jokes, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus was again activated, and so were the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Interestingly, brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness which the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may be stemming from the mood or emotional change which occurs after hearing humor.|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are; to find out kinds of wordplay found in the film Bring It On, to describe translation techniques used to translate the wordplay, and to describe the impact of translation techniques used to the accuracy, acceptability, and readability of the translation. This study is a descriptive qualitative research, which means that the researcher does not propose a hypothesis and the data {{is in the form of}} qualitative data. The study uses inductive analysis and case study research. All 64 data are wordplay taken from the film Bring It On. This study uses questionnaire to assess the accuracy and acceptability. Observation and interview are used to assess the readability. The analysis result shows that there are seven kinds of wordplay found, namely paronymy (28 data), initialism (13 data), nicknaming (8 data), homonymy (7 data), malapropism (4 data), polysemy (3 data), and portmanteau (1 datum). The translation techniques analysis result presents that there are five techniques used, i. e. pun translated <b>to</b> <b>pun</b> (4 data), pun translated to non pun (38 data), pun translated to zero pun (1 datum), pun in ST is similar <b>to</b> <b>pun</b> in TT (20 data), and editorial technique (1 datum). From the thourough translation quality assessment, it can be concluded that most of the translation is accurate.

40|$|Capsaicinoids are {{valuable}} plant secondary metabolites, arguably among the world's most widely consumed products {{of a plant}} secondary metabolic pathway. Their distribution is restricted to the genus Capsicum (family Solanaceae). Studies documenting the inheritance of pungency have revealed that mutations at a single locus, Pun 1, are responsible for loss of pungency in cultivars of the species C. annuum and C. chinense. This study presents the identification of a previously unreported null allele of Pun 1 from a non-pungent accession of C. frutescens, the third species in the annuum-chinense-frutescens complex. The loss of pungency phenotype in C. frutescens maps <b>to</b> <b>Pun</b> 1 and co-segregates with a molecular marker developed to detect this allele of Pun 1, pun 13. While this mutation is allelic <b>to</b> <b>pun</b> 1 and pun 12, the mutation causing loss of pungency in the undomesticated C. chacoense, pun 2, is not allelic to the Pun 1 locus as demonstrated by mapping and complementation studies. Pun 1 encodes AT 3, an acyltransferase belonging to the BAHD family of acyltransferases. Sequence from the coding region of AT 3 shows {{a high level of}} conservation throughout Solanaceae. A tandem duplication of this gene, designated AT 3 - 1 and AT 3 - 2 respectively, predates the diversification of the Solanaceae. The AT 3 - 2 locus, now a pseudogene, retains regions of amino acid conservation relative to AT 3 - 1. Both Bayesian and maximum parsimony methods demonstrate that the paralogous gene lineages AT 3 - 1 and AT 3 - 2 form well supported phylogenetic clades. We find support for the species complex comprising C. annuum, C. chinense and C. frutescens, widely reported in the literature and which includes Lycianthes. Additionally, in C. rhomboideum, a recombination event has occurred between AT 3 - 1 and AT 3 - 2. In this species, a deletion in AT 3 - 1 eliminates the highly conserved motif DFGWG and is correlated with non-pungency. Finally, this study finds that AT 3 - 1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) suggesting that AT 3 - 1 is not capsaicinoid synthase and that the DFGWG motif may be important for this localization. Treatment with Latrunculin A disrupts AT 3 - 1 localization providing further evidence that it associates with the ER. This analysis sheds light on the putative role of AT 3 - 1 in this intriguing plant biosynthetic pathway...|$|E

40|$|Pungency or heat in Capsicum spp. {{is due to}} the {{accumulation}} of unique secondary compounds known as capsaicinoids in their placental tissues. Detecting presence or absence of pungency at the nursery stage is a challenging task in CMS based hybrid pepper breeding programs. In this study a DNA sequence possibly related to pungency trait with high similarity <b>to</b> <b>Pun</b> 1 or At 3 gene was investigated. Nucleotide alignment of the obtained sequences and corresponding fragment from the data base has revealed a 16 bp deletion in C. annuum ‘Maor’. A multiplex agarose based co-dominant marker was designed to detect the identified polymorphism and named it as Cen 1. This Cen 1 marker is validated in a panel of 27 pepper genotypes belonging to C. annuum, C. chinensis, C. frutescens and C. baccatum for its wide utility. All these Capsicum accessions were correctly discriminated with phenotype. In addition, the ability of Cen 1 marker to discriminate homozygous and heterozygous plants was demonstrated in F 1 hybrids crossed from a non pungent ‘Maor’ and a pungent ‘Habanero’. The Cen 1 marker was also associated with phenotypic character in the tested genotypes. Moreover the linkage association of Cen 1 with At 3 or Pun 1 gene has also been discussed. Therefore the developed functional marker in this study will be highly useful in marker assisted selection (MAS) programmes, germplasam characterization and seed purity testing of chill...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} Translation Strategies of Pun Expressing Humor Used in Deadpool Comics Series By Daniel Way. This study aims at analyzing the strategies {{used by the}} translator in the translation of Deadpool Comics Series By Daniel Way. The researcher used descriptive qualitative {{to analyze the data}} and used frameworks of pun expressing humor by Delabastita (1996) and translation strategies of pun by Delabastita (1993). Based on the analysis, the researcher found the most used category of pun expressing humor in the data is Homonymy with 38 (82. 4 %) words and phrases, followed by Homophony with 4 (8. 8 %) words and phrases, Homography with 2 (4. 4 %) words and phrases, and Paronymy with 2 (4. 4 %) words and phrases. The most used translation strategies is Pun to punoid strategy with 20 (43. 5 %) data, followed by Pun to non-pun with 8 (17. 4 %) data, Pun to non-pun under sub category diffuse paraphrase with 6 (13 %) data, Direct copy with 5 (10. 2 %) data, Pun <b>to</b> <b>pun</b> with 3 (6. 5 %) data, Editorial technique with 2 (4. 4 %) data, Transference with 1 (2. 2 %) data, and Pun to non-pun under sub category selective non-pun with 1 (2. 2). It can be concluded that pun expressing humor used Deadpool Comics Series By Daniel Way describes the words and phrases of pun which have second or more meaning for making humor effect. The strategy used the most is Pun to punoid strategy because the translator perceived the original pun and tried to recreate its effect by using some other wordplay-related rhetorical devices, such as repetition, assonance, irony allusion, and mocking...|$|E
40|$|At {{the heart}} of a nuclear reactor resides its fuel. The {{chemical}} composition of the nuclear fuel affects the performance of several key properties important for the overall operation and safety performance of the reactor. The energy-producing reactors presently operational in the world utilize oxide-based nuclear fuel, which has been the dominating fuel form throughout the history of commercial nuclear power. The concept of nitride-based nuclear fuel is not new and development in the field, together with studies on actinide nitride properties, has been conducted for 50 - 60 years, although in limited scale compared to oxides. Nitride-based nuclear fuel possess properties making it an interesting fuel form in light water reactors as well as liquid metal cooled reactors envisioned for fourth generation nuclear power systems. In generation four reactor systems nitride-based fuel is an interesting fuel option both in UN-based liquid metal cooled breeding reactors as well as in reactors dedicated to the burning of transuranic actinides present in the used fuel of current light water reactors. This thesis focuses on the studies of inert matrix fuels mainly for non-breeding reactor purposes. In this work preparation and characterization of nitride fuel matrices of ZrN, ZrPuN and PuN have been studied. The internal gelation method has been applied for formation of oxide microsphere precursor material and carbothermal reduction has been applied for nitride production. Nitride fuel pellet purity and final density have been studied through cold pressing and sintering as well as ZrCN pellet formation from microspheres through spark plasma sintering. Investigations of nitride purity estimations through powder X-ray diffraction data has been performed. Am losses during the production route of PuN pellets by both internal gelation and powder synthesis has been investigated. Production of reasonably pure PuN through carbothermal reduction is possible and purities up <b>to</b> <b>PuN</b> 0. 99 C 0. 01 have been reached. Carbide formed in ZrN was more stable and in the Zr system nitride purities of about ZrN 0. 85 C 0. 15 were achieved. Conventional pressing and sintering of ZrCN microspheres did not reach densities above about 50 % of theoretical density while spark plasma sintering of ZrCN of similar purity reached about 85 % TD. PuN powder could be conventionally pressed and sintered to almost 80 % of TD. It has been shown that ZrCN materials can be accurately composition estimated by XRD data while quaternary (Zr,Pu) (C,N) material estimations overestimated nitride purity somewhat. During PuN synthesis about 4 % Am was lost during carbothermal reduction. Sintering in N 2 atmosphere resulted in total losses of about 11 % Am while sintering in Ar atmosphere yielded losses of about 50 % Am...|$|E
