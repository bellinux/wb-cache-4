50|$|<b>Television</b> <b>{{guidance}}</b> (TGM) {{is a type}} {{of missile}} guidance system using a television camera in the missile or glide bomb that sends its signal back to the launch platform. There, a weapons officer or bomb aimer watches the image on a television screen and sends corrections to the missile, typically over a radio control link. <b>Television</b> <b>guidance</b> is not a seeker because it is not automated, although semi-automated systems with autopilots to smooth out the motion are known. They {{should not be confused with}} contrast seekers, which also use a television camera but are true automated seeker systems.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{testing of}} the weapon began in 1975. The GBU-15 with <b>television</b> <b>guidance,</b> {{completed}} full-scale operational test and evaluation in November 1983. In February 1985, initial operational test and evaluation was completed on the imaging infrared guidance seeker.|$|E

50|$|As {{the imaging}} {{infrared}} seeker {{and the television}} seeker are significantly smaller than the radar seeker, the manufacturer has {{taken advantage of the}} extra space to develop a variety of combined seekers for dual guidance, which include: radar and imaging infrared <b>guidance,</b> <b>television</b> and imaging infrared guidance, dual band (infrared and imaging infrared) <b>guidance,</b> and <b>television</b> and infrared <b>guidance.</b> These combined seekers can also be fitted at naval bases. The manufacturer says that as of the last quarter of 2006 no orders had been received for any of the combined seekers except the radar and infrared guidance, due to funding problems.|$|R
50|$|The KAB-500KR is {{analogous}} to the American GBU-15 weapon. It uses a standard Soviet/Russian FAB-500 general-purpose bomb, with a nominal weight of 500 kg (1,102 lb), as a warhead, adding a low-light <b>television</b> seeker and <b>guidance</b> fins {{to turn it into a}} guided, unpowered glide bomb.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the U.S. Navy {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a long-range high-precision air-to-surface missile. The missile, named the AGM-53A Condor, was to use a <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system with a data link to the launching aircraft similar to {{the system of the}} then projected AGM-62 Walleye.|$|E
50|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, {{the system}} would use a television only while the missile {{was still on the}} aircraft, and would automatically seek once launched. However, this quickly proved infeasible, as {{the system would}} often break lock {{for a wide variety of}} reasons. This led to the addition of a data link that sent the image back to the aircraft, allowing guidance throughout. This was not a true <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system in the classic sense, as the operator's task was to continue selecting points of high contrast which the seeker would then follow. In practice, however, the updating was almost continuous, and the system acted more like a <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system and autopilot, like the early plans for the Hs 293.|$|E
50|$|Target {{coordinates}} are {{fed into}} the missile before launch, and the initial flight phase is conducted under inertial guidance. At a distance of 10 km from the target the <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system is activated. An operator aboard the aircraft visually identifies the target and locks the missile onto it.|$|E

50|$|From 1929, Tihanyi {{worked on}} <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> for defense applications, {{building}} prototypes {{of a camera}} for remotely guided aircraft in London for the British Air Ministry, and later adapting it for the Italian Navy. In 1929, he invented the first infrared-sensitive (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Television</b> <b>guidance</b> {{was never}} widely used, as the {{introduction}} of laser guided bombs and GPS weapons have generally replaced them. However, they remain useful when certain approaches or additional accuracy are needed. One famous use was {{the attack on the}} Sea Island oil platform during the Gulf War, which required pinpoint accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|Contrast seekers {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> systems, in which a live television signal is broadcast to the launch platform, which then uses manual direction to attack the target. Examples of TV guidance include the Martel and AGM-62 Walleye. The term [...] "contrast contour" [...] is sometimes used, but this may be confused with TERCOM systens.|$|E

50|$|The Walleye was {{the first}} of a family of precision-guided munitions {{designed}} to hit targets with minimal collateral damage. This “smart bomb” had no propulsion system, but it could be maneuvered via a <b>television</b> assisted <b>guidance</b> system during its glide from an aircraft to the target. As a pilot dove towards a target, a television camera in the nose of the bomb transmitted images to a monitor in the cockpit. Once the pilot acquired a sharp image of the target on his screen, he designated an aim point and released the bomb, which would continue flying toward the designated target on its own. The bomb was a true fire-and-forget system because once launched, the plane could immediately turn away from the aim point. The Walleye maneuvered itself using four large fins. Later versions employed an extended range data link that let pilots keep flying the weapon after its release, and even change aim points during flight (command guidance).|$|R
50|$|At {{the first}} film indaba in August 2005, representatives of the South African film and <b>television</b> industry, with <b>guidance</b> from the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF), set to {{establish}} an annual awards ceremony.

Since the inaugural ceremony, the awards have been under the custodianship of the NFVF and governed by a committee. The current NFVF chief-executive officer is the chairperson, {{while the rest of the}} body consists of the national broadcasters, the South African Screen Federation (SASFED), Writers' Guild of South Africa (WGSA), and other key stakeholders.|$|R
50|$|The {{guidance}} section {{is attached to}} the nose of the weapon and contains either a <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system for daytime or an imaging infrared system for night or limited, adverse weather operations. A data link in the tail section sends guidance updates to the control aircraft that enables the weapon systems operator to guide the bomb by remote control to its target.|$|E

50|$|The Germans also {{experimented with}} <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> systems on the Hs 293D models. The use was {{problematic}} - as the bomb approaches the target, even tiny amounts of control input {{would cause the}} target to jump around the TV display, {{so much of the}} difficulty was in developing control systems that would become progressively less sensitive as the pilot required. A wire-guided version was also developed, but this Hs 293B variant was never deployed.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the radar altimeter and television in the early 1940s made remotely guided bomb- or torpedo-carrying aircraft a practical proposition. In January 1942, the Naval Aircraft Factory was instructed to initiate the {{development of}} such an aircraft, with a go-ahead for prototype construction being given in February. A production contract for 100 aircraft was issued in March, with John S. Kean being assigned as TDN-1 project manager, with the aircraft being designed {{to be capable of}} using either <b>television</b> or radar <b>guidance.</b> Constructed mainly from wood, the TDN-1 had a fixed tricycle landing gear, and could be fitted with a conventional cockpit in place of its guidance equipment for test flights.|$|R
40|$|Research {{was carried}} out to {{investigate}} the needs of expectant fathers and to determine whether television can be implemented to provide parent guidance to South African expectant fathers during the transition into fatherhood. Focus was on understanding the specific type of information required by expectant fathers, in conjunction with {{their perceptions of the}} most suitable form of media to provide such guidance. Sixty-five fathers were involved in a telephone survey, after which in-depth interviews were conducted with four fathers to establish their perceptions regarding the possible use of <b>television</b> to provide <b>guidance</b> to expectant fathers. It seems that expectant fathers experience a need for information to help prepare them for their role as a father, require more knowledge regarding the topic of fatherhood and pregnancy, wish to receive guidance to develop certain basic childcare skills, and perceive television to be the most suitable medium for providing them with such guidance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on how {{technology}} is employed as educational support media in distance education. The aim is to establish the availability and accessibility of interac¬tive <b>television</b> for both <b>guidance</b> teachers and students in rural, remote and previously disadvantaged communities. Interactive television {{could be used to}} support the primary modes of education, namely, contact education on campus or at remote sites, paper-¬based distance education and Web-based distance education for in-service education and training of guidance teachers. The TELETUKS schools project is cursorily pre¬sented {{as an example of a}} technology-enhanced delivery system to facilitate interactive television learning. The ITV has the potential to be cost-effective, saving on travelling costs and reaching for increased numbers of upgrading guidance teachers per unit time.

50|$|This {{meant that}} the missile {{would have to be}} fired blind, while the aircraft's own radar was unable to see the target. At the time there was no {{indigenous}} active radar seeker available so {{the decision was made to}} use <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> and data link system to send the video to the launch aircraft. The Martel airframe was considered suitable, and a new nose section with the electronics was added to create the AJ.168 version.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most modern}} {{versions}} of the Maverick are the AGM-65H/K, which were in production [...] The AGM-65H was developed by coupling the AGM-65B with a charge-coupled device (CCD) seeker optimized for desert operations and which has three times {{the range of the}} original TV-sensor; a parallel USN program aimed at rebuilding AGM-65Fs with newer CCD seekers resulted in the AGM-65J. The AGM-65K, meanwhile, was developed by replacing the AGM-65G's IR guidance system with an electro-optical <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the initial}} {{contract}} awarded by the Navy {{called for the}} production of 100 LBP-1 Glombs, continued trials of the concept indicated that the glider's inherent low performance, combined with technical issues with the <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system, made the concept operationally unworkable. As a result, the LBP-1 production contract was reduced to only 35 aircraft in early 1945. In June of that year, the LBP-1 program was terminated, the aircraft having been determined to have dangerous characteristics when attempting landing at loaded weights.|$|E

5000|$|Rajamouli started {{directing}} Telugu {{soap operas}} on Eenadu <b>Television,</b> under the <b>guidance</b> of K. Raghavendra Rao. His first shot at Telugu films was Student No.1 with Jr. NTR {{which was a}} big hit in 2001. It took two long years for Rajamouli {{to come up with}} his second movie and delivered a blockbuster with his second movie Simhadri. In the two-year gap between Student No.1 and Simhadri, Rajamouli planned his first mythological film with Malayalam superstar Mohanlal, but the film eventually got shelved. In 2015, Assistant art director Manu Jagath, who later worked as the art director for Baahubali, released several sketches he had drawn for the shelved Mohanlal project. Rajamouli's third movie was Sye with actors Nithin and Genelia D'Souza [...] It was a first-of-its-kind movie in Tollywood, in that it was based on a rugby game. This movie was also the first instance where Rajamouli collaborated with K. K. Senthil Kumar. With his next flick Chatrapathi, Rajamouli again evoked emotions with the audience. The music of M. M. Keeravani and cinematography by Senthil Kumar added to the film's success.|$|R

50|$|The anti-ship {{version of}} the Martel missile entered service with the RAF in October 1972 and the Royal Navy one year later. These {{missiles}} were designed around a <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> system using a camera in {{the nose of the}} missile that sent its image back to the launch aircraft via a data link radio system. The weapon officer in the aircraft, normally the Blackburn Buccaneer, used the image to guide the missile via signals sent back to the missile on the same data link. This method of operation had been chosen for its simplicity; in comparison, an active radar seeker would be prone to all sorts of countermeasures, including chaff and active jamming systems, and would require some form of navigation system for the approach while the missile was still under the radar horizon.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundA new {{diagnostic}} procedure {{has been established}} for the selection of appropriate therapy for small lung lesions. We compared the sensitivity of real-time multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and X-ray <b>television</b> (TV) fluoroscopic <b>guidance</b> for performing bronchoscopy. MethodsThe first author performed and interpreted all bronchoscopies described in this study. The diagnosis of malignancy or benign {{was based on the}} results of histopathological examination, as well as clinical and imaging follow-up MSCT. We also compared the diagnostic yields of lesion size between MSCT and X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance. ResultsReal-time MSCT and X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance was conducted in 82 and 78 patients, respectively. The lesion size detected by real-time MSCT and X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance was 26 mm (n= 9, 26). The sensitivity of real-time MSCT- and X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance was 62. 2 % and 52. 6 %, respectively. The sensitivity of real-time MSCT fluoroscopic guidance for histopathologic diagnosis of lesions less than 15 mm was higher than that of X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance. While it was difficult to histopathologically diagnose small lung lesions less than 10 mm in diameter, real-time MSCT fluoroscopic guidance offers a better chance of such diagnosis, irrespective of the size of the lesion, compared with X-ray TV fluoroscopic guidance. ConclusionReal-time MSCT fluoroscopic guidance allows the bronchoscopist to accurately determine the location of the instruments in relation to the lesion in real time, thus helping to reduce the number of negative cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} the use of <b>television</b> for providing <b>guidance</b> to expectant fathers by determining whether or not the medium of television can be implemented to offer parent guidance to expectant fathers during the transition into fatherhood. Focus was therefore placed on gaining an understanding of the specific type of information required by expectant fathers, in conjunction with their perceptions of the most suitable form of media to provide such guidance. The study was conducted in terms of an INTERPRETIVIST-positivist paradigm and followed a mixed methods approach. A combination of a survey design and case study research design was employed. Both quantitative and qualitative data collection strategies were implemented during the two phases. Firstly, a telephone survey (questionnaire) was conducted with 65 participants. Secondly, four individual (face-to-face) interviews were conducted with expectant fathers, to obtain in-depth information. In addition, data was collected by means of field notes and a reflective journal. Based on the findings of the study, it is concluded that expectant fathers have a clear need for information to help prepare them for their role as a father and require more knowledge regarding the topic of fatherhood and pregnancy. According to the findings expectant fathers also wish to receive guidance in order for them to develop certain basic childcare skills needed to fulfil their role and regard television to be the most suitable medium for providing them with the guidance they require. Fathers feel that television may assist them by providing the information they require, thereby directly addressing their needs.

5000|$|US {{interest}} in <b>television</b> <b>guidance</b> essentially {{ended in the}} post-war period. Nevertheless, small scale development continued, and a team at the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) developed a way to automatically track light or dark spots on a television image, a concept today known as an optical contrast seeker. Early use of the AGM-12 Bullpup demonstrated that the [...] "silver bullet" [...] was too difficult to use and exposed the launch aircraft to anti-aircraft fire, {{and the need for}} a fire-and-forget weapon became clear. In January 1963, NOTS released a contact for a bomb and guidance system that could be used with their tracker. In spite of being a glide bomb, this was confusingly assigned a number as part of the new guided missile numbering system, becoming the AGM-62 Walleye.|$|E
