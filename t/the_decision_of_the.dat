5|$|Baldwin IV died {{in early}} 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV died {{in late summer}} 1186.

However, Sybilla's uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem {{with the support of}} Raynald and other {{influential}} prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the lawful monarch, according to the Estoire de Eracles. The bailli, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and reminded her partisans of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald's stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife's behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king's court.|$|E

5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Church Polity)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. According to <b>the</b> {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformed church polity, believers {{commit themselves}} {{on grounds of}} their common faith and confession to certain matters. The critical question which has to be answered in this study, is: To what extent do believers commit themselves to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church and what are <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> such a commitment? The central theoretical argument of this study is: The mutual agreement between believers to commit themselves to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is 'n voluntary commitment, because believers consider themselves as devouted to the Scriptures, confession and church order on which grounds <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church are taken. Chapter 2 investigates the origin and leading thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binding and commitment to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. Then there is a short historical overview on <b>the</b> shaping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept "binding and commitment to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church". Subsequently <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> this binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church as well as <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> fundamental and indifferent matters are explored. Chapter 3 focuses {{on the way in}} which believers commit themselves to the confession and also on the conflict surrounding the binding agreement to the confession. Furthermore <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> church denomination and the negative consequences when <b>the</b> binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church are ignored, are examined. In the last instance, the way in which churches should bind themselves to the church order and <b>the</b> positive results <b>of</b> such a binding, are investigated. Chapter 4 highlights the main problems which lead to a misconception in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binding agreement to <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. Then <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> deviation from <b>the</b> binding agreement to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, is reviewed. Furthermore the conflict in South-Africa about <b>the</b> binding to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, especially within the Reformed Churches in South-Africa, is looked at. In chapter 5 the misconceptions about binding to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church are pointed out. Next, <b>the</b> distinctive character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binding to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is dealt with. Subsequently the demands and commitments which arise from <b>the</b> binding to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church are explored, as well as the positive results obtained when maintaining the binding agreement to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The final part emphasizes the responsibility to extend and to bring to <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> believers <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> binding to <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.
