500|$|Davidson opines that Siggeir's {{anger at}} his {{inability}} to gain the sword that Odin has plunged into Barnstokkr at first sight appears excessive, and states {{that there may be}} an underlying reason for Siggeir's passionate desire for the sword. Davidson notes that the gift of the sword was made at a wedding feast, and states that Barnstokkr likely represents the 'guardian tree', [...] "such as those that used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> many a house in Sweden and Denmark, and which was associated with the 'luck' of the family", and that the 'guardian tree' also had a connection with the birth of children. Davidson cites Jan de Vries in that the name barnstokkr [...] "used in this story was the name given to the trunk of such a tree because it used to be invoked and even clasped by the women of the family at the time of childbirth." ...|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{composed}} songs {{throughout his}} career, and his output in the genre is extensive. In Johnson's view, {{most of the}} finest were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Though widely varied in character, the songs are dominated by Poulenc's preference for certain poets. From the outset of his career he favoured verses by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the writer whose work he set most often was Paul Éluard. Other poets whose works he frequently set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and Louise de Vilmorin. In {{the view of the}} music critic Andrew Clements, the Éluard songs include many of Poulenc's greatest settings; Johnson calls the cycle Tel Jour, Telle Nuit (1937) the composer's [...] "watershed work", and Nichols regards it as [...] "a masterpiece worthy <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> Fauré's La bonne chanson". Clements finds in the Éluard settings a profundity [...] "worlds away from the brittle, facetious surfaces of Poulenc's early orchestral and instrumental music". The first of the Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon (1943), titled simply [...] "C", is described by Johnson as [...] "a masterpiece known the world over; it is the most unusual, and perhaps the most moving, song about the ravages of war ever composed." ...|$|E

500|$|Anna in {{particular}} and the whole film in general had undergone a number {{of changes in the}} story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, [...] "Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of it that we didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so we changed some of the animation to support it." [...] Bell generally described her character as [...] "She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined." [...] Lee added, [...] "She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing." [...] Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, [...] " [...] secret weapon is love," [...] while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is [...] "a character who is willing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong." [...] In the images of Frozens main characters released by Disney in July 2013, Anna and her role in the film was described as follows: ...|$|E

After complaining to Scotland, Knoechlein alleges that he was doused in cold water, pushed down stairs, and beaten. He claimed he was forced <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> a hot gas stove before being showered with cold water. He claimed that he and another prisoner were forced to run in circles while carrying heavy logs.|$|E

His body was recovered an hour later, and he was confirmed dead. Budd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Tootal, described Budd {{at the time of}} his death as [...] "an outstanding leader" [...] who had a professional manner [...] "that inspired confidence in all that worked with him". Tootal said: [...] "Bryan died doing the job he loved, leading his men from the front, where he always was. He was proud to call himself a paratrooper and we were proud <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite all the threats, boycotts, and defamation, the Israeli {{establishment}} has {{woken up}} and begun <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> Naddaf. In November 2012, {{a month after}} the first conference of the Christian IDF Forum, the director of the National Civic Service, Sar-Shalom Gerbi, came to Nazareth: [...] "to express his support to Naddaf for his steadfastness and unwavering support for encouraging young Christians to integrate into the community in Israel". Gerbi said at that meeting, that: [...] "this is a courageous act, a man of letters, undeterred by threats and pressures and insists on serving the country... I hope that law enforcement authorities will act decisively to stop the campaign of incitement and de-legitimization of Naddaf and against the young men and women doing national service". About two weeks later, Gerbi met with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilus III, who promised him that Nadaf will not be boycotted by the Church.|$|E

2500|$|The rest, {{thought to}} number several thousand, were bound {{together}} {{in groups of}} three or four and had their hands tied to be marched naked before the Sultan. [...] Ordered to proceed, a group of executioners proceeded to kill each group in turn, either by decapitation or by severing their limbs from the body. [...] Nevers {{and the rest of the}} noble captives were forced <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>beside</b> Bayezid and watch the executions. [...] Jean Le Maingre, called [...] "Boucicaut", was recognized in the line, and Nevers fell to his knees before the Sultan and indicated with intertwined fingers that they were like brothers. [...] Thus convinced that Boucicaut was worth a noble ransom, he was spared and grouped with the other high nobles. [...] The killing continued from early morning until late afternoon, at which point Bayezid, either himself sickened by the bloodshed or convinced by his ministers that he was unnecessarily enraging Christendom against him, called off the executioners. [...] Leaving aside the more hyperbolic account, the number of dead is said to have ranged from 300 to 3,000, though the number of dead on the battlefield was much more.|$|E
