25|$|The latter aspect {{was usually}} a {{consequence}} of one of <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> reflecting on the past. Nostalgia was a strong thread running through the show. <b>The</b> <b>lads</b> frequently did ask each other the question in the show's title, Whatever happened to us?, particularly during their more mellow moments in the pub.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lads</b> {{attended}} Park Infants School, Park Junior School, and Park Secondary Modern. Thelma {{was with}} them for infants and juniors, but {{then went to the}} grammar school. One of Bob's most notable school romances is the often mentioned but unseen Deirdre Birchwood, who was the basis of a running joke in Series 1, where any mention of her (or of any other former girlfriend of Bob's) was guaranteed to upset Thelma. (A Deidre Birchwood actually appears in an episode of the Bewes vehicle, Dear Mother...Love Albert, and is referred to in many episodes of that programme. Her name comes from a little girl Bewes knew in real life, he was re-united with her on This is Your Life.) <b>The</b> <b>lads</b> also were in the Scouts together.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} humour, the two shows are very different. The Likely Lads {{had been a}} broad comedy, full of jokes and obvious gags, whereas Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? used much subtler humour, derived from the {{dialogue}} and characterisation, often interspersed with sentimentality (as <b>the</b> <b>Lads</b> mourned their lost past), and even touches of pathos.|$|E

50|$|Early in 1997, North American fans of {{the series}} started a {{petition}} on IGN's PSX Power for a Western release {{of the first two}} games of the series. In 2000, Working Designs hinted that they would be localizing all three of the Arc games for a North American release in a bundle called Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> Collection. On April 18, 2002, after a series of unmet release dates, <b>the</b> Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> Collection was released in North America. This was the first time North American gamers were able to play the popular Japanese-exclusive series. The collection encompasses six discs and four games: Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad,</b> Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> II, Arc Arena: Monster Tournament, and Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> III.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>LAD</b> was {{contoured}} {{separately from}} the heart, using mediastinal CT windows. <b>The</b> <b>LAD</b> is difficult to visualize in a CT scan because its location is inferred from {{the course of the}} anterior-interventricular groove, conseguentely we added a 10 -mm axial margin to <b>the</b> <b>LAD</b> to allow for delineation uncertainty and respiratory/cardiac motion (i.e. LAD +  1  cm).|$|R
25|$|The movie {{opened with}} <b>the</b> <b>Lads</b> lamenting the {{demolition}} of their favourite pub, The Fat Ox, before they go on a caravanning holiday with Thelma and Chris. The complications resulting from the trip lead to Terry and Chris splitting up, {{as a result of}} which Terry decides to emigrate, signing on as a crewman on a cargo ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} {{of this would be}} very easy. The politics would be, to be one of <b>the</b> <b>lads,</b> the safest way in Ireland. But I {{do not believe that the}} interests of this State, or our Constitution and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this. There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E
25|$|One {{episode of}} Harry & Paul {{featured}} a sketch, {{split in two}} parts called On the TARDIS, which was a cross between Doctor Who and On the Buses. Stan Butler (Harry Enfield) played the Doctor while Jack Harper (Paul Whitehouse) was the companion. The pair were planning to flee from Olivia (finding her far more frightening than the Daleks) {{to go to the}} planet Raving Nympho to be with lots of girls. Instead, they land on the planet Woolly Woofter and encounter camp people. In Part 2, Blakely turned up as The Master before <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> got what they wanted: three gorgeous girls.|$|E
60|$|About <b>the</b> <b>lad's</b> beauty it is {{needless to}} say what the {{carpenter}} thought; but that night, and for many many nights after, <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> stayed at Mr. Hayes's.|$|R
6000|$|She. What's a' {{the joys}} that gowd can gie? [...] I dinna care a single flie; [...] <b>The</b> <b>lad</b> I love's <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> for me, [...] And that's my ain dear Willy.|$|R
6000|$|As {{soon as she}} {{was gone}} <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> took <b>the</b> pin out of his master's coat, who {{instantly}} awoke. The first word he said to <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> was, 'Have you seen her?' ...|$|R
25|$|Only {{a couple}} of days ago, <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> from Somerset had beaten Australia's finest by five wickets, chasing the highest score in one-day matches. Now, they failed to chase down 233 set by the Scottish Saltires, after Jonathan Beukes smashed 92 and Yasir Arafat {{supplied}} with a 20-ball 32 including two sixes. It started well enough for Somerset, Graeme Smith continuing his fine form with 74, leading his team to 158 for 4. But then, the wheels fell off. Paul Hoffmann snared the important wicket of James Hildreth for 49, the lower order rolled over meekly to Arafat (who got 3-33), and with Jon Francis injured, the Sabres managed to lose the match by 15 runs as they were all out for 218.|$|E
500|$|In 1971 British glam {{rock band}} Chicory Tip {{paid tribute to}} Sheppard in Don't Hang Jack, the B-side to I Love Onions. The song, {{apparently}} sung {{from the viewpoint of}} a witness in the courtroom, describes Jack's daring exploits as a thief, and futilely begs the judge to spare Sheppard because he was loved by the women of the town, and idolised by <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> who [...] "made him their king." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There were 58 boys in {{the school}} when I {{inspected}} it. [...] I was glad to find that more of the ordinary farming processes were being resorted to; the plough and other common agricultural machines employed, so that the training of <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> as farm servants would be gradually made more complete than the use of spade labour allows of. The books are well kept. The punishments had been much fewer, chiefly fines or loss of privilege. [...] :The cost per head for the year was 18l. 9s. 11d." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{this she}} went off, {{and as soon}} as she had gone <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> took <b>the</b> pin out of his master's coat. He awoke instantly, and the first word he said was, 'Have you seen her?' <b>The</b> <b>lad</b> said that he had, and there was the sword she had left for him. The Irishman was ready to kill <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> out of sheer vexation, but when he gave a glance over his {{shoulder}} not a trace of <b>the</b> fair-haired <b>lad</b> was left.|$|R

500|$|The Horrors, an English {{new wave}} band, {{performed}} a cover version of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] during an {{edition of the}} Live Lounge on BBC Radio 1. Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote, [...] " [...] reworking the song from fierce anthem to a decidedly Smiths-ian weep-fest, <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> struck the perfect balance between the sass of the original and their own depressing sound." [...] Krissi Murison of NME commented that their cover was [...] "undoubtedly the greatest song psychedelic shoegaze never had". [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] was also covered by The X Factor contestant, Craig Colton, during {{the second week of}} the competition, in accordance with the theme 'Love and Heartbreak'.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of 1976–77 season, Keegan said, [...] "There's a {{tremendous}} ambition among all <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> to win the European Cup. We've won {{everything else in the}} last five years and there's a feeling that the European Cup is going to be next." [...] Liverpool started by losing only two of their first 16 games in the League to go top by September. Despite a Christmas period blip including a 5–1 loss to Aston Villa, Liverpool won their tenth League title. The 1977 European Cup Final was Liverpool's first. McDermott, Smith and Neal goals gave a 3-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. They lost the 1977 FA Cup Final 2-1 to Manchester United to miss out on a trophy treble.|$|E
500|$|Gateshead {{qualified}} for the Conference Premier play-offs {{for the first time}} in their history after finishing third in the table in 2013–14, which represented the club's highest league placing since being voted out of the Football League in 1960. With a 4–2 aggregate win over Grimsby Town in the semi-final, Gateshead played at Wembley Stadium {{for the first time in}} the play-off final; despite entering the match on the back of a 14-match unbeaten run they were beaten 2–1 by Cambridge United. Mills said after the match that [...] "I told <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> that they'll be better for it. My job next year is to emulate or better this season". He was named the Non-League Manager of the Year for 2013–14 at the National Game Awards, ahead of John Still, who led Luton to the Conference Premier title.|$|E
50|$|According to Chomsky, {{humans are}} born {{with a set of}} {{language}} learning tools referred to as <b>the</b> <b>LAD.</b> <b>The</b> <b>LAD</b> is an abstract part of the human mind which houses the ability for humans to acquire and produce language. Chomsky expressed that children are able to derive rules of a language through hypothesis testing because they are equipped with a <b>LAD.</b> <b>The</b> <b>LAD</b> then transforms these rules into basic grammar. Hence, according to Chomsky, <b>the</b> <b>LAD</b> explains why children seem to have the innate ability to acquire a language and accounts for why no explicit teaching is required for a child to acquire a language.|$|R
50|$|Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> Collection was {{released}} in 2002 and boasted four separate games--Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> I, II, III and Monster Arena, a side-game that allows players to take captured monsters from Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> II and use them in combat. The collection also featured a making of CD, DualShock controller thumb pads, a memory card holder, character standees, a hardcover instruction booklet, and a glossy box (omake box) to hold it all.|$|R

500|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was asked}} after the match whether Leeds United had failed during the season: [...] "Failed? Second in the championship. Cup finalists. Ninety percent of {{managers}} would pray for 'failures' like that." [...] Leeds manager Don Revie was disappointed to lose, but praised his players' efforts in defeat: [...] "There's {{no doubt about}} it, the better side won, but, at least <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> played their guts out for me. He admitted it was disappointing to finish second in both the League and FA Cup: [...] "It's a bit disappointing to finish second in both Cup and League, but {{we have had a}} wonderful first season back in Division One, and I am very pleased with the team." [...] Captain Collins echoed his manager's sentiments: [...] "We have had a great season, but lost both honours. We shall be having a go again next season." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud}} of his players despite their defeat: [...] "We wanted to come here and win today but the players have done the club proud, I think today we were playing against a top team and I think we have got a lot to be proud of." [...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E
500|$|Though Everton {{had won a}} {{place in}} the European Cup, English clubs were banned from European {{competitions}} following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Southall remained bitter over this, blaming UEFA for the tragedy and stating that the ban was a convenient way to break up English dominance of European competitions. Limited to domestic competitions, Everton won the FA Charity Shield with a 2–0 win over Manchester United; during the celebrations Southall wore a T-shirt saying [...] "I Love My Wife" [...] as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair. After getting sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, Kendall criticised Southall in the press by saying he [...] "let <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> down". Despite this set-back, he agreed to sign a six-year contract in December, which was then the longest contract the club had ever issued. However, he twisted his ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play. In his absence, his deputy Bobby Mimms took his place, and Everton lost both the league title and the 1986 FA Cup Final to Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|Soon, {{a tenant}} sent {{a man to}} get a wether to give as a wedding gift. <b>The</b> Shifty <b>Lad</b> bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> put a dirty shoe in his path; the man {{said that if he}} had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. <b>The</b> Shifty <b>Lad</b> ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> took <b>the</b> wether and the shoes and won his bet. The tenant sent the same man after a kid. <b>The</b> <b>lad</b> bleated like <b>the</b> wether, and when the man searched for it, {{thinking}} to come back with both, <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> stole <b>the</b> kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home.|$|R
50|$|On December 6, 2016, Sony's new mobile game studio, ForwardWorks, {{announced}} that a new Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> game was in development for iOS and Android smartphones, and that the original Arc <b>the</b> <b>Lad</b> staff will be working on the game.|$|R

500|$|In late 2009, McAdams {{starred in}} the mystery/action-adventure film Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. She played Irene Adler, an {{antagonist}} and love interest of Downey's title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed {{the opportunity to play}} a character who is [...] "her own boss and a real free spirit". Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies and also something for <b>the</b> <b>lads,</b> who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls." [...] The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E
500|$|Jon Auer, {{co-founder of}} the American power pop band The Posies, {{recorded}} a cover of the song on his 2001 solo EP 6 ½. Website Stereogum listed the cover at number five on their list of The 20 Best Indie Rock Madonna Covers. A 2007 folk music tribute compilation to Madonna, entitled Through the Wilderness, features a cover of the song by Golden Animals. Australian rock band DMA's covered the song during their BBC Radio 1 sessions with Annie Mac on March 8, 2016. Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound website praised the cover saying that it would [...] "undoubtedly be hailed as yet another successful entry in DMA's young career" [...] and described the cover as [...] "easily tweaking the swirling, retro number into a psychedelic, arena-ready anthem". Michael Carr from Music Feeds magazine also praised the cover saying [...] "Lending itself surprisingly well to the boys’ shoegazey brit pop treatment, <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> absolutely nail it... To be honest though, they kind of won on song choice alone".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Rush {{collected}} the trophy from the Royal box at Wembley Stadium. Liverpool's victory meant Rush won {{the competition for}} the fifth time in his career, which is a record. McManaman was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as man of the match. McManaman praised the performance of the Bolton players: [...] "Give Bolton their due, they battled {{back in the second half}} like we knew they would but it was a great team effort by our lads and I was just happy to get two goals like that." [...] Liverpool manager Roy Evans praised the performance of McManaman stating: [...] "The two goals were fantastic. Sometimes he does need a kick up the backside, but they were really two great goals." [...] Evans was also delighted to have won his first trophy as Liverpool manager: [...] "We believed that we've always had a decent squad with players of outstanding ability. The way <b>the</b> <b>lads</b> have worked this season is outstanding. This cup is the first step. We are in Europe and we are delighted." ...|$|E

From various causes, all of the conspirators either died or were killed except for one, who was executed after <b>the</b> <b>lad</b> Almagro gave an order. <b>The</b> <b>lad</b> De Almagro fought the desperate battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542, escaped to Cuzco, but was arrested, immediately condemned to death, and executed in the great square of the city.|$|R
