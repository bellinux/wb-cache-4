The thermal efficiency of the solar ponds is between 15 and 25 % of the incoming horizontal solar radiation. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric technology enables the conversion of heat into electricity using thermoelectric modules. In this paper, the feasibility of the system by combining solar pond and thermoelectric modules is presented. This system {{can be achieved by}} using a <b>thermoelectric</b> modules-embedded <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>module</b> that will able to extract the heat available from the lower convective zone of the solar pond.

40|$|An {{electron}} {{heat flow}} {{can occur in}} a partially ionized plasma in response to either an electron temperature gradient (thermal conduction) or an electron current (<b>thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> flow). The former process has been extensively studied, while the latter process has received relatively little attention. Therefore a time-dependent three-dimensional model of the high-latitude ionosphere was used to study the effect of field-aligned ionospheric return currents on auroral electron temperatures for different seasonal and solar cycle conditions {{as well as for}} different upper boundary heat fluxes. The results of this study lead to the following conclusions: (1) The average, large-scale, return current densities, which are a few microamps per square meter, are too small to affect auroral electron temperatures. (2) Current densities greater than about 10 − 5 A m− 2 are needed for <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> flow to be important. (3) The thermoelectric effect displays a marked solar cycle and seasonal dependence. (4) <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> transport corresponds to an upward flow of electron energy. (5) This energy flow can be either a source or sink of electron energy, depending on the altitude and geophysical conditions. (6) <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> transport is typically a sink above 300 km and acts to lower ambient electron temperatures by as much as 2000 K for field-aligned return current densities of the order of 5 × 10 − 5 A m− 2. For this case, the electron temperature decreases with altitude above 300 km with a gradient that can exceed 1 K km− 1. Also, the electron temperature can drop below both the ion and neutral temperatures in the upper F region owing to thermoelectric cooling.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 150 - 152) A Peltier Effect Diffusion Still (PEDS) is {{a multiple}} effect evaporator driven by solid state <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> pumps {TEHPs}. TEHPs {{embedded in the}} walls between diffusion cells enhance the temperature gradient driving the separation process. To demonstrate feasibility, PEDS is applied to milk concentration. The classic lumped parameter TEHP equations are reformulated {{and the effect of}} thin film thermoelectrics included. Thin film, rather than modular TEHPs are imperative to control thermal contact resistance. The concept of a limiting pressure in each diffusion cell is introduced that resolves conflicting criteria between low diffusion resistance and evaporation without flashing. PEDS system performance is predicted with an algorithm that solves a multiply-nested, simultaneous heat and mass transfer problem, subject to the constraints imposed by <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>heat</b> pumping. For a broad range of operating conditions, the TEHP temperature rise approximately balances the chamber temperature drop, so small changes in external temperatures drive large changes in heat flux. For multiple cell separation processes, parallel and serial feed streams yield essentially the same result.
