5|$|By 28 October 1850 {{the final}} section of the main line to Carlisle was {{completed}} by the GD, and trains began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> to Carlisle; evidently the difficulty with the Caledonian Railway from Gretna southwards had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|A {{state highway}} was routed through {{downtown}} starting on May 13, 1913, {{when the system}} was created. It was first a part of M-15 when the highway system was signed in 1919, and then later as US41/M-28 after {{the creation of the}} United States Numbered Highway System in 1926. (Under the original 1925 draft plan for the U.S. Highway System, US102 was the number assigned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> Marquette.) The streets have been paved since at least the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1937, {{however, the}} highway's {{southern}} terminus had changed once again. On 1937-10-19, SH-8 had been truncated to Anadarko. However, on 1938-10-18, the route was extended back to the former southern terminus at Randlett; this change did not appear on the state map until the April 1941 edition. On 1941-04-14, the route was realigned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> Cyril once again.|$|E

5|$|On 4 July 1932 the District {{service from}} Acton Town to South Harrow was {{withdrawn}} {{and one in}} three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields, continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933. District trains continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> to Hounslow off-peak, with a shuttle from South Acton.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings and stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs {{to the south of}} the stadium, should be moved <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
5|$|Roth {{produced}} the Chicago production. The Chicago cast included Nora Dunn, Felicia Fields, Roni Geva, Katie O'Brien and Barbara Robertson as Gingy. Although {{the show was}} originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> October 23, 2011, it was extended to December 4 before opening and later extended again to January 1, 2012. The post-Chicago national tour performances were set to be headlined by the December 730 Off-Broadway cast that included Daisy Eagan, Sonia Manzano and Loretta Swit.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> a series of landing simulations.|$|E
5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|Bardia did {{not become}} an {{important}} port as supply by sea continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> Sollum but became {{an important source of}} water, after the repair of the large pumping station that the Italians had installed to serve the township and Fort Capuzzo. Axis forces reoccupied the town in April 1941, during Operation Sonnenblume Rommel's first offensive in Cyrenaica. Further fighting occurred from 31 December 1941 – 2 January 1942, before Bardia was re-taken by the 2nd South African Division. Bardia changed hands again in June 1942, being occupied by Axis forces for a third time and was re-taken for the last time in November unopposed, following the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E
5|$|Fun Home premiered Off-Broadway at The Public Theater in previews on September 30, 2013, {{and opened}} officially on October 22, 2013. Originally {{scheduled}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> November 3, 2013, the run was extended several times, and the musical closed on January 12, 2014. The production {{was directed by}} Sam Gold, with sets and costumes by David Zinn, lighting by Ben Stanton, projections by Jim Findlay and Jeff Sugg, and choreography by Danny Mefford. In response to a controversy in which the legislature of South Carolina attempted to financially punish the College of Charleston for choosing the original graphic novel of Fun Home as a reading selection for incoming freshmen, the off-Broadway cast presented a concert of songs from the musical to a full house in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 2014. Bechdel, Kron, Tesori and musical director Chris Fenwick accompanied the cast.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, US27 was shifted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> St. Louis instead of Alma, {{and the former}} route was renumbered US27A. US127 was realigned near Mason in the mid-1940s, and a {{business}} loop was created out of the former routing there. A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business loop. In the early 1960s, a new expressway (later freeway) for US27 through Central Michigan {{led to the creation}} of several business loops. Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business loops. The 2002 extension of US127 to replace US27 also led to the redesignation of business loops to their current monikers.|$|E
5|$|M-73 {{starts on}} its southwestern end on a {{bridge over the}} Brule River that connects across the state line to WIS55 in Forest County, Wisconsin. On the Michigan side of the border, the highway runs north away from the river. It runs along {{the western edge of}} a section of farm fields before turning eastward <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> them. M-73 passes to the south of Hagerman, Little Hagerman and Bass lakes, after which it turns northeasterly running north of Stanley Lake. The {{northern}} terminus is at US2 west of downtown Iron River. All of M-73 is two-lane rural highway through wooded terrain except the section immediately north of the state line which runs along the aforementioned farm.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 30, the 9th Infantry Regiment led the {{withdrawal}} by attacking the roadblock. Four tanks were first sent {{down the road and}} the Chinese held their fire. Encouraged by this development, Colonel Sloane ordered the 9th Infantry Regiment to press forward, but Chinese machine gun and mortar fire immediately stopped the advance at 9 a.m. The ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment attached to the 2nd Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the US 9th Infantry Regiment, but it was routed by friendly fire. With no contacts between the American commands and the British units, the Middlesex Regiment advanced to {{the south end of the}} valley without attacking the roadblock. Believing that the roadblock was short and the British were attacking up the road, Keiser ordered the 2nd Infantry Division <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> the blockade at 10 a.m.|$|E

5|$|Outside of {{the village}} of Manlius, the amount of {{development}} along the route decreases as the homes lining the route become more spaced out. NY92 follows Limestone Creek southeastward through the towns of Manlius and Pompey to the Madison County line, where the creek turns south <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> Pompey Hollow, an area of flatlands situated on the Onondaga County side of the line. The highway continues on into Madison County, where it becomes known as Syracuse Road as it heads through the town of Cazenovia. Most of NY92 in Madison County passes through rural, undeveloped areas; however, the section just north of its intersection with US20 runs along Cazenovia Lake and serves several lakeside homes. NY92 ends upon intersecting US20 at the southwestern tip of the lake just west {{of the village}} of Cazenovia.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Metro {{opened in}} 1966, {{consisting}} of a line through the Common Tunnel to Jernbanetorget and the upgraded Lambertseter light rail line. The same year the Grorud Line opened. The next year the Østensjø Line was connected, and in 1970 the Furuset Line opened. The city council decided to close the tramways in 1960, and several lines were closed until the decision was revoked in 1977. In 1987, the Common Tunnel was completed. From 1993, the western lines were upgraded and connected to the Metro, allowing Metro trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> the city centre. The Metro's Ring Line was completed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>through</b> the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
