5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who rode}} the Cannonball Loop {{have said that}} more safety {{measures}} were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, required to remove jewelry, and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.|$|E
25|$|Huston {{was known}} to direct with the vision of an artist, having studied {{and worked as a}} fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He {{continued}} to explore the visual aspects of his films throughout his career: sketching each scene on paper beforehand, <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, making them both more economical and cerebral, with little editing needed.|$|E
25|$|Many webs span {{gaps between}} objects which the spider could not cross by crawling. This {{is done by}} first {{producing}} a fine adhesive thread to drift on a faint breeze across a gap. When it sticks to a surface at the far end, the spider feels {{the change in the}} vibration. The spider reels in and tightens the first strand, <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> walks along it and strengthens it with a second thread. This process is repeated until the thread is strong enough to support the rest of the web.|$|E

25|$|A 2011 review {{examining}} musculoskeletal {{complications of}} fluoroquinolones proposed guidelines {{with respect to}} administration to athletes, that called for avoiding all use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if possible, {{and if they are}} used: ensure there is informed consent about the musculoskeletal risks, and inform coaching staff; do not use any corticosteroids if fluoroquinolones are used; consider dietary supplements of magnesium and antioxidants during treatment; reduce training until the course of antibiotic is finished and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> increase back to normal; and monitor for six months after the course is finished, and stop all athletic activity if symptoms emerge.|$|E
25|$|Minimal {{surfaces}} have {{a simple}} interpretation in real life: they are the shape a soap film will assume if a wire frame shaped like the curve is dipped into a soap solution and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> lifted out. The {{question as to whether}} a minimal surface with given boundary exists is called Plateau's problem after the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau who carried out experiments on soap films in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1930 Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó gave an affirmative answer to Plateau's problem (Douglas was awarded one of the first Fields medals for this work in 1936).|$|E
25|$|Women {{commonly}} have {{an everyday}} huipil and those worn only {{on special occasions}} such as weddings. Decorative elements are often arranged in horizontal bands but those with vertical orientation are found as well. In a number of indigenous communities, extravagant huipils made for a woman’s wedding is <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> put away and stored to be used later for her funeral. In others, a special huipil is begun when a woman reaches a certain age for this purpose. Ceremonial huipils are also made to dress images of saints. During festivals, these saints can be dressed in many layers of huipils, giving them a fattened appearance.|$|E

25|$|After English Heritage later {{discovered}} {{the damage was}} far more severe than initially thought, they stopped insisting on full restoration, albeit {{over the objections of}} the architectural conservationists who favoured reconstruction. The Baltic Exchange and the Chamber of Shipping sold the land to Trafalgar House in 1995. Most of the remaining structures on Baltic Exchange site were <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> dismantled, the interior of Exchange Hall and the façade were preserved, hoping for a reconstruction of the building in the future. The salvaged material was eventually sold for £800,000 and moved to Tallinn, Estonia, where it awaits reconstruction as the centrepiece of the city's commercial sector.|$|E
25|$|Sumatran orangutans use {{sticks to}} acquire seeds from a {{particular}} fruit. When {{the fruit of the}} Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that are highly desirable to the orangutans, but they are surrounded by fibreglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a 12cm stick, strip off the bark, and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Sumatran orangutans will use a stick to poke a bees' nest wall, move it around and catch the honey.|$|E
25|$|Encosternum delegorguei are {{collected}} {{just before dawn}} when they are least active and are easier to catch. They are caught carefully, {{taking care not to}} kill them. The chemicals released by the bugs can often stain the hands of collectors orange if they collect them barehanded. The bugs which died during collection are carefully separated from live bugs. This is because the chemicals stored in the stink glands are unpalatable - being extremely bitter. As dead bugs can not release the remaining chemicals in their bodies, they are deemed unsuitable for consumption and discarded. The remaining live bugs are placed in a bucket {{with a small amount of}} warm water. This is <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> agitated so as to make them release all their defense chemicals in alarm. This is repeated several more times until their stink glands are drained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Glinda, [...] "I {{remember}} that." [...] <b>Then</b> she <b>carefully</b> {{instructed the}} Scarecrow {{what to do}} and gave him certain magical things which he placed in the pockets of his ragged Munchkin coat.|$|R

25|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a {{peripheral}} nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal nerve tissue can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an operating microscope. If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can happen in a crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which {{can be as simple as}} closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve. The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.|$|E
500|$|Edson Jones {{eventually}} {{published his}} {{findings on the}} Arnold family in 1915, demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} Arnold family record, and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> revealing each inconsistency and factual error found in Somerby's pedigree. [...] In 1921, Fred Arnold summarized these findings and synthesized them into a coherent lineage of the Arnold family which is consistent with every known historical document, and presented his findings to the Rhode Island Historical Society. [...] To summarize the work of both Edson Jones and Fred Arnold, William Arnold was the son of Nicholas Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in Somerset based on the Arnold family record and the Northover parish register. [...] Arnold's mother was Alice Gully, and her parents were John and Alice Gully based on the same two documents. [...] These are the only known ancestors of William Arnold based on known historical records, and the parents of Nicholas Arnold have not been identified in any historical document.|$|E
2500|$|... {{maintains}} two {{historic buildings}} {{related to the}} extended Bell family: the first being their private residence (see item above) {{and the other one}} being The Henderson Home, Canada's first telephone company building of the nascent Bell Telephone Company of Canada. The Henderson Home was originally built on Sheridan Street within the city of Brantford, Ontario, and was <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> relocated in 1969 to its current site at the historic Bell Homestead site. Both the Bell Homestead and the Bell Telephone Company Building are open to visitation; ...|$|E

2500|$|The PICC line is {{inserted}} through a sheath into a peripheral vein sometimes using the Seldinger technique or modified Seldinger technique, under ultrasound guidance, {{usually in the}} arm, and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> advanced upward until the catheter is in the superior vena cava or the right atrium. This is usually done by measuring the distance to an external landmark, such as the suprasternal notch, to estimate the optimal length. [...] An X-ray must be used to verify that the tip is {{in the right place}} when fluoroscopy was not used during the insertion.|$|E
2500|$|In the laboratory, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is {{produced}} by a two-step process. [...] A nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono- and di-nitrotoluene isomers, with careful cooling to maintain temperature. [...] The nitrated toluenes are then separated, washed with dilute sodium bicarbonate to remove oxides of nitrogen, and <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> nitrated {{with a mixture of}} fuming nitric acid and sulfuric acid. [...] Towards the end of the nitration, the mixture is heated on a steam bath. [...] The trinitrotoluene is separated, washed with a dilute solution of sodium sulfite and then recrystallized from alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|The drill {{offers an}} ancient method of {{starting}} fire without matches or a lighter, {{a method that}} applies friction to generate heat. The heat eventually produces an ember in the burnt sawdust. The ember is tiny, smaller than {{the head of a}} cigarette, and fragile. Once the ember is formed it is carefully placed into a [...] "tinder bundle" [...] (a bird's type nest of stringy, fluffy, and combustible material). Once the ember is in the tinder bundle it is <b>then</b> <b>carefully</b> nurtured and coaxed into flame. Once the tinder bundle bursts into flame, it is placed into the fuel that has been assembled ready for ignition.|$|E
