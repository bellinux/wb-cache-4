40|$|In the {{framework}} of research activities on fusion reactors a great effort is dedicated by the scientific community {{to the development of}} <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blankets.</b> One of the main goals is to assess the neutronic behaviour of such devices to analyse their <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> performance and to evaluate the required data for their thermal-mechanic and thermal-hydraulic design. Many papers have been published on this topic considering some stationary condition to calculate such important quantities as heating power, gas production and dpa rates, <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> ratio, etc., but not much attention has been focussed to neutronic transport analyses in transient conditions. The present paper proposes a simple model based on the point kinetics approximation, which has been set up deriving an alternative formulation of the time-dependent neutron transport equation. This approach allows to define some physical characteristics that can be interpreted in a statistical way, making possible to calculate these quantities numerically by the Monte Carlo method. The adoption of the aforementioned numerical method has the great advantage that complex geometries (as the fusion reactor's blankets are) can be analysed with acceptable computational times. Some simple cases have been investigated to implement the theoretical model proposed with MCNP 5 code and to show its potentiality. Then, applications to fusion reactor ITER blanket module and to the Helium Cooled Test Blanket Module, to be tested in ITER, have been taken into account in order to assess their neutronic time-dependent behaviour and the results obtained have been critically discussed...|$|R

40|$|The project studies blanket {{designs of}} ITER and DEMO for neutron shielding, helium {{production}} and tritium breeding. On the one hand, a comparison {{has been made}} between beryllium and tungsten as first wall materials. On the other hand, <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> models have been studied, focus on the European test blanket module (TBM) concepts, the helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB) and the helium-cooled lithium-lead (HCLL). The choice of plasma facing materials and the tritium breeding technology are key issues in the technological development of future fusion power plants. Whereas the ITER design includes beryllium as the first wall material of the blanket and tungsten in the divertor, DEMO will possibly use tungsten for both surfaces, due to beneficial characteristics of this material related to lower tritium retention and lower erosion rates. As future DEMO-type reactors are intended to be tritium self-sufficient, the reactors would dedicate most of the blanket to tritium breeding. Both analytical (multigroup diffusion theory) and Monte-Carlo methods were utilized to calculate the neutron fluxes and neutron induced reactions. The Serpent code is used to run Monte-Carlo simulations. The results for the Be-W comparison indicate that W is a better first wall material in terms of blanket shielding capability for high-energy neutrons and showing lower helium production in the first wall. However, the simulations for the HCPB and HCLL models show {{that the use of}} a Be first wall instead of W leads to a substantial increment of the tritium breeding ratio (TBR), allowing the use of lithium with lower enrichment. The assessment of the European <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> concepts indicated that HCPB models have a higher TBR and better shielding capability than HCLL models, being the HCPB with Be as first wall the most efficient breeding blanket.

Of the several candidate lithium-containing ceramics being considered for use in the breeder blanket, Li{sub 2 }O, Li{sub 2 }TiO{sub 3 }, are attractive choices because of their low activation.

Many of the materials investigated and discussed for the latter applications are lithium metal oxides. A well known example is single or microcrystalline lithium niobate, LiNbO 3, which is not only interesting due to its ferroelectricity, but also due to its very slow lithium diffusion [1, 2].

40|$|The <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of a fusion reactor because it directly involves both energy extraction and tritium production, both of which are critical to fusion power. Because of their overall desirable properties, lithium-containing ceramic solids are recognized as attractive tritium breeding materials for fusion reactor blankets. Indeed, their inherent thermal stability and chemical inertness are significant safety advantages. In numerous in-pile experiments, these materials have performed well, showing good thermal stability and good tritium release characteristics. Tritium release is particularly facile when an argon or helium purge gas containing hydrogen, typically at levels of about 0. 1 %, is used. However, the addition of hydrogen to the purge gas imposes a penalty when it comes to recovery of the tritium produced in the blanket. In particular, a large amount of hydrogen in the purge gas will necessitate a large multiple-stage tritium purification unit, which could translate into higher costs. Optimizing tritium release while minimizing the amount of hydrogen necessary in the purge gas requires a deeper understanding of the tritium release process, especially the interactions of hydrogen with the surface of the lithium ceramic.

If the ignition beam is composed of deuterons, an additional energy is delivered to the target with increased energy gain. Therefore,in this innovative suggestion,we consider deuterium beams for fast ignition in D+ 3 He mixture and solve the dynamical balance equations under the available physical conditions by considering a new average reactivity formula,then we compute the energy gain in this mixture. Our computational results show that we can get energy gain value larger than 1000 at resonant temperature (380 keV) of D+ 3 He mixture. We select D+ 3 He fuel, because D+ 3 He reaction is very attractive from a theoretical point of view since it does not produced neutrons. The D+ 3 He benefits include full-lifetime materials, reduced radiation damage, less activation, absence of <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blankets,</b> highly efficient direct energy conversion, easier maintenance, proliferation resistance.

40|$|With {{the strong}} {{commitment}} of the US {{to the success of}} the ITER burning plasma mission, and the project overall, it is prudent to consider how to take the most advantage of this investment. The production of energy from fusion has been a long sought goal, and the subject of several programmatic investigations and time line proposals [1]. The nuclear aspects of fusion research have largely been avoided experimentally for practical reasons, resulting in a strong emphasis on plasma science. Meanwhile, ITER has brought into focus how the interface between the plasma and engineering/technology, presents the most challenging problems for design. In fact, this situation is becoming the rule and no longer the exception. ITER will demonstrate the deposition of 0. 5 GW of neutron heating to the blanket, deliver a heat load of 10 - 20 MW/m 2 or more on the divertor, inject 50 - 100 MW of heating power to the plasma, all at the expected size scale of a power plant. However, in spite of this, and a number of other technologies relevant power plant, ITER will provide a low neutron exposure compared to the levels expected to a fusion power plant, and will purchase its tritium entirely from world reserves accumulated from decades of CANDU reactor operations. Such a decision for ITER is technically well founded, allowing the use of conventional materials and water coolant, avoiding the thick <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>blankets</b> required for <b>tritium</b> self-sufficiency, and allowing the concentration on burning plasma and plasma-engineering interface issues. The neutron fluence experienced in ITER over its entire lifetime will be ~ 0. 3 MW-yr/m 2, while a fusion power plant is expected to experience 120 - 180 MW-yr/m 2 over its lifetime.

These vortices originate high tritium concentration zones. Hence, the existence of vortices is of crucial interest for tritium inventories prediction and HCLL design.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Tritium is an essential component of thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Unfortunately, tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, and one-half of the inventory disappears through radioactive decay every 12 years; therefore, it must be replenished. Until a few years ago, the only way to accomplish the tritium production mission was to use fission reactors. Recently, thanks to the development of new accelerator technologies (SDI and SSC studies) and to the post cold war era (international treaties limiting the number of warheads and therefore the tritium requirements), accelerator-based production of tritium seems feasible and is being investigated. The production of tritium using accelerators is a two step process: the production of neutrons in the 'target' and the use of these neutrons in the 'blanket assembly'. The systems described in this thesis employ a linear accelerator (1 GeV protons, I 00 mA beam current), lead targets for the production of neutrons via spallation reactions, and tritium breeding regions (blankets containing ' 6 Li in various mixtures). The high energy interactions and the particle transport were modeled with the LAHET computer code system. Heterogeneous and homogeneous spallation target/blanket systems were investigated.

For these two helium-cooled blanket concepts various tritium migration analyses will be carried out by means of the computational tool FUS-TPC to define proper and feasible tritium mitigation techniques, which are needed to keep the tritium losses lower than the allowable environmental release (i. e., 20 Ci/d...|$|R
40|$|Fusion power {{offers the}} {{prospect}} of an almost inexhaustible source of energy for future generations. Although this may be true, it also presents so far serious scientific and engineering challenges. <b>Breeding</b> <b>Blanket</b> is one of key components of future fusion reactors, since it directly involves <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> and energy extraction, both of them critical to development of fusion power. To deal with the development of <b>Breeding</b> <b>Blankets,</b> ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development) designed and built a lead lithium loop (IELLLO: Integrated European Lead Lithium LOop) : the experiment aims to support R&D activities for the conceptual and preliminary design of the European test blanket systems. IELLLO was completed, installed and operated at ENEA Brasimone Research Centre. The purpose of this work is to describe the experimental activities that have been carried out concerning the qualification of the facility, and relative instrumentations, for lead lithium application...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of an optimal configuration for the breeder zone (BZ) cooling tubes {{is one of}} the most important issues in the DEMO Water-Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> R&D activities, since BZ cooling tubes spatial distribution should ensure an efficient heat power removal from the breeder, avoiding hotspots occurrence in the thermal field. Within the framework of R&D activities supported by the HORIZON 2020 EUROfusion Consortium action on the DEMO WCLL <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> design, a campaign of parametric analyses has been launched at the Department of Energy, Information Engineering and Mathematical Models of the University of Palermo (DEIM), in close cooperation with ENEA-Brasimone, in order to assess the potential influence of BZ cooling tubes number on the thermal performances of the DEMO WCLL outboard <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> equatorial module under the nominal steady state operative conditions envisaged for it, optimizing their geometric configuration and taking also into account that a large number of cooling pipes can deteriorate the <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> performances of the module. In particular, attention has been focused on the toroidal-radial option for the BZ tube bundles lay-out and a parametric study has been carried out taking into account different tube bundles arrangement within the module. The study has been carried out following a numerical approach, based on the finite element method (FEM), and adopting a qualified commercial FEM code. Results obtained are herewith presented and critically discussed...|$|R

Besides the achievement, with margin, of the <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> ratio (TBR) minimum requirement, it exhibits an internal layout allowing it to withstand properly electromagnetic loads during plasma disruption and vertical displacement events, and pressure loads in case of rupture of an internal cooling channel (i. e. in-box LOCA). During the first part of 1998, the design has been optimised improving the performance in terms of TBR, enlarging the design margins with respect to the dimensioning loads and investigating in detail the global behaviour of the system during normal and off-normal conditions. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the fusion reactor since it involves <b>tritium</b> <b>breeding</b> and energy extraction, both of which are critically important for the development of fusion power. Lithium ceramics have long been considered as attractive materials for <b>breeding</b> <b>blanket</b> due to their excellent tritium release, thermal stability and chemical inertness [1]. In practice, blanket is subject to high energy neutrons and energetic particles from nuclear reactions. Tritium release from the lithium ceramics under irradiation is one of critical issues of current interest, and the understanding is very limited about the details of the processes. In some cases where desorption is the rate-determining step in tritium release, the surface properties of the lithium ceramics may {{play an important role in}} the processes [2]. Thus there are practical needs to study the influence of irradiation on the surface status of the lithium ceramics in reactor and in laboratory using various kinds of irradiation sources. The Kelvin probe is a non-contact, non-destructive vibrating capacitor device used to measure the work function (wf) difference or the surface potential between a conducting specimen and a vibrating probe for metals and semi-conductors. The wf is a multi...|$|R
