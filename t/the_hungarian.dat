5|$|The {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> {{language}} {{is one of}} the main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars.|$|E

50|$|After Svatopluk's {{death in}} 894, <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> ravaged Pannonia, {{becoming}} enemies of Arnulf, threatening Frankish Pannonia. The critical situation came after <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> had occupied <b>the</b> Pannonian basin between the Tisza and Danube. Thus, in 895 or 896, Arnulf entrusted Mosapurc (modern Zalavár, Hungary) and Pannonia to Braslav, thereby strengthening {{the defense of}} his southeastern frontier. Arnulf and Braslav could not stop <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians,</b> and Pannonia was subsequently overran by <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> Braslav was last mentioned in a source dating to 898, at which time <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> with a great army had breached into Italy for the first time, having crossed the Slavic lands.|$|R
50|$|Several events {{strengthened}} Luitpold's {{resolve to}} start a campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> During <b>the</b> last <b>Hungarian</b> attacks against Bavaria, Luitpold's forces defeated some of their units in minor battles, including Laibach (901) and Fischa River (903). In 904, the Bavarians assassinated Kurszán after feigning a desire for a peace treaty to which they invited him to negotiate. After these setbacks, for a time <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> did not attack Bavaria. These events and <b>the</b> belief <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> were afraid of his forces convinced Luitpold {{the time was right}} to expel <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> from <b>the</b> territories formerly belonging to Bavaria.|$|R

Seven municipalities in Croatia introduced Hungarian for official use (either in part of their territory or the entire municipality), depending on the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> population there. There are five Hungarian minority organizations in Croatia, and <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> minority is guaranteed one seat in the Croatian Parliament.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hungarians,</b> {{encouraged}} by their successful raids, began another invasion into Germany {{in the spring}} of 955. Otto's army, now unhindered by civil war, was able to defeat the invasion, and soon <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> sent an ambassador to seek peace with Otto. The ambassador proved to be a decoy: Otto's brother Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, sent word to Otto that <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> had crossed into his territory from the southeast. <b>The</b> main <b>Hungarian</b> army had camped along the Lech River and besieged Augsburg. While the city was defended by Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg, Otto assembled his army and marched south to face <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, at {{the monastery}} the Austrians were successful: they {{occupied}} the vineyard {{on the hill}} and got nearer towards to <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> After they put their flag {{as a symbol of}} victory, they fought with <b>the</b> hiding <b>Hungarians</b> on Elisabeth Island. <b>The</b> <b>Hungarians</b> made them retreat to Ács.|$|R
5|$|King Louis the Child held {{a meeting}} at Regensburg in 901 to {{introduce}} further measures against <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> Moravian envoys proposed a peace between Moravia and East Francia, because <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> had in <b>the</b> meantime plundered their country. A Hungarian army invading Carinthia was defeated in April and Aventinus describes a defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> by Margrave Luitpold at the river Fischa in the same year.|$|R
5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{writes that}} several appeals {{were made to}} Horthy, {{including}} by the Swiss government, President Franklin D.

On 26 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by <b>the</b> <b>Hungarian</b> government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy.

50|$|Around 830, a {{rebellion}} {{broke out in}} the Khazar khaganate. As a result, three Kabar tribes of the Khazars joined <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> and moved to what <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> call <b>the</b> Etelköz, the territory between the Carpathians and the Dnieper River. <b>The</b> <b>Hungarians</b> faced their first attack by the Pechenegs around 854, though other sources state that an attack by Pechenegs was the reason for their departure to Etelköz. The new neighbours of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> were <b>the</b> Varangians and the eastern Slavs. From 862 onwards, <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> (already referred to as the Ungri) along with their allies, the Kabars, started a series of looting raids from the Etelköz into the Carpathian Basin, mostly against the Eastern Frankish Empire (Germany) and Great Moravia, but also against the Balaton principality and Bulgaria.|$|R

40|$|Nicetas Choniates is {{the most}} {{significant}} and well-known Byzantine historian of the 12 th century. This paper deals with his passages about <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians,</b> in particular with the representation of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians.</b> <b>The</b> analysis is partly based on sporadic data found in the orations of Choniates, and chiefly on the related pieces of his History. A close inspection of these sources leads to three basic conclusions: 1) The representation of <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> by Nicetas Choniates is fundamentally influenced by the contemporary Byzantine stereotypes, although sometimes one can feel a more open-minded approach towards strangers, characteristic of his time. 2) In the text of Choniates, <b>the</b> <b>Hungarians</b> also represent <b>the</b> mere “crowd”, as the other non-Byzantine nations do, and their representation is often subordinated to the author’s conception of history. 3) <b>The</b> <b>Hungarians</b> seem to be near the Western people in the hierarchy of barbarians...|$|R
