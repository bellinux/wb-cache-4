6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear friend; {{and perhaps}} I shall ask you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of mine before I have done. But {{never mind that}} now. What {{did she tell you}} about the adventure?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} are pleased {{with my little}} present,' he said. 'The truth is that I brought it to propitiate 'ee, and to get you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of a mighty difficulty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "I {{would like}} you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of this desert place, {{if you can do}} so, for it is a poor spot for any Christian soul to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm 'ighly grateful, Muster Corkran. I've 'ad to {{run against}} you pretty hard in the way o' business, now and then, but I will say that outside o' business--bounds an' smokin', an' such like--I don't wish {{to have a more}} {{trustworthy}} young gentleman <b>to</b> <b>'elp</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of a hole. The way you 'andled the drill was beautiful, though I say it. Now, if you come regular henceforward--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I must say, Conny {{was very}} {{friendly}} {{to me after}} having been very angry with me for leaving him since [...] "Viva". He accepted me from the beginning <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>out</b> of this came [...] "Néondian"." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Both, lad, both--some of everything. Well, as I was saying--and you've a {{right to}} know what's running in my head, seeing that you have <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> carry <b>out</b> the plans--I'll give you a rough notion of 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I command thee," [...] said Abdallah the fagot-maker, who was {{not half}} so frightened {{at the sight of}} the monster this time as he had been before--"I command thee <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of this woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a garden}} party my girls are giving to-morrow afternoon," [...] the Colonel answered. [...] "I {{promised to take}} some of you down. Come, who's going <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out?</b> Wrayson? Good! Heneage? Excellent! Mason? Good fellows, all of you! Two-twenty from Waterloo, flannels and straw hats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{ought to}} be generous enough to do so, but not being a Jaques, with a {{convenient}} glacier <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of the predicament, I am afraid I should be hard to manage. I love but few, and those few are my world; so do not try me too hardly, Sylvia." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{this thought}} {{occurred}} to me: how heedless I have been! When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me should have begged a boy like him <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get <b>out</b> of this place; he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.|$|R
5000|$|Magne Furuholmen {{describes}} Waaktaar-Savoy thus: [...] "Pål is {{the person}} who has meant most to me in my musical development and yet he’s the one person I find it most difficult to say anything sensible about. He has incredible will-power and a watchful eye, always searching for material he can use creatively. In a way, I have idolized Pål for years and I still depend on him <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> sort <b>out</b> my own ideas." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "But one day, {{after another}} round of begging God <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> figure <b>out</b> what was wrong and take it all away, I got an answer that I wasn’t expecting. Very clearly, I felt him say “I can’t heal what you won’t acknowledge.” And it changed {{everything}} for me. That very day, the shame lifted completely and I experienced a freedom that I’d never felt before. I started to realize I’d been wearing someone else’s shame." ...|$|R
6000|$|How I {{longed for}} one hour of Hilda <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> with her almost infallible instinct. I {{realised}} how feeble and fallacious was my own groping in the dark. Her knowledge of temperament would have revealed to her at once what I was trying to discover, like the police she despised, by the clumsy [...] "clues" [...] which so roused her sarcasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} {{do it for a}} less cause," [...] Sir William said; [...] "but the gain may be greater than the risk. So I shall go, Archie, your wise counsel notwithstanding, and you shall journey with me to see that I get not into scrapes, and <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of them should I, in spite of your care, fall into them." ...|$|E
60|$|The rapid {{was strong}} but deep, so that nothing {{obstructed}} me till I reached the lower end, when a rock caught {{my legs and}} threw me into a horizontal position, with the rod flat on the water. I was thrown against the bank, where my Norwegian boy was standing mouth open, eyes blazing, and hand extended <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Harper {{dedicated}} {{the single}} {{to the memory}} of Ali Hader VC, of the 6th/13th Frontier Force Rifles, Indian Army (Pakistan). [...] "...who <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of a bit of a jam with Adolf in '45...".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, is that so!" [...] {{returned}} Barton Pelter, {{and put out}} his hand. [...] "I am glad to see you," [...] he continued, somewhat hesitatingly. [...] "Is {{this the}} one who <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> pull <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of the river?" [...] and he nodded towards Sam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I've done it before," [...] she laughed, as {{she read}} his wonder, with his gratitude, in his eyes. [...] "The horse was already stiff, and you were nearly so, by the time I came {{up to you and}} got"--she laughed again--"the OTHER Chinaman <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> pull you <b>out</b> of that hole." ...|$|R
60|$|Harry. That's just it. (Leans {{back against}} post again.) Hard luck. (Insinuating.) But {{there was never}} a time in all my travels that a woman of the right sort did not turn up <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of a fix. I don't know why. It's perhaps because they know without telling that I love them all. (Playful.) I've almost fallen in love with you, Miss Bessie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along!" [...] {{cried the}} colonel. [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of this scrape. I'm {{going to leave}} that hotel as soon as I can put my things together, and you've got to browbeat the {{landlord}} for me while I go up and reassure my wife {{long enough to get}} her out of that den of thieves. What did you say the scoundrelly name was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Feel!" [...] {{echoed the}} hunter, [...] "it felt as bad, or wuss, nor {{the time that}} grizzly bar up the Yellowstone River got his claws into the small o' my back--only I hadn't you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> o' the {{difficulty}} this time. I {{had to do it}} all myself, Jacob, and hard work it was, I tell 'ee, boy. Hows'ever, it's all over now, an' we're to be spliced this evenin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had it {{engraved}} in script type on {{a visiting}} card {{and looked at}} it daily, maybe I would be able to remember it," [...] answered Tom, mournfully. [...] "You know my head was never very good for history or anything like that. However, now that I know that your name is Philander Tubblets Williams, don't you think you'd like to ride down to Ashton with us? We {{are going to have a}} little spread to-night, and I want you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> pick <b>out</b> the spaghetti, sauerkraut, sweet potato pie, Limburger cheese, and other delicacies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Macumazana," [...] he exclaimed, weeping in his terror, [...] "O Macumazana, if ever I {{have been}} a friend <b>to</b> you, <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of this deep pit into which I have fallen through the tricks of that monkey of a {{daughter}} of mine, who I think is a witch born to bring trouble upon men. Macumazahn, {{if she had been}} your daughter and a powerful chief had appeared with a hundred and twenty head of such beautiful cattle, you would have given her to him, would you not, although he is of mixed blood and not very young, especially as she did not mind who only cares for place and wealth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Elma," [...] Cyril answered, {{with a cold}} thrill, [...] "I {{believe in}} Guy; I think I know myself, and I think I know him, well {{enough to say that}} such a thing as murder is {{impossible}} for either of us. He's weak at times, I admit, and his will was powerless before the magnetic force of Montague Nevitt's. But when I try to face that inscrutable mystery of why, if he's innocent, he has run away from this charge, I confess my faith begins to falter and tremble. He must have seen it in the papers. He must have seen I was accused. What can he mean by leaving me to bear it in his stead without ever coming forward <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> fairly <b>out</b> of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane--stop him--please stop him," [...] gasped Venters. [...] "I've lost my strength. I can't do--anything. This is {{hell for}} me! Can't you see that? I've ruined you--it was through me you lost all. You've only Black Star and Night left. You love these horses. Oh! I {{know how you}} must love them now! And--you're trying to give them to me. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of Utah! To save the girl I love!" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{brother who}} was again engaged by Herne {{to play one}} of the leading parts in Shore Acres was {{beginning}} to see light ahead. His pay was not large but he was saving a little of it and was willing to use his savings <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> in my plan of rescue. It was to be a rescue although we were careful never to put it in that form in our letters to the old pioneer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've bought Uncle Tom's {{old house}} from Peter Townley," [...] he said quietly, [...] "and I want you folks <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> with my plans. Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally ain't {{going to spend}} their golden wedding in the poorhouse--no, sir. They'll spend it {{in their own home}} with their old friends about them. But they're not to know {{anything}} about it till the very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was in it}} all the time; and divil a word he'd say for himself, or Feemy, or his father, or the owld place either; {{but just}} wanted me, Captain, to give it all up to them at once, the ruffians! and when I wouldn't, he went off with Keegan to Carrick. There's my own son joined with 'em agin me; and he'll <b>help</b> <b>to</b> dhrive <b>me</b> <b>out,</b> he will,--and Feemy too, poor girl!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I chose Giorgione {{rather than}} Veronese <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in {{carrying}} <b>out</b> this parallel; because I {{do not find}} in Giorgione's work any of the early Venetian monarchist element. He {{seems to me to}} have belonged more to an abstract contemplative school. I may be wrong in this; it is no matter;--suppose it were so, and that he came down to Venice somewhat recusant, or insentient, concerning the usual priestly doctrines of his day,--how would the Venetian religion, from an outer intellectual standing-point, have looked to him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget, Tolly, that {{my father}} knows every inch of these woods and plains for at least fifty miles round the old house they have blown up; and, as to waking you, {{it would have been}} next to {{impossible}} to have done so, you were so tired, and you would have been quite unable to keep your eyes open. Besides, I had a little plan of my own which I want you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>out.</b> Go on with your breakfast and I'll explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "And I can {{say that}} I sent it at your suggestion, and then, instead of trying <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of the awful, awful--box, you took a cruel {{pleasure}} in teasing me about it! But I shall not say anything, for I shall not see them. I will leave you to receive them and {{make the best of}} it. Don't try to stop me, Willis." [...] She threatens him with her fan as he steps forward to intercept her escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{not your}} dollars, but mine, Shorty. It's a deal I have on. What I'm after is to corner every blessed egg in Dawson, in the Klondike, on the Yukon. You've got <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> I haven't {{the time to}} tell you of the inwardness of the deal. I will afterward, and let you go half on {{it if you want}} to. But the thing right now is to get the eggs. Now you hustle up to Slavovitch's and buy all he's got." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, he run on, and on, and on, {{making up}} stuff about Hicksville and {{everybody}} in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how this was going <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, {{he reached over and}} kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off {{with the back of her}} hand, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|And then, {{without a}} moment's warning, {{the fire of}} indignation which had leaped up <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{suddenly}} died <b>out.</b> He was standing respectfully away from me, pale and dignified. His face was full of emotion, and his hands were trembling; but some instinct seemed to have told him how I hated his touch, {{and he did not}} attempt even to hold my hand. Oh! that moment, terrible as it was at the time, will be very sweet to think upon in after days.|$|R
30|$|Sixth, we {{attempted}} to use simple and natural language, repeated nouns instead of using pronouns to avoid vague referents, and used specific rather than general terms. On the contrary, we avoided elements that could be ambiguous, negative constructions, questions that ask two questions in one, as well as metaphors. Additionally, we tried not to word the question {{in a way that}} it suggested that the behaviour was rather common. We also abstained from including reasons that explained the behaviour, as we consider, for instance, that the question “Watch speakers’ gestures and general body language <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> figure <b>out</b> the meaning of what they are saying” (Cohen, Oxford, and Chi, 2002) is too explicit and, as a consequence, it may influence students’ responses due to the tendency pointed out by Bakan (1954) to supply socially acceptable data.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> find <b>out</b> {{what has made}} the {{darkness}} of the women. Gray darkness and shadowy trees. We're all in it, ten million women, young married women with good prosperous husbands, and business women in linen collars, and grandmothers that gad out to teas, and wives of under-paid miners, and farmwives who really like to make butter and go to church. What is it we want--and need? Will Kennicott there would say that we need lots of children and hard work. But it isn't that. There's the same discontent in women with eight children and one more coming--always one more coming! And you find it in stenographers and wives who scrub, just as much as in girl college-graduates who wonder how they can escape their kind parents. What do we want?" ...|$|R
