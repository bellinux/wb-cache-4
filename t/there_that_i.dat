Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.

500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him.

500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he {{was always in the}} shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains".

[...] Only lead single [...] "Tattoo" [...] contains a synthesizer, which was played by Roth. Two other songs, [...] "You and Your Blues" [...] and [...] "As Is", have a processed guitar that sounds like a synth. Roth also performs acoustic guitar on the intro for [...] "Stay Frosty"—a song that he had written which was re-arranged by Wolfgang. Among the effects units used by Eddie on the album were his signature model MXR Phase 90, a Whammy pedal, and a Wah-wah pedal.

[...] "There's some songs on <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love, {{but for the most part}} it was disconnected," [...] Barker recalled. [...] "It was like, 'You do this part in your studio, and then you're gonna play on it and send it back to me.'

500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in <b>there</b> ... <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} casting, Watanabe {{considered}} Kōichi Yamadera to be [...] "really perfect" [...] for Spike. The staff had him audition as a formality, but Watanabe felt that [...] "no {{matter how you}} looked at it, there was only Yamadera". After a decade of work in anime series, Yamadera was pleased to secure his first leading role, but Unshō Ishizuka, Jet's voice actor, was surprised that Yamadera was not cast as Jet. The two characters were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. Spike's English voice actor, Steven Blum, used film noir imagery to get himself in the right frame of mind to voice the character, but experienced some difficulty portraying in scenes where he was showing vulnerability. Reflecting on his performance, Blum said [...] "there were a few lines here and <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt were awkward, and could have been smoothed out better." [...] He called Spike an [...] "example of a character [...] didn't fully appreciate until the series was over", adding {{that he would like}} to reprise his role as the character if given the chance. Spike's portrayal was expanded in [...] Specifically, according to Yamadera, the character displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series. This was because the team had more time available to express such details. Blum found his performance in the movie one of his most difficult from an emotional standpoint, as there were scenes where Spike was portrayed quite differently from the version he had been playing in the series.|$|E

[...] Halvorssen performed his duties well, deciding to use his worldwide contacts and intelligence connections to detail the extent of Venezuela's role in the drug world.
