25|$|<b>The</b> <b>parables</b> of Jesus {{represent}} {{a major component}} of his teachings in the gospels, <b>the</b> approximately thirty <b>parables</b> forming about one third of his recorded teachings. <b>The</b> <b>parables</b> may appear within longer sermons, as well as other places within <b>the</b> narrative. Jesus' <b>parables</b> are seemingly simple and memorable stories, often with imagery, and each conveys a teaching which usually relates the physical world to the spiritual world.|$|R

5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>parable</b> {{has been}} used to {{illustrate}} a range of truths and fallacies; broadly, <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields where there is a deficit or inaccessibility of information, the need for communication, and respect for different perspectives.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for interpreting <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> of Jesus. <b>The</b> methodology put forward has as starting point two convictions. Firstly, {{the difference between}} the context of Jesus’ parables as told by Jesus the Galilean in 30 CE and the literary context of <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> in <b>the</b> gospels has to be taken seriously. Secondly, an effort has to be made to at least try to avoid the fallacies of ethnocentrism and anachronism when interpreting <b>the</b> <b>parables.</b> In an effort to achieve this goal it is argued that social-scientific criticism presents itself as the obvious line of approach. Operating from these two convictions, the method being proposed is explained by using 12 statements (or theses) which are discussed as concisely and comprehensively as possible. It is inter alia argued that the central theme of Jesus’ <b>parables</b> was <b>the</b> non-apocalyptic kingdom of God, that <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> are atypical stories (comparisons), and that <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> depict Jesus as a social prophet.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parable</b> of the Prodigal Son {{is also a}} {{recurring}} theme {{in the works of}} Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> in a different way to the conventional reading. His version of <b>the</b> <b>parable</b> was not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family; the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned.|$|E

5000|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>Parables</b> {{were written}} {{with the aim}} of teaching, Todd Parker claims that <b>the</b> <b>Parables,</b> and <b>the</b> other {{religious}} works of Christopher Smart, are part of his final push for the [...] "evangelization of London's reading public." [...] Even if they were not spreading an [...] "evangelical" [...] message, the books were still intended to promote proper conduct. In addition to teaching Christianity, <b>the</b> <b>parables</b> are set up against the interpretations of Bible held by the Roman Catholic Church and against the Roman Church itself.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{examination}} of influence of <b>the</b> <b>Parables</b> of Enoch on the oldest Jesus traditions.

This motive is a figure of the Son of Man, which is important for both of compared materials.

25|$|In addition, some Christian {{authors have}} argued that this typological {{interpretation}} finds its origin in the speech of Saint Stephen in Acts , {{as well as the}} Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> of the Wicked Tenants and <b>the</b> <b>Parable</b> of the Prodigal Son.|$|E
