5|$|In June 2008, three senior health {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame. Detractors pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.|$|E
40|$|Flexibility of <b>the</b> LHC <b>optics</b> at top {{energy has}} been studied, {{in terms of}} {{betatron}} tune tunability, mainly for <b>the</b> high-beta <b>optics</b> that requires tunability {{of the order of}} half a unit. It has been shown that the tunability at top energy is good enough for <b>the</b> high-beta <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> results obtained in this study could be useful for other optics and operation modes...|$|R
40|$|Tight {{tolerances}} in <b>the</b> LHC require <b>optics</b> measurement {{with very}} good accuracy. Therefore, AC dipoles are em-ployed {{as the primary}} devices to measure <b>the</b> LHC <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> {{accuracy of the measurement}} is mainly determined by the length of the coherent signal, signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement, and the data processing to effectively sup-press the noise. This paper presents numerical and exper-imental studies of how these factors affect the accuracy of <b>the</b> LHC <b>optics</b> measurement using <b>the</b> AC dipoles...|$|R
40|$|A new optics was {{introduced}} in the SPS for improving beam stability at high intensity. For transferring the beam to the LHC, the extraction bumps, extraction kickers and transfer lines needed to be adapted to <b>the</b> new <b>optics.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> transfer lines were re-matched and re-commissioned with <b>the</b> new <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> first operational results are discussed for the SPS extraction, the transfer lines and the LHC injection.

5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Space telescopes were {{proposed}} {{as early as}} 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s, with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the Challenger disaster (1986). When finally launched in 1990, Hubble's main mirror {{was found to have}} been ground incorrectly, compromising the telescope's capabilities. <b>The</b> <b>optics</b> were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} describes <b>the</b> preliminary <b>optics</b> for <b>the</b> experimental insertion region, {{presented in}} the form of lattice files to provide a baseline for studying radiation effects, machine detector interface and beam-beam interactions as well as an optimised design for a smooth transit from injection to collision <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> lattice files are kept in a repository together with <b>the</b> arc <b>optics</b> files...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the errors}} {{in all kinds}} of {{components}} of storage ring, <b>the</b> real ring <b>optics</b> is different from the design one. A computer code LOCO was developed at SLAC to calibrate <b>the</b> linear <b>optics</b> based on <b>the</b> closed orbit response matrix. This paper discusses mainly on the procedure and results of optics correction at BEPCII BPR. Using LOCO, we determined the errors of quadrupole strengths, BPM gains and corrector kicks, and found the quadrupole strengths that best restore <b>the</b> design <b>optics</b> with sextupoles on. Optics measurement after correction shows <b>the</b> real <b>optics</b> agrees well with the design one...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> beam <b>optics</b> in {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} may be changed significantly by {{variations in the}} energy and energy spread profile along the linac. In particular, diurnal temperature swings in the SLC klystron gallery perturb the phase and amplitude of the accelerating RF fields. If such changes are not correctly characterized, the resulting errors will cause phase advance differences in <b>the</b> beam <b>optics.</b> In addition RF phase errors also affect the amplitude growth of betatron oscillations. The authors present an automated, simple procedure to monitor <b>the</b> beam <b>optics</b> in <b>the</b> SLC linac routinely and non-invasively. The measured phase advance and oscillation amplitude is shown {{as a function of}} time and is compared to <b>the</b> nominal <b>optics...</b>|$|R
5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. <b>The</b> <b>optics</b> brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E
5|$|Once the Space Telescope {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing <b>the</b> <b>Optics</b> convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{freeform}} optics {{has been}} more widespread. It is difficult to evaluate the optical performance of <b>the</b> freeform <b>optics</b> due to its geometrical complexity. This paper presents a novel method named Optical-Geometrical Feature Based Method (OGFM) for the characterization of freeform <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> method attempts to establish {{the relationship between the}} geometrical features of freeform surfaces (e. g. the surface roughness and form error) and their corresponding optical performance. Hence, the optical performance of <b>the</b> freeform <b>optics</b> can be evaluated by the measurement of the geometrical features which is relative easy to be carried out as compared to the optical performance tests conducted in automotive lighting systems. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted on <b>the</b> freeform <b>optics</b> in an automotive lighting system. The results show that the geometrical errors in micrometer scale appear not to have significant effect on the optical performance of <b>the</b> freeform <b>optics.</b> However, <b>the</b> optical performance is adversely affected when the geometrical form error increases from more than tens of micrometers scale to sub-millimeters scale. The successful development of the proposed OGFM provides an important means for the optimization of manufacturing tolerance, the selection of appropriate optics manufacturing process, and the evaluation of the optical performance evaluation of <b>the</b> freeform <b>optics.</b> Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
5|$|AMX-30 {{production}} {{occurred at}} the Atelier de Construction de Roanne {{in the town of}} Roanne. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the Atelier de Construction de Limoges, the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire, the turret by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes, the cannon by the Atelier de Construction de Bourges, the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> by the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

40|$|A three stage passive cooler {{for use in}} a {{spacecraft}} for cooling an infra-red detector includes a detector mounting cold plate for mounting the detector directly to <b>the</b> telescope <b>optics.</b> <b>The</b> telescope <b>optics</b> collect and direct the infra-red radiation from the earth, for example, to the infra-red detector, and are mounted directly to the spacecraft. The remaining stages of the cooler are mounted with thermal insulators {{to each other and to}} the spacecraft at separate locations from the detector mounting cold plate...|$|R
50|$|Astigmatism, {{whether it}} is regular or irregular, is caused by some {{combination}} of external (corneal surface) and internal (posterior corneal surface, human lens, fluids, retina, and eye-brain interface) optical properties. In some people, <b>the</b> external <b>optics</b> may have <b>the</b> greater influence, and in other people, <b>the</b> internal <b>optics</b> may predominate. Importantly, the axes and magnitudes of external and internal astigmatism do not necessarily coincide, {{but it is the}} combination of the two that by definition determines <b>the</b> overall <b>optics</b> of <b>the</b> eye. <b>The</b> overall <b>optics</b> of <b>the</b> eye are typically expressed by a person's refraction; the contribution of the external (anterior corneal) astigmatism is measured through the use of techniques such as keratometry and corneal topography. One method analyzes vectors for planning refractive surgery such that the surgery is apportioned optimally between both the refractive and topographic components.|$|R
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is an {{important}} supplier of defence equipment and technology. A Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bridgwater was built {{at the start of}} the Second World War, between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington, to manufacture explosives. The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater Systems, and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which became part of Thales Optics. It has been announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics' Taunton site, but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions. Other high-technology companies include <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> company Gooch and Housego, at Ilminster. There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath, and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines. The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton, is one of Britain's two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy's Lynx helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando Westland Sea Kings. Around 1,675 service and 2,000 civilian personnel are stationed at Yeovilton and key activities include training of aircrew and engineers and the Royal Navy's Fighter Controllers and surface-based aircraft controllers.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of <b>the</b> <b>optics</b> for his telescopes. In late 1668 {{he was able to}} produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
