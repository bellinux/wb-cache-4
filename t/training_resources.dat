5|$|The Canadian Cadet Movement is {{sponsored}} by the CF/DND and the civilian Air Cadet League, along with the Navy League and Army Cadet League. Each cadet unit is supported by a local Squadron Sponsoring Committee responsible to the National League through each of the Provincial Committees. The basic Air Cadet program is provided at no cost, including uniforms and activities. Most Air Cadet squadrons are sponsored by a local service organization or club such as a Royal Canadian Legion Branch, Royal Canadian Air Force Association Wing, Rotary Club, Lions Club, or a locally established committee. The local civilian sponsors must raise money to provide for accommodation, utilities, liability insurance, local awards, and additional <b>training</b> <b>resources</b> or special activities, such as mess dinners, band instruments or squadron excursions and trips, not funded by the CF/DND.
