25|$|Princess Anne's Battery was staffed and {{operational}} {{into the early}} 1980s. Since then, the guns have been decommissioned and have sustained <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> and vandalism. Accordingly, security measures now prevent {{easy access to the}} site, which is not routinely open to the public. Rather, access is arranged through the Gibraltar Tourist Board. At the turn of the twenty-first century, it was proposed that the area be developed as a tourist attraction. While improvements were made to the area, ultimately opposition to the suggestion put the plans on hold. The guns have recently been refurbished. The restoration of gun No. 3 at Princess Anne's Battery was performed in two phases, in July 2006 and September 2007. The 2006 refurbishment was undertaken by members of the 106 (Yeomanry) Regiment of the Royal Artillery during exercise Marble Tor 5. The 2007 restoration was performed by the 101 Battalion of the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (Volunteers) during exercise Marble Tor 6.|$|E

25|$|The Trafalgar Campaign was a {{long and}} {{complicated}} series of fleet manoeuvres {{carried out by the}} combined French and Spanish fleets; and the opposing moves of the Royal Navy during much of 1805. These were the culmination of French plans to force a passage through the English Channel, and so achieve a successful invasion of the United Kingdom. The plans were extremely complicated and proved to be impractical. Much of the detail was due to the personal intervention of Napoleon, who as a soldier rather than a sailor failed to consider <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather,</b> difficulties in communication, and the Royal Navy. Despite limited successes in achieving some elements of the plan the French commanders were unable to follow the main objective through to execution. The campaign, which took place over thousands of miles of ocean, was marked by several naval engagements, most significantly at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, where the combined fleet was decisively defeated, and from which the campaign takes its name. A final mopping up action at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November completed the destruction of the combined fleet, and secured the supremacy of the Royal Navy at sea.|$|E

Perhaps the fact was that, besides her strong affection for Averil, she felt that in her ignorance she had assisted her father in unscrupulously involving them in a hazardous and unsuccessful speculation, and that she was the more bound, in justice as well as in love and pity, to do her best for their assistance.

The aim of this paper is to broaden the research on weather and crime to consider <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> parameters on <b>the</b> spatial arrangement of crime within an urban area of the UK. A novel combination of techniques that are capable of both evaluating statistically and visualising geographically <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> variables on <b>the</b> incidence of one type of crime, namely calls for police service for disorder or disturbances, is presented. These techniques are examined in relation to the theories that have traditionally been put forward to explain such tends. We conclude that, in our study area, both temperature and humidity exert significant <b>effects</b> on <b>the</b> spatial patterning of incidents of disorder or disturbances. Rainfall, wind speed and wind direction were found not to have a significant effect for this type of call for servce. More research is needed to see how transferable these findings are to other geographical areas with different climatic regimes...|$|R

40|$|In the paper, the {{development}} of an expansive residual clay soil profile weathering from a Permian mudstone is described. The characteristics considered include soil mineralogy, soil chemistry, soil texture and engineering parameters including expansive potential. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> are shown to be most evident in {{the development}} of a series of texturally distinct soil horizons. It is shown that the chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the parent mudstone are very similar to those of its derived expansive clay soils, even though the expansive potential in the clay soil is almost twice as great as in the parent mudstone. The origins of an enhanced expansive potential in the B horizon are explored, and it is found that, for the <b>weathering</b> <b>of</b> a mudstone in a temperate climate, <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> on structure are more important than <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> on mineralogy. It is concluded that most of the smectite clays in the weathered clay soils were inherited from the parent mudstone (with little or no transformation) and that these clay components were likely to have been present in the sediments from which the mudstone formed. The enhanced expansive potential in the residual clays is attributed to <b>the</b> physical <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> in breaking down structure and/or bonding in the parent rock, which reduces the potential expansiveness of the clays contained in the parent rock. This proposal is supported by experimental evidence...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{utilities}} require short-term {{forecasts of}} electricity demand (load) {{in order to}} schedule generating plant up to several days ahead on an hourly basis. Errors in the forecasts may lead to generation plant operation that is not required or sub-optimal scheduling of generation plants. In addition, {{with the introduction of}} the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, a deregulated market structure has been introduced, adding increased impetus to reducing forecast error and the associated costs. This thesis presents a strategy for reducing costs from electrical demand forecast error using models designed specifically for the Irish system. The differences in short-term load forecasting models are examined under three independent categories: how the data is segmented prior to modelling, the modelling technique and the approach taken to minimise <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> forecast errors present in weather inputs to the load forecasting models. A novel approach is presented to determine whether the data should be segmented by hour of the day prior to modelling. Several segmentation strategies are analysed and the one appropriate for Irish data identified. Furthermore, both linear and nonlinear techniques are compared with a view to evaluating the optimal model type. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> forecast errors on load forecasting models, though significant, has largely been ignored in the literature. Thus, the underlying issues are examined and a novel method is presented which minimises <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>weather</b> forecast errors. ...|$|R
