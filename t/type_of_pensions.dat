This suggested the federal and provincial governments would have to agree {{to the creation of a}} pension to which judges must contribute. Dickson refuted this argument by saying the general effect of the section 92(14) is limited by other more specific parts of the Constitution, in this case section 100. [...] Another interpretation of section 100 was that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> it mentioned was the kind that existed at the time of Canadian Confederation, i.e. pensions to which judges did not contribute. Moreover, the section's requirement that Parliament provides the pension could be taken as meaning Parliament alone; the section did not say judges along with Parliament had the responsibility. [...] Dickson rejected the idea that the type of pension had to be the same as it was at Confederation in 1867, because the Constitution is meant to adapt to changing circumstances. This was the living tree doctrine. [...] As for the notion that Parliament alone must pay for the pension, Dickson replied under section 100, Parliament must pay a pension, but section 100 did not say what percentage of a total pension.|$|E

40|$|Individuals are {{increasingly}} {{in charge of}} their own financial security after retirement. But how well-equipped are individuals to make saving decisions; do they possess adequate financial literacy, are they informed about the most important components of saving plans, do they even plan for retirement? This paper shows that financial illiteracy is widespread among the U. S. population and particularly acute among specific demographic groups, such as those with low education, women, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Moreover, close to half of older workers do not know which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> they have and {{the large majority of}} workers know little about the rules governing Social Security benefits. Notwithstanding the low levels of literacy that many individuals display, very few rely on the help of experts or financial advisors to make saving and investment decisions. Low literacy and lack of information affect the ability to save and to secure a comfortable retirement; ignorance about basic financial concepts can be linked to lack of retirement planning and lack of wealth. Financial education programs can help improve saving and financial decision-making, but much more can be done to improve the effectiveness of these programs. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} thirty years there has been a {{considerable}} change in the way people save for retirement. The once traditional defined benefit plans are steadily being replaced by now dominant defined contribution plans. This shift in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> offered to the worker, can potentially affect job choice and savings decisions. By examining the trade-off that workers face when choosing between compensation in the form of wages versus pension contributions, this paper explores the behavioral effects resulting from changes in the workers ’ environment and the potential impact of policy interventions. I formulate a lifecycle model, in which individuals search for jobs, consume, save on their own and through their employer-provided pension, so as to maximize utility. Job offers are wage-pension packages, consisting of a total compensation component, and a pension plan, which could be defined benefit, defined contribution or neither. Each worker’s job acceptance and rejection decisions is the result of interplay between his preferences and the set of different incentives and risks that each pension plan comes with. The structural model is simulated and will later be estimated using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The estimates of the structural parameters can be used to address a set of policy question such as: How does the shift in pension type coverage impact wage growth and job-to-job transitions? Which compensation packages lead to higher retirement savings...|$|E

Finally, other characteristics are gradually incorporated into the basic model in order to answer whether the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> plans available should be limited exclusively to lifetime annuities, {{as is the case in}} most countries with pay-as-you-go systems and in some coun-tries with capitalization systems, or whether the individual should have some degree of freedom to choose according to his personal circum-stances and preferences...|$|R
30|$|Hence it is {{concluded}} that the fit {{is not good for}} some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefit given that some cohorts are over or underrepresented in the CSWL with respect to the actual population of pensioners, and contain a number <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> clearly higher or lower than the figure expected depending on the proportion of the reference population represented by the CSWL (4 %). The results seem to suggest that for 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 the CSWL does not fit the distribution of the population well in terms <b>of</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension,</b> gender, and age for two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefit: permanent disability and widowhood. The mismatch is greater in the former, and the poor fit is not attributable solely to the large sample size. In other years the null hypothesis that the CSWL has the same distribution as the population cannot be rejected given the size of the sample, but there is room for improvement in the cases where the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, as will be shown in the next section.|$|R
