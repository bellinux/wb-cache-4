50|$|Shumway {{moved to}} Albany, New York, where {{his first two}} sons were born in 1796 and 1798, {{relocated}} to Schenectady in around 1800, and returned to Albany in 1806. In 1820 he settled in Lyme; after he lost his farm there through a <b>title</b> <b>defect</b> {{a few years later}} he returned to Freehold, where he died in 1843.|$|E
50|$|Not all quiet title actions “clear title” completely. Some {{states have}} a quiet title action {{for the purpose of}} {{clearing}} a particular, known claim, <b>title</b> <b>defect,</b> or perceived defect. Contrast title registration which settles all title issues, both known and unknown. Quiet title actions are always subject to attack and are particularly vulnerable to jurisdictional challenges, both subject matter and personal, even years after final court decree in the action. It usually takes 3-6 months depending on the state where it is done.|$|E
5000|$|A {{warranty}} deed {{is a type}} of deed where the grantor (seller) guarantees that he or she holds clear title to a piece of real estate and has a right to sell it to the grantee (buyer). This is in contrast to a quitclaim deed, where the seller does not guarantee that he or she holds title to a piece of real estate. A general {{warranty deed}} protects the grantee against <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> arising at any point in time, extending back to the property's origins. A special warranty deed protects the grantee only against <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> arising from the actions or omissions of the grantor.|$|R
50|$|The lender {{performs}} a title search {{based on the}} aircraft's registration number, in order to confirm that no liens or <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> are present. In many cases, a title insurance policy is procured to protect against any undetected <b>defects</b> in <b>title.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As stated above, in most jurisdictions {{properties}} sold in {{this manner}} are conveyed {{to the highest bidder}} via [...] "tax deed" [...] (or similarly-named deed), a form of quitclaim deed. Thus, the holder of the tax deed would then have to file a quiet title action, in order to clear any <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> or obtain a mortgage or title insurance.|$|R
5000|$|In United States {{property}} law, cloud on title or <b>title</b> <b>defect</b> {{refers to}} any irregularity {{in the chain}} of title of property (usually real property) that would give a reasonable person pause before accepting a conveyance of title. According to Investopedia, a cloud can be defined as: [...] "Any document, claim, unreleased lien or encumbrance that might invalidate or impair the title to real property or make the title doubtful. Clouds on title are usually discovered during a title search." [...] Clouded title can thus be contrasted with a clear title, which indicates that a property is unencumbered.|$|E
5000|$|Flying freeholds {{are viewed}} as a <b>title</b> <b>defect,</b> because they rarely have {{adequate}} rights {{of support from the}} structure beneath or rights of access to make repairs. [...] This is an issue if, for example, scaffolding needs to be erected on the land beneath the flying freehold: the landowner's consent will be required and he may refuse, or want to charge a premium. If the work is necessary {{it may be possible to}} obtain a court order under the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992, but there are costs and uncertainties involved, and the situation could be even worse if the structure beneath is unregistered land and the identity of the owner is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Most buyers {{perform a}} title search to {{determine}} if there are <b>defects</b> in <b>title</b> that must be resolved before they purchase real property. A title search provides constructive notice of any encumbrances, easements, or restrictions on the property being conveyed, and is generally considered part of a buyer's due diligence in the process of purchasing real estate. Buyers can also purchase title insurance to protect against <b>title</b> <b>defects.</b> A warranty deed is not a substitute for title insurance because, if the grantor later dies or goes bankrupt, the grantee {{may not be able to}} exercise the warranty.|$|R
5000|$|A Landman or [...] "Petroleum Landman"—in the United States and Canada—is an {{individual}} who performs various services {{for oil and gas}} exploration companies. According to the website of the American Association of Professional Landmen (AAPL), these services include but are not limited to: negotiating for the acquisition or divestiture of mineral rights; negotiating business agreements that provide for the exploration and/or development of minerals; determining ownership in minerals through the research of public and private records; reviewing the status of <b>title,</b> curing <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> and otherwise reducing title risk associated with ownership in minerals; managing rights and/or obligations derived from ownership of interests in minerals; and unitizing or pooling of interests in minerals.|$|R

50|$|Holden driver Rod Wilson was {{the inaugural}} series winner. Sydney's Warren Luff, took {{back to back}} {{victories}} in 2002 and 2003. Holden again returned to form in 2004 with Damien White taking the series <b>title,</b> before <b>defecting</b> to Ford and taking the title again in 2005 by a narrow margin to Melbourne's Marcus Zukanovic.|$|R
2500|$|Title {{insurers}} {{conduct a}} title search on public records before {{they agree to}} insure the purchaser or mortgagee of land. [...] Specifically, after a real estate sales contract has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home's title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, {{will be required to}} fix such <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.|$|R
50|$|VR Mode, {{also known}} as Video Recording mode, is a new format that allows editing and {{deleting}} of <b>titles</b> and has <b>defect</b> management. This mode {{is used by the}} DVD-RAM and DVD-RW formats. Because it is newer than DVD Video mode, it can only be played back in more recent DVD players that support it.|$|R
25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of <b>title</b> <b>defects</b> or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or <b>defects</b> in the <b>title</b> to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|R

Abe then enters a transaction with Bo but during the escrow, Bo discovers a flaw in <b>title</b> and several <b>defects.</b> Abe is entitled to discount the price by $20,000 to close the sale with Bo without having to reoffer the house to Carl at $980,000.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This {{paper was}} {{motivated}} {{by the absence of}} a government examination of and professional interest in planning conditions as a means of development control in Hong Kong. Proposes to examine this situation. Design/methodology/approach - The research objective is achieved by a field survey and legal analysis of its findings. The field survey of all the 60 residential development projects in Hong Kong under comprehensive development area zoning subject to conditional planning permissions from 1998 to 2000 involving 119 planning applications was conducted to assess factual compliance with planning conditions. Findings - The findings show that, while most physical planning obligations have been duly fulfilled in these projects, the non-depositing of master layout plans for development poses actual and potential public domain problems of planning enforcement, building permission, conveyancing and property management. The major problems of non-compliance are property purchasers being unable to fully appreciate the environment of a development when making a decision to buy; subsequent <b>titles</b> <b>defects,</b> unauthorised building works and operations. Suggestions are made to close the loopholes in planning law and to introduce a formal channel for retrospective rectification {{in the light of the}} social consequences of non-compliance. Originality/value - This paper is the first serious attempt to evaluate the importance of compliance with planning conditions in Hong Kong and its analysis should be of interest not only to local policy makers and professional people in particular, but also to researchers in comparative development control in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|In 922, Li Cunxu {{claimed the}} title of emperor of a new state of Later Tang. However, at that time, Later Tang was facing {{military}} pressure both from Later Liang and Khitan, and the military food supply and morale were low. At that time, the main Later Liang army was commanded by Dai Siyuan, who also served as the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). He left his officers Lu Shunmi (盧順密), Liu Suiyan (劉遂嚴), and Yan Yong (燕顒) at Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (鄆州) to defend it. Shortly after Li Cunxu's declaration of imperial <b>title,</b> however, Lu <b>defected</b> to Later Tang and revealed that Yun was defended by less than 1,000 soldiers and that Liu and Yan lacked support from the soldiers. He advocated that Later Tang attack it by surprise. As Yun was deep in Later Liang territory south of the Yellow River, however, most of Li Cunxu's generals, including {{his chief of staff}} (Shumishi) Guo Chongtao, opposed Lu's proposal, believing that it would be dangerous and futile. Li Siyuan, however, wanting to repair his relationship with Li Cunxu, offered to command this mission by himself. Li Cunxu agreed, and allowed him to take 5,000 soldiers to, under cover of darkness, rapidly descend on Yun to attack it. Li Siyuan's army managed to evade Later Liang detection, and when they reached Yun, Li Congke led the soldiers in scaling the walls. The city fell to Li Siyuan, who was commissioned the military governor of Tianping and held it for Later Tang {{over the next several months}} as the Later Liang army (by then under the command of Wang Yanzhang) futilely tried to cut off the supply route from Later Tang proper to Yun.|$|R
