5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). <b>The</b> <b>inner</b> membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E
