5|$|A <b>topographic</b> <b>map</b> {{shows that}} the {{majority}} of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its Hiten spacecraft. The spacecraft released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA spacecraft Clementine to lunar orbit. This mission obtained the first near-global <b>topographic</b> <b>map</b> of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface. This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, {{which is likely to}} have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contour line is {{the main}} linear feature on <b>topographic</b> <b>maps.</b> Extraction of contour lines is tedious and {{time-consuming}} process, and is still an interesting problem. A novel method for extraction of contour lines from paper-based <b>topographic</b> <b>maps</b> is presented in this paper. In our approach, we firstly segment color <b>topographic</b> <b>maps</b> for achieving the binary image of brown color contour lines. Then, mathematic morphology method is used to filter the binary image. Next, Utilizing c-means algorithm to look for initial seed point on thinning contour lines. Fourthly, utilizing improved active contour model to extract nonthinning contour lines. Last, we have analyzed the directional field of contour lines near the gap, and then reconnected broken contour lines. The performance of the algorithm is tested on several <b>topographic</b> <b>maps</b> and comparing with other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|<b>Topographic</b> <b>maps</b> {{show the}} general {{configuration}} of the land surface, including its relief and the position of natural and man-made features. The configuration is shown commonly by contour lines, imaginary lines connecting all points of equal elevation on the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface above or below a datum plane such as mean sea level. When the land slope is steeper the contour lines are closer together. <b>Topographic</b> <b>maps</b> at scales of one inch to a mile or greater (shown as 1 : 63, 360 on the map) are used in many ways. They are particularly important in preparation of various types of geologic maps and cross sections {{that can be used}} in locating, for example, mineral resources or aquifers. Explorations of the geology and natural resources of the American West were initiated by the King, Wheeler, Hayden, and Powell Surveys from 1867 to 1879, but major <b>topographic</b> <b>mapping</b> efforts began only after 1881. In December 1885 John Wesley Powell, second director of the U. S. Geological Survey, testified before a joint committee of Congress about the national need for <b>topographic</b> <b>maps</b> of the country. He said that <b>topographic</b> <b>mapping</b> of the country could be completed in twenty-four years.
