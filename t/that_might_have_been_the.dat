25|$|The {{subsequent}} sources emphasized on the Sasanians' {{hatred of}} everything {{adapted from the}} Parthians. The existence of such a mentality in Ardashir is understandable; but even {{he was forced to}} establish his newborn government on Parthian foundations by the help of other remarkable Iranian houses, who were either affiliated with the Parthians or nursed by them. However, no change is seen in that hatred of the Parthians in the next generations of Sasanian emperors either. Therefor, it can be deduced that the Parthians enforced a more hard and tyrannical domination than presumed on their submitted shahs and <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> reason that facilitated Ardashir's conquest.|$|E

They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized that I {{wanted to be a}} rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't {{be able to do that}} if I was in Zappa's band." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurice Hurley {{was pleased}} with the outcome of the episode, saying [...] "The sets, the design of it and the look of that show was brilliant, I thought <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> best-looking show of the first season". However, he felt that the characterisations weren't quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data's actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He {{was the only one of}} the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like [...] "a break dancer doing the Robot" [...] whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that [...] "I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got cranked up to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much everyone wanted to deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa." [...] The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode [...] "Silicon Avatar". Brent Spiner reprised the role of Lore in the episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "".|$|E
