40|$|For the {{realization}} of DC-DC converters in automotive industry, the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter {{seems to be a}} promising choice because of its soft-switching and high-power-density capability. Contrary to the traditional 3 level - 3 level (3 - 3 L) DAB, a 3 level - 5 level (3 - 5 L) DAB can operate under soft-switching and lower RMS inductor current. For this reason, a fair comparison is needed among the 3 - 3 L DAB and two possible implementations of the 3 - 5 L DAB, which utilize a <b>T-Type</b> <b>bridge</b> leg (3 - 5 L-T DAB) or an NPC bridge leg (3 - 5 L-NPC DAB) in the secondary bridge. In this paper, a comparative evaluation of the aforementioned Dual Active Bridge DC-DC converter variants is presented. The advantages and drawbacks of each concept are discussed in detail, focusing on the semiconductor chip area utilization and the impact on the converter efficiency. Furthermore, the analytical models allow a power density comparison, by correlating the component losses with their volume...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) modulation {{strategy for the}} 3 Level [...] 5 Level (3 - 5 L) Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC [...] DC converter. The DAB accommodates a full bridge in the primary side and two 3 -level <b>T-Type</b> <b>bridge</b> legs in the secondary side, linked by a high-frequency transformer and an inductor. A ZVS modulation strategy is presented, in which commutation inductances are utilized to extend the ZVS region to the entire operating range of the converter. The configuration of the secondary-side bridge allows further flexibility, compared to a full bridge configuration, to minimize the current in the inductor. The nominal power of the converter is 2. 8 kW with input voltage range from 8 V to 16 V, and output voltage range from 175 V to 450 V. The currents of the are {{compared with those of}} a typical 3 - 3 L full bridge - full bridge DAB, by applying the proposed modulation strategy in the, and a strategy proposed in literature in the 3 - 3 L DAB...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} half century, large numbers of simply {{supported}} bridges were constructed in China; however, {{with the passing of}} years and the increase in the volume of transport, many of the bridges are out of normal service level and even gradually lose their bearing capacity due to overload or environmental influence. Therefore, some strengthening works have to be carried out in order for these old bridges to work well. Among the common strengthening methods, an efficient way to transform a simply supported into a continuous system is widely used in simply supported bridges with small or medium span. After the transformation of the system, the internal forces in the bridge are redistributed. This paper investigated, using the FEM software ANSYS, both the endogen forces of an old <b>T-type</b> <b>bridge</b> transformed from a simply supported to a continuous system under vehicular load. The result of the analysis indicates that the flexural moments in mid-span of all lateral T beams are significantly decreased and negative moments at supports are formed, while the shear forces in controlling sections are increased that are required to be reinforced based on the computation. In addition, after transformation, both longitudinal and lateral stiffnesses of T beams are improved that provides beneficial effects on the deflections of the bridge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{application}} of diode <b>bridge</b> <b>T-type</b> LC reactor as the transient suppressor for distribution transformer is presented. The proposed transient suppressor {{is effective in}} reducing the peak overvoltage and voltage steepness {{by a factor of}} two. The transient suppressor is connected to the upstream of the protected transformer to mitigate transients induced by lightning. The approach developed enables one to construct a simple and low cost transient suppressor with negligible effects on the systems steady state operation. The proposed transient suppressor is numerically tested using simulation package PSCAD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRotation {{construction}} of a bridge is an effective construction method, when a bridge across the highway, railway, river, canyon, or other special conditions such as existing building. First of all, beams are manufactured to the shore, or on side of the existing building, or {{on both sides of}} the existing traffic routes, and then beam is rotated to the design location along the spin axis. <b>T-type</b> rigid frame <b>bridge</b> is a cantilever beam after removing of the supporting; and its overall stability depends on the ball joints in the event of rotational friction and the support feet. From a structural point of view, the bending moment at the free end of cantilever is zero, while the largest at the root. The force system of the structure is changing during removal of the supporting. On-site monitoring of deformation process was carried out to master the development of the deformation. Numerical calculation of Ttype rigid frame bridge was carried out to simulate the supporting-removal process of bridge construction, and then deformation at some key sections was obtained. Some conclusions are obtained to give reference for construction and controlling of the bridge...|$|R
