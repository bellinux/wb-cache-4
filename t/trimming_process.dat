25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place.

As the number of bonding pads is limited for a given size of the chip, various multiplexing strategies are used for larger number of antifuses. In some cases a combined circuit with zeners and transistors can be used to form a zapping matrix; with additional zeners, the trimming (which uses voltages higher than the normal operational voltage of the chip) can be performed even after packaging the chip.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) Coherent Change Detection (CCD) {{has been found to}} be of great utility in detecting changes that occur on the ground. The CCD procedure involves performing repeat pass radar collections to form a coherence product, where ground disturbances can induce detectable incoherence. However there is always a difference in the radar collection geometry which can lead to incoherent energy noise entering the CCD. When sensing flat terrain in a far-field regime, the incoherence due to collection geometry difference can be removed through a conventional global Fourier image support <b>trimming</b> <b>process.</b> However, it has been found that when the terrain is either in a near-field regime or contains non-flat topography, the optimal <b>trimming</b> <b>process</b> is substantially more involved, so much so that a new per-pixel SAR back-projection imaging algorithm has been developed.

This paper mainly focuses on the special location issues in the digital and flexible <b>trimming</b> <b>process</b> for aircraft skins fastened by reconfigurable fixture. Firstly, {{in view of the}} dynamic change of effective locators, the “X- 2 - 1 ” location principle was proposed with reference to the “ 3 - 2 - 1 ” and “N- 2 - 1 ” location schemes. Secondly, the standard procedure for solving location parameters was summarized in consideration of location admissibility, holding posture, locator layout and so on. Thirdly, a locating experiment was conducted to investigate the positional accuracy of the reconfigurable fixture and the calculation accuracy of location parameters solution.

40|$|The {{selection}} of materials for an engineering component is not only requested by its design function and shape, but also the sequence through which it is manufactured. The manufacturing operation of roller chains involves drawing and <b>trimming</b> <b>processes</b> aimed at producing semi-finished chain drives component with a well-standardized dimension. In addition to final combination of properties required by design constraints, the ability of materials to be formed into a desired shape and geometry without failure is also critical.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{to correctly}} couple a time-accurate free wake model to a flight dynamics sim-ulation was investigated. The simulation {{model is a}} coupled rotor-fuselage model with flexible blade modelling in flap, lag and torsion. Two free wake models capable of capturing correctly the wake ge-ometry distortions during maneuvering flight were used, a relaxation or iterative free wake model and a time-marching free wake model. The assumptions and limitations of these models make the first suit-able for steady flight conditions, while the second can model unsteady maneuvers. To be able to de-termine the transient response to of arbitrary am-plitude maneuvers with a time-accurate free wake model accurately, a two-phase <b>trim</b> <b>process</b> is nec-essary. This process consists of an initial trim with the relaxation free wake model and a conver-gence phase to obtain the equivalent geometry with the time-marching free wake, but free of numerical transients. The approach was investigated in low speed straight flight and steady turns. The results indicate that for hover and very low speeds the two models produce very similar geometries and almost identical induced velocities. For higher transition speeds and for turns at a high load factor, however, {{the differences in the}} geometry between the relax-ation and the time-marching models, in particula...|$|R
40|$|An adjoint-based Trim-Corrected Optimization Strategy (TCOS) {{with active}} engines is {{presented}} with applications to a three-dimensional modern transport aircraft configuration. The airframe drag is minimized using a gradient-based optimization algorithm by adapting the shape parameters alone while a <b>trim</b> <b>process</b> guarantees {{by means of}} the trim parameters that the design satisfies the aircrafts steady-state equilibrium of forces and moments. Following this approach, the sensitivity of the objective function is corrected in order to be consistent with the trim constraints. The backbone of the design evaluation process is the HPC-based environment FlowSimulator allowing for an in-memory data exchange between the involved primal tools and their dual counterparts. These are a freeform deformation parametrization, a mesh deformation method based on the linear elasticity analogy preserving the fuselage shape during the horizontal tail plane deflection and the finite-volume RANS solver TAU including the numerical engine treatment and a fully differentiated discrete-adjoint implementation. Several optimization studies were performed to quantify the impact of an active and controlled engine on the optimization result, but also to compare the TCOS performance against that of a conventional gradient-based Direct Optimization Strategy (DOS) in which the trim constraints and parameters are explicitly handled by the optimization algorithm. TCOS was found to achieve similar overall drag reductions as DOS. However, TCOS was able to significantly reduce the drag during the first few iterations while resulting in a feasible design in every optimization iteration...|$|R
