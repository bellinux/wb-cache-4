5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) leave the office to buy a condo. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), along with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), organizes office games and gets his co-workers <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E
60|$|Yes: little fogs were {{in every}} hollow, Though the purple {{hillocks}} enjoyed fine weather, When we went <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> church together, And carried 'em there in an after year.|$|R
5000|$|O.G. Style's {{debut album}} I Know How <b>To</b> <b>Play</b> <b>'Em!</b> {{was one of}} the Rap-A-Lot Records {{earliest}} full-lengths, which was dropped in 1991. It featured the single [...] "Catch 'Em Slippin'", released in 1990.|$|R
50|$|I Know How <b>To</b> <b>Play</b> <b>'Em!</b> {{is the one}} {{and only}} album by American hip hop {{recording}} artists Eric 'Original E' Woods and DJ Big Boss, released as a duo O.G. Style from Houston, Texas. It was peaked at #69 on Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.|$|R

25|$|Non-iPhone {{users were}} found to be {{watching}} and downloading streams intended for iPhone users allowing them <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> on alternative devices. The BBC modified the iPlayer service on 13 March 2008 to prevent this.|$|E
25|$|A McCain-Palin {{spokesperson}} responded {{saying that}} the campaign had properly licensed these songs giving them to permission <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them.</b> The music has reportedly been used under blanket licensing, which {{does not require the}} artists' permission but still follows proper legal channels and includes royalty payments.|$|E

25|$|When the Marylebone Cricket Club toured Australia in 1907/08, Moysey {{was picked}} in the Western Australian team <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> at the WACA Ground. Facing an attack that {{consisted}} of English Test players, the left handed batsman was bowled by Jack Crawford for eight in the first innings and dismissed by Wilfred Rhodes in his second innings.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the disc}} records, and the {{machines}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them,</b> were cheaper to mass-produce than {{the products of}} the cylinder system. Disc records were also easier and cheaper to store in bulk, as they could be stacked, or when in paper sleeves put in rows on shelves like books—packed together more densely than cylinder recordings.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1900s, calliopes {{began using}} music rolls {{instead of a}} live musician. The music roll {{operated}} {{in a similar manner}} to a piano roll in a player piano, mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.|$|E

In 2004, Woods dropped Return Of Da Game via Hard Edge Entertainment.|$|R

25|$|The {{finding of}} good Gold in the Mines could {{sometimes}} cause the Club to renege on their obligations. On one occasion in the 1890s, {{a party of}} gentlemen from the Croydon Club came riding into town and claimed that they had arranged a match against the Warrandyte Club {{and there was no}} one <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them.</b> They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised to them in the local press, but they never came back until 1910.|$|E
25|$|The aggressions {{of the two}} Ostrogothic leaders, Theoderic the Amal (Theoderic the Great), the son of Theodemir {{and leader}} of the Moesian Ostrogoths, and Theodoric Strabo, the leader of the Thracian Ostrogoths, had been a {{constant}} source of danger since 472. Although Zeno at times contrived <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> off against each other, they in turn were able to profit by his dynastic rivalries. It was only by offering them pay and high command that he kept them from attacking Constantinople itself.|$|E
25|$|Despite the name, {{keyboard}} percussion instruments do {{not have}} keyboards as such. Keyboard instruments such as the celesta and keyboard glockenspiel {{are not included in}} the percussion section owing to the very different skills required <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them,</b> but instead are grouped in the keyboard section with instruments that require similar skills. Similarly, the timpani, although they are pitched percussion and are tuned by the player, are not included in the tuned percussion subsection owing to the particular skills expected of the player.|$|E

25|$|After the loyalists {{were taken}} away, Minh read the coup {{proclamation}} and his objectives and taped it {{and asked the}} other officers to sign the papers. They then spoke into the recorder, identifying themselves as supporters of the coup. Minh told his subordinates to have copies made of the original, and hid the copies in several places so that his accomplices could not claim {{that they were not}} involved if the putsch failed. Minh was <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> over the radio later that day.|$|E
25|$|When {{the movie}} had its first theater release worldwide, the song {{numbered}} 44 versions, including a special Tahitian-language adaptation created {{specifically for the}} movie. For promotional purposes, South African singer Lira and Filipino singer and actress Janella Salvador recorded their own English-language versions of the song in order <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> over the end credits on the South African and Filipino release of the film, while Indonesian singer Maudy Ayunda and Malaysian singer Ayda Jebat recorded their own versions of the song respectively in Indonesian and Malaysian language.|$|E
25|$|As in most {{aspects of}} life, the pre-war traditions and organisations of Germany were carried {{on by the}} Federal Republic of Germany, which was {{referred}} to as West Germany. This applied also to the restored DFB which had its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main and still employed coach Sepp Herberger. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Neighbouring Switzerland was once again the first team that played West Germany in 1950, with Turkey and Republic of Ireland being the only non-German speaking nations <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> in friendly matches during 1951.|$|E

Some models also have memory cards to expand the memory of the player instead of storing files in the built-in memory.|$|R
25|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Reader's Digest, it was {{reported}} that Carl Haber and Vitaliy Fadeyev were assigned with the task of digitally restoring Dictabelt 10 by Leslie Waffen from the National Archives. Their method consisted of using sensors to map the microscopic contours of the tracks of old sound recordings without having <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> using a stylus, which would further degrade the sound. Dictabelt 10 was worn from countless playings and cracked due to improper storage. By 2010 digital restoration of the Dictabelt seemed a more distant prospect, with both funding and final approval for the project unlikely to be secured in the near future.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 when São Paulo Athletic Club {{celebrated its}} centenary and the English Corinthians Team went across again <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them</b> at Morumbi Stadium. The {{end of the}} tour was against the local {{professional}} Corinthians Paulista team with Sócrates and Rivelino amongst its players. This game was played at Paecambu Stadium in São Paulo and true to Corinthian principles of good clean association football the score was 1 to 0 in favour of the locals when as agreed Socrates changed shirts to play alongside the English amateurs. This {{did not affect the}} score unfortunately although a largely packed stadium was cheering on for a drawn result.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1889, {{prerecorded}} wax cylinders were marketed. These have professionally made {{recordings of}} songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickel-in-the-slot machines—the first juke boxes—installed in arcades and taverns, {{but within a}} few years private owners of phonographs were increasingly buying them for home use. Each cylinder can easily be placed on and removed from the mandrel of the machine used <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>them.</b> Unlike later, shorter-playing high-speed cylinders, early cylinder recordings were usually cut at a speed of about 120 rpm and can play for as long as 3 minutes. They were made of a relatively soft wax formulation and would wear out after they were played a few dozen times. The buyer could then use a mechanism which left their surfaces shaved smooth so new recordings could be made on them.|$|E
50|$|This list {{does not}} include players who were {{allocated}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for GHA in the Scottish Rugby draft whereby players from Scotland's full-time professional squads - Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby - are annually drafted by Scottish Premiership clubs <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for <b>them</b> on weekends when not selected for the professional teams.
