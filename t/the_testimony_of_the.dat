25|$|In the US, a {{small number}} of {{personal}} injury lawsuits have been filed by individuals against cellphone manufacturers (including Motorola, NEC, Siemens, and Nokia) on the basis of allegations of causation of brain cancer and death. In US federal courts, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a Daubert hearing, to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In a 2002 case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff's cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plaintiffs' experts, and denied a motion to exclude <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defendants' experts.|$|E

25|$|Furundžija was a {{commander}} of the Jokers- {{a unit of the}} Bosnian Croatian Militia, which allegedly attacked villages of Bosnian Muslims through imprisonment, murder, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence- he was accused of participating in the torture involving forced sexual intercourse of a woman at the Jokers' headquarters. The prosecution depended on <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman, and this drew debate over the credibility of the victim's memory.

25|$|Following Svatopluk's death, Great Moravia, {{which had}} {{achieved}} its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, {{ceased to be}} a political factor in Central Europe. Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs were the first to withdraw already in 895. Although, at least according to <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between his sons, Mojmír II and Svatopluk II were fostered by Arnulf.

Later, {{his work has}} been translated also into French, English, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Polish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish. Cankar's influence outside the Slovene-speaking area has been small, although his work did influence some non-Slovene authors, such as the French Henri Bordeaux, who also published an essay on Cankar in the 1920s, the Austrian Josef Friedrich Perkonig and the Italian Fulvio Tomizza. According to <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literary critic Josip Vidmar, Cankar's novel Hiša Marije Pomočnice was well received by the famous German writer Thomas Mann, who helped to publish a German edition in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The book {{features}} Hercule Poirot. The {{novel is}} notable as a rigorous attempt to demonstrate Poirot's repeatedly stated contention {{that it is}} possible to solve a mystery purely by reflecting upon <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants, and without access to the scene of the crime. This was the last novel of an especially prolific phase of Christie's work on Poirot. She published thirteen Poirot novels between 1935 and 1942 out of a total of eighteen novels in that period. By contrast, she published only two Poirot novels in the next eight years, indicating the possibility that she was experiencing some frustration with her most popular character. Five Little Pigs is unusual in the way that the same events are retold from several standpoints.|$|E

25|$|Much, but not all, of the {{evidence}} used against the accused, was spectral evidence, or <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> afflicted who claimed to see the apparition or {{the shape of the}} person who was allegedly afflicting them. The theological dispute that ensued about the use of this evidence was based on whether a person had to give permission to the Devil for his/her shape to be used to afflict. Opponents claimed that the Devil was able to use anyone's shape to afflict people, but the Court contended that the Devil could not use a person's shape without that person's permission; therefore, when the afflicted claimed to see the apparition of a specific person, that was accepted as evidence that the accused had been complicit with the Devil.|$|E
25|$|Even if karma is denied, God still {{cannot be}} the {{enforcer}} of consequences. Because {{the motives of}} an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives {{are assumed to be}} egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakriti and cannot be thought to grow in God. <b>The</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.|$|E
