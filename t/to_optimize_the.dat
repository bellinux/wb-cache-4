5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> {{capture of}} solar energy in order <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and {{the mixing of}} plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself).

5|$|Some {{controversy}} has existed over {{the origins of}} captive breeding stock used by The Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies {{were included in the}} breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern anatum (Falco peregrinus anatum), the near extirpation of the anatum in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> genetic diversity found within the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|While Speer had {{tremendous}} power, {{he was of}} course subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct orders from the dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the Gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> use of German and slave labor, Hitler, {{under the influence of}} Martin Bormann, instead appointed Fritz Sauckel. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations– and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the most brutal methods.|$|E

40|$|While many {{efforts have}} been devoted <b>to</b> <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> power output for a finite-time {{thermodynamic}} process, thermodynamic optimization under realistic situations is not necessarily concerned with power alone; rather, it may be of great relevance <b>to</b> <b>optimize</b> generic objective functions that are combinations of power, entropy production, and/or efficiency. One can <b>optimize</b> <b>the</b> objective function for a given model; generally the obtained results are strongly model dependent. However, if the thermodynamic process in question is operated in the linear response regime, then we show in this work {{that it is possible}} to adopt a unified approach <b>to</b> <b>optimizing</b> <b>the</b> objective function, thanks to Onsager’s theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics. A dissipation bound is derived, and based on it, the efficiency associated with the optimization problem, which is universal in the linear response regime and irrespective of model details, can be obtained in a unified way. Our results are in good agreement with previous findings. Moreover, we unveil that the ratio between the stopping time of a finite-time process and <b>the</b> <b>optimized</b> duration time plays a pivotal role in determining the corresponding efficiency in the case of linear response...|$|R
