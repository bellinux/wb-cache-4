500|$|Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan {{gave it a}} mixed review stating, [...] "I'm {{grateful}} that the game was released in English, and while it isn't everything I hoped it would be, Final Fantasy: Dimensions does enough right to be worth playing." [...] Nathan Mustafa of Touchgen however, criticized the dialogue structure, the lack of animation, and sound of the game stating, [...] "In the end, I cannot reconcile these cheapened portions of the game. I understand it is a port of a 'mobile' game from Japan, but {{the quality of the}} port could have been much better. Had my three key issues with how the game presents itself not been present, I would probably have walked away feeling quite positive about Final Fantasy Dimensions. In its current form, <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only give it a middling score." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{officer in}} the attack wrote of the {{importance}} of Wellesley's personal leadership: [...] "The General was {{in the thick of the}} action the whole time... I never saw a man so cool and collected as he was... <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> assure you, 'til our troops got the order to advance the fate of the day seemed doubtful..." [...] With some 6,000 Marathas killed or wounded, the enemy was routed, though Wellesley's force was in no condition to pursue. British casualties were heavy: the British losses were counted as 409 soldiers being killed out of which 164 were Europeans and the remaining 245 were Indian; a further 1,622 British soldiers were wounded and 26 soldiers were reported missing (the British casualty figures were taken from Wellesley's own despatch). Wellesley was troubled by the loss of men and remarked that he hoped [...] "I should not like to see again such loss as I sustained on 23 September, even if attended by such gain". Years later, however, he remarked that Assaye and not Waterloo, was the best battle he ever fought.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sit here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E

"As {{you have}} not starved my curiosity altogether," [...] said Clara, smiling, [...] "but have given it a little hope to feed on for the present, <b>I</b> think, woman <b>though</b> <b>I</b> am, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> promise all you wish. Seriously, Basil," [...] she continued, [...] "that {{telltale}} locket of yours has so pleasantly brightened some very gloomy thoughts of mine about you, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now live happily on expectation, without once mentioning your secret again, till you give me leave to do so." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 23 June 2011 interview, Flea {{discussed}} the band's return {{and how he}} almost quit the Chili Peppers during their hiatus. Flea said, that he just felt {{like he wanted to}} take two years away just to really look and see if the band was [...] "something we should still be doing". [...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. I was proud of what we did." [...] "For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [...] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E
