5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{considered}} attacking Camp Morton, the prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis, to free {{more than}} 5,000 Confederate {{prisoners of war}} imprisoned there, but decided against it. Instead, his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio. With Indiana's militia in pursuit, Morgan's men continued to raid and pillage <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Indiana-Ohio border, crossing into Ohio on July 13. By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become {{a desperate attempt to}} escape to the South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The VI Corps, {{together}} with units from the French IICorps at its flank, pursued {{and tried to}} cut off the German forces on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the town of Dijon, while the Germans planned to prevent another Montélimar with a defensive shield by the 11thPanzer Division. The Allied 45th and 3rdDivisions, as well as the 11thPanzer Division, were racing north to fulfill their objectives. In the meantime, the Germans tried to continue with the evacuation through Lyon. Behind their flight, the Germans destroyed bridges, hoping this would slow down the Allied advance. However, the 45thDivision was able to bypass the German forces, taking the town of Meximieux on 1September. This again posed a threat to the German evacuation. After some initial skirmishes, the 11thPanzer Division launched a heavy attack into the city, causing 215 American casualties and destroying a number of tanks and vehicles.|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} they hunted {{in the forest}} with much joy and with great sport, nor did they turn their faces toward home again until the day was so far spent that the sun had sunk behind {{the tops of the}} tall leafy trees.

After the cinematic dialogue with Steve ends the player is shot out of the black hole, and gets rewarded with the Staff of Life.|$|E
25|$|As the Marines {{approached}} the southern suburbs of the city, {{they began to}} come under increased sniper fire. In one village, the troops dismounted and cleared the houses {{on either side of}} the main street before proceeding. The Marine convoy stopped several times to eliminate resistance in heavy house-to-house and street fighting before proceeding again. At about 15:15 after bloody fighting the Marines managed to make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the MACV Compound. By this time, the enemy attackers had pulled back their forces from the immediate vicinity of the Compound. LtCol Gravel met with Army Col George O. Adkisson, the senior U.S. advisor to the 1st ARVN Division.|$|E

60|$|They made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> leisurely <b>toward</b> {{the rear}} and had almost passed the house, when a deep roar broke the stillness.

25|$|After this, Ramesses II {{called his}} princes {{to meet with}} him and discuss the fault of his {{governors}} and officials in not informing the position of Muwatalli II and his army. As Ramesses was alone with his bodyguard and the Amun division, the vizier was ordered to hasten the arrival of the Ptah and Seth divisions, with the Re division having almost arrived at the camp. While Ramesses was talking with the princes, the Hittite chariots crossed the river and charged the middle of the Re division as they were making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Ramesses' position. The Re division was caught in the open and scattered in all directions. Some fled northward to the Amun camp, all the while being pursued by Hittite chariots.|$|E
25|$|On February 4 and 5, 1862, {{prior to}} the advance against Fort Henry, Union troops {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and a {{flotilla}} of Union ironclads and timberclad gunboats under the command of Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Confederate fort along the Tennessee River in western Tennessee. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. Charles F. Smith's division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.|$|E
500|$|The {{scattered}} {{remnants of}} the American rear laboriously made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Rutland in order to rejoin the main army. [...] Harassed by Fraser's scouts and Indians, and without food or shelter, it took some of them five days to reach the army, which was by then nearing Fort Edward. [...] Others, including Colonel Hale and a detachment of 70 men, were captured by the British as they mopped up the scene.|$|E

60|$|Then King Arthur and Sir Ewain and Sir Ector de Maris and {{the young}} Sir Launcelot laid <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>toward</b> Camelot. And, as they journeyed so together, Sir Ewain communicated privily to Sir Ector de Maris how that the youth had a mark as of a golden star upon {{the skin of his}} {{shoulder}}, and upon this news Sir Ector fell very silent. For Sir Ector knew that that sign was upon his own brother's shoulder, and {{he did not know how}} it could be upon the shoulder of any other man. Wherefore, he wist not what to think that it should be upon the shoulder of this youth. But he said naught of these thoughts to Sir Ewain, but held his peace.|$|R

500|$|The 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{began to}} {{parachute}} and glide onto their objectives at 07:00, with most parachutists and glider pilots able to land relatively {{close to their}} targets despite the smoke and dust from the bombing. Some gliders landed significantly off course, including one that landed {{in front of the}} Bastasi cave [...] to the west of Drvar, and several that landed in a locality named Vrtoče near Drvar (not to be confused with Vrtoče between Bihać and Petrovac, which was on the axis of advance of the 92nd Motorised Regiment). The occupants of the glider that landed in Bastasi were immediately killed by members of the Tito Escort Battalion guarding the cave, and the occupants of the gliders at Vrtoče had to fight <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Drvar. After landing, the first wave of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion quickly gained control of Drvar.|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of Spin {{gave the}} album six stars out of ten, saying it [...] "contains plenty of aggressively arty material" [...] and calling [...] "The Messenger" [...] the [...] "most {{unexpected}} track on the boldly conceived A Thousand Suns". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating and said [...] "at times the band's odd mélange of industrial grind, hip-hop swagger, and teenage-wasteland angst feels jarring". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave it three stars out of five; he said Linkin Park were [...] "feeling <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> a new identity"; he called their skill for melody [...] "obvious" [...] {{and said they}} sounded like [...] "a killer Linkin Park tribute band". Australia's Music Network magazine gave the album a mixed review, calling it [...] "a radical shift for the band, but it’s also a very uneven one...while there's some commanding moments ('The Catalyst,' 'Wretches and Kings'), many of the tracks feel like experiments rather than formed songs".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a P-61 Black Widow {{from the}} 547th Night Fighter Squadron, named Hard to Get, {{had taken off}} at 18:00, piloted by Capt. Kenneth Schrieber and 1st Lt. Bonnie Rucks. About 45minutes before the attack, Schrieber cut the power to the left engine at [...] over the camp. He {{restarted}} it, creating a loud backfire, and repeated the procedure twice more, losing altitude to [...] Pretending that his plane was crippled, Schneber headed toward low hills, clearing them by a mere [...] To the Japanese observers, it seemed the plane had crashed and they watched, waiting for a fiery explosion. Schneber repeated this several times while also performing various aerobatic maneuvers. The ruse continued for twenty minutes, creating a diversion for the Rangers inching <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the camp on their bellies. Prince later commended the pilots' actions: [...] "The idea of an aerial decoy was a little unusual and honestly, I didn't think it would work, not in a million years. But the pilot's maneuvers were so skillful and deceptive that the diversion was complete. I don't know where {{we would have been}} without it." [...] As the plane buzzed the camp, Lt. Carlos Tombo and his guerrillas along with a small number of Rangers cut the camp's telephone lines to prevent communication with the large force stationed in Cabanatuan.|$|E
5000|$|The next day, December 23, {{it began}} snowing as the Patriot forces made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back <b>toward</b> the coast. The march {{home of the}} Patriot force was {{difficult}} because the force was unprepared for the weather. Richardson's army was dissolved, {{and most of the}} Patriots returned home. [...] Richardson took 136 prisoners, who were dispatched to Charleston under guard on January 2, 1776.|$|R
60|$|The tusker {{turned and}} moved slowly off along a broad, tree-arched trail, pausing {{occasionally}} to pluck a tender branch, or strip the edible bark from an adjacent tree. Tarzan sprawled face downward upon the beast's head and back, his legs hanging on either side, his head supported by his open palms, his elbows {{resting on the}} broad cranium. And thus they made <b>their</b> leisurely <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the gathering place of the tribe.|$|R
60|$|Leaving {{the captain}} a prisoner, Dan Baxter and Lew Flapp made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> with caution <b>toward</b> the houseboat. As they had surmised, the Dora was now totally deserted. They leaped {{on the deck}} and entered the sumptuous living room.|$|R
500|$|... "Secrets" [...] {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} political commentators for its [...] "potentially misleading perception" [...] of emergency contraception. Shawn Rhea of Planned Parenthood cited that the morning-after pills do not induce abortion, as the episode implies. Erin Gloria Ryan of Jezebel wrote: [...] "Lori {{would have been}} better off sending the men off to loot a shop that sells herbal remedies and brewing herself some pennyroyal tea or climbing a tree and jumping out in hopes that the impact would end the pregnancy. Both of those things are dangerous and might not work, but they're about as effective as OD'ing on levonorgestrel." [...] Ryan prescribed that actual abortion pills are administered by medical professionals and are not available at pharmacies. Danielle Aronson of ACLU summated that the effectiveness of terminating a pregnancy with emergency contraception would be equivalent to [...] "cutting a zombie's finger off to kill it." [...] Similarly, Slate Amanda Marcotte opined: [...] "The problem with this storyline, outside the tedious fear of getting letters from irate anti-choicers that dictates TV's near-absolute approach to unintended pregnancy, is simple: Morning-after pills are not abortion." [...] Marcotte asserted that abortion pills, commonly RU-486, were only provided by medical personnel. [...] "Morning-after pills are contraception, and they work by stifling ovulation before any sperm can make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Fallopian tubes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus organized, {{at the end}} of April, the {{regiment}} marched up the Rappahannock River around Gen. Robert E. Lee's left flank, on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Battle of Chancellorsville. On the Morning of May 3 (after General Jackson's wounding), the resumption of the famous 'Flank Attack' bore heavily upon the 1st Division. [...] Generally, the XII Corps played a significant role throughout the battle in defending their part of Hooker's line and covering the army's retreat afterward.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Cracker Line" [...] {{having been}} opened, General Hazen joyfully exclaimed [...] "We've knocked {{the lid off}} the cracker box!" [...] By mid {{afternoon}} on October 27 the pontoon bridge across the river was completed by the 1st Michigan Engineers. Hooker's Federal reinforcements were on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Brown's Ferry. Fearing that this attack was merely a diversion while the real Union attack would come from the south, Longstreet failed to counterattack immediately. Under pressure from Bragg, Longstreet would launch an attack two days later in the Battle of Wauhatchie, but this attack failed.|$|E
50|$|I-94 leaves Milwaukee to the south, joining with I-41 at the Mitchell Interchange. These two Interstates run {{concurrently}} to the border, passing west of Racine and Kenosha on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into Illinois <b>toward</b> Chicago. Traffic {{is heavy}} along this stretch.|$|R
60|$|A {{half mile}} from the valley in which Tarzan stood, a score of white-robed figures, bearing long, wicked-looking guns, halted at the sound, and {{looked at one another}} with {{questioning}} eyes.

60|$|So {{they went}} and tried three other inns in turn. At {{two of them}} they met with a like greeting, but {{the doors of the}} third were closed and the place was deserted.

Thus they wended <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back <b>toward</b> the great central rock, {{thinking}} that there they might find some more hospitable tavern.|$|R
2500|$|Facial {{expression}} {{discrimination and}} expression develop at varying rates in children. [...] During middle childhood and adolescence, the abilities to discriminate and produce facial expressions {{are still on}} <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> achieving full potential. [...] Considering {{that the ability to}} discriminate and produce facial expressions develop independently, there is a gap between a child's capacity to discriminate an emotion on another's face and their capacity to produce certain emotions, such as anger or fear. [...] Fear and anger are more difficult expressions to produce than happiness, a possible explanation being that children are socialized not to produce these, considered socially undesirable. [...] Further research is required to fully explore this idea.|$|E
2500|$|Take That's first TV {{appearance}} was on The Hit Man and Her in 1990, where they performed Barlow's self-written, unreleased song, [...] "My Kind of Girl". They later appeared {{a second time}} to perform [...] "Waiting Around", which would become the B-side for the first single, [...] "Do What U Like". [...] "Promises" [...] and [...] "Once You've Tasted Love" [...] were also released as singles but were minor hits in the UK. Take That initially worked the same territory as their American counterparts, singing new jack R, urban soul, and mainstream pop. However they worked <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Hi-NRG dance music, while also pursuing an adult contemporary ballad direction. As they aimed {{to break into the}} mainstream music industry, they worked a manner of small clubs, schools and events across the country building up a fanbase as they travelled to gigs constantly for months.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the stampeding of prisoners, strong senior {{officers}} such as Colonel Harrison C. Hobart {{had the sense}} of mind to tie off the flow of escapees before dawn’s light. [...] "The remaining prisoners replaced the bricks at the fireplace, and the guards began their morning routine, unaware that 109 escaped Union officers were making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Federal lines." [...] Keeping the escape secret from the Confederate guards until the last possible moment gave the evading inmates what they needed most: time. [...] After the morning roll call came up over a hundred short, the Confederates counted frantically several more times {{to ensure that the}} Yankees weren’t pulling a trick. [...] Such [...] "tricks" [...] had occurred on many occasions when men slipped {{in and out of the}} counting lines; this [...] "repeating" [...] was a mild prank often used to frustrate the Confederates at roll call, much to the glee of the Union prisoners.|$|E
