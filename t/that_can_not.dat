5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed.

5|$|Cẩn's {{diabetes}} worsened {{during the}} course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge <b>that</b> <b>Cẩn</b> <b>not</b> be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E

5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E

25|$|The {{structures}} {{defined by}} these axioms {{are more general}} than those obtained from the vector space construction given above. If the (projective) dimension is at least three then, by the Veblen–Young theorem, there is no difference. However, for dimension two, there are examples that satisfy these axioms <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be constructed from vector spaces (or even modules over division rings). These examples do not satisfy the Theorem of Desargues and are known as Non-Desarguesian planes. In dimension one, any set with at least three elements satisfies the axioms, so it is usual to assume additional structure for projective lines defined axiomatically.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem of oxidation is to replace the hydrogens ortho to the carbon-carbon double bond by groups <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be removed during the oxidation. Following the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, the photochemical 6π cyclization takes place in a conrotatory fashion, leading to products with an anti configuration of the methyl substitutents. As both methyl groups are attached to a stereogenic center, two enantiomers (R,R and S,S) are formed, normally as a racemic mixture. This approach also has the advantage that the thermal (disrotatory) ring closure can not take place because of steric hindrance between the substitution groups.|$|E

25|$|Non-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Experts {{believed}} that the measurement of protection factors in the laboratory allows them to correctly evaluate, predict the RPD efficiency in the workplace conditions. But after the detection of cases of excessive harmful exposure on employees who used high quality respirators with HEPA particle filters in the nuclear industry of the USA, the experts changed their opinion. Studies {{have been carried out}} to measure the protection factors for the various types of respirators - not only in the laboratories, but also at the workplaces. Dozens of such field {{studies have shown that the}} performance of serviceable respiratory protective equipment at the workplaces may be significantly less than in laboratory conditions. Therefore, the usage of laboratory results to assess the real efficiency is incorrect; and can lead to a wrong choice of such respirators <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> reliably protect workers.|$|E
