When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used again.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{this growth}} {{in both the}} size and role of the church, {{progress}} was intermittently undermined by internal conflict over churchmanship. This was manifested {{in the creation of}} competing theological schools (Trinity versus Wycliffe Colleges in the University of Toronto, for example), a refusal by bishops of one ecclesiastical party to ordain those of the other, and – in the most extreme cases – schism. This latter phenomenon was famously and acrimoniously borne out in the high profile defection of Edward Cridge, the Dean of the Diocese of British Columbia in Victoria, B.C., together with much of his cathedral congregation, to the Reformed Episcopal Church in 1874, although the movement was ultimately confined <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> congregation in a then-remote town together with a second parish in New Westminster, the then-capital of the originally separate mainland colony of British Columbia.|$|E

500|$|It {{is rated}} PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "intense {{sequences}} of sci-fi violence, action, and language," [...] unlike {{the first three}} films which are rated R. The decision to release the film with a PG-13 rating has met with much criticism from fans, {{as well as the}} media. The rating decision was made after McG cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as the director felt disallowing the young audience due <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> shot was unfair. He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because [...] "It was a soft moment {{between a man and a}} woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in Witness [...] in the end, it felt more like a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters." [...] The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as the 2007 action film, Live Free or Die Hard.|$|E

2500|$|Small Heath {{suffered}} a predictable defeat at Hyde Road against Manchester City on New Year's Day.

After the interval, City increased their lead first from a scrimmage, and again from a free kick. After the recent defeats, the committee made several changes for the following day's visit to Gainsborough Trinity. Jimmy Inglis, reported to have been [...] "content to take matters too easily of late", was omitted, Billy Walton moved from the half-back line to his former position of inside right, and Tom Farnall returned at half-back. Gainsborough fielded former Small Heath players Bernard Pumfrey and Tom Bayley. Although the visitors fell behind early in the game, goals from Walton and Denny Hodgetts gave the visitors a half-time lead, which was extended to 3–1 by the close.|$|E

40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle?

Of course, if <b>one</b> does know <b>that</b> P, <b>one’s</b> epistemic position with respect <b>to</b> the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> <b>one</b> positively knows <b>that</b> <b>one</b> does not know that P, as opposed to merely failing <b>to</b> know <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

2500|$|Initially acts {{performing}} {{on the show}} mimed to the commercially released record, but in 1966 after discussions with the Musicians' Union, miming was banned. After a few weeks during which some bands' attempts to play {{as well as on}} their records were somewhat lacking, a compromise was reached whereby a specially recorded backing track was permitted – as long as all the musicians on the track were present in the studio. The TOTP Orchestra, led by Johnny Pearson, augmented the tracks when necessary. This set-up continued until 1980, when a protracted Musicians' Union strike resulted in the dropping of the live orchestra altogether and the use of pre-recorded tracks only. This accounts for a number of acts who never appeared on the show due to their reluctance to perform in this way. Highlights have included Jimi Hendrix who, on hearing someone else's track being played by mistake (in the days of live broadcast), mumbled [...] "I don't know the words <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>one,</b> man", Shane MacGowan of The Pogues' drunken performance of [...] "Fairytale of New York", a performance of [...] "Roll with It" [...] by Oasis in which Noel and Liam Gallagher exchanged roles with Noel miming to Liam's singing track and Liam pretending to play guitar, and John Peel's appearance as the mandolin soloist for Rod Stewart on [...] "Maggie May".|$|E
