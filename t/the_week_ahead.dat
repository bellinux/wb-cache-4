30|$|Besides {{taking on}} {{leadership}} roles {{where they are}} designing and facilitating these experiences, Bali and Caines use these heutagogical and transformational learning approaches in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ahead</b> in their own learning. Bali is giving a workshop locally about critical pedagogy soon. She has very few people in her face to face surroundings who understand critical pedagogy enough to give a workshop on it, so she blogs her thoughts and asks some people to give her feedback by posting the link on Twitter and adding hashtags to some recent MOOCs she had participated in, as well as posting it in the VConnecting buddies Slack #random channel. Several people comment on ways of improving the activities and someone suggests a change of order. Most of the suggestions make sense. One {{does not apply to}} her context, so she ignores it. At the same time, Caines is excited that her institution is implementing a Domain of One’s Own (DoOO) initiative. Besides having managed many of her own domains for several years and having helped to collaboratively maintain domains and sites for several of her projects, Caines is attracted to the philosophy behind DoOO with its focus on ownership and agency. Still, Caines knows that Domain of One’s Own, especially as it is deployed institutionally, is a complex idea that often becomes problematic without critical dialog. Because the project is so new she is having trouble putting her ideas into a blog post, however, in <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ahead</b> she calls on various members of her PLN to ask specific questions about technical deployment and larger philosophical concepts.|$|R
