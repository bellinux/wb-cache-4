5|$|In {{addition}} to working dress, {{the army has}} a number of parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions such as at <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guard at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed. <b>The</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect {{of the change in}} temperature, i.e. a physiological response not a simple physical effect.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{the site}} hosted eleven {{different}} residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, {{although they have}} been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of the rooms {{are open to the}} public, as state functions are still carried out within. <b>The</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} {{were aware that}} the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb at <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain {{in preparation for the}} attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary and}} most visible {{function}} of the Ceremonial Guard is, as mentioned, <b>the</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guard on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, the national capital of Canada. <b>The</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guard Ceremony is a parade representing <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guards/sentries posted at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Canadian monarch when in Ottawa, and her representative, the Governor General, in her absence. A full company of two platoons is employed in daily public duties, with both divisions of one platoon parading as the 'new guard' – those to take over duties at Rideau Hall – and the other platoon of the company split, one division parading as 'old guard', and the other performing sentry duties at Rideau Hall and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for the day.|$|E
