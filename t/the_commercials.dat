5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical personal stories or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E
5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. <b>The</b> <b>commercials</b> also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing <b>the</b> <b>commercials,</b> that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E

SUMMARY In this diploma thesis I {{have focused}} on the topic of <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register and other topics related to <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register. <b>The</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register is {{possible}} to describe as a public register in which certain data about certain persons is recorded in the accordance with the Czech law. <b>The</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register is regulated mainly in <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Code and in the Civil Procedure Code. The main function of <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> register is to provide some basic facts about every person (entrepreneur) recorded into <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register. Another important function is to protect every third person acting in good faith regarding the facts entered in <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register. Every person can inspect the register and ask for a printout for every recorded person. This principle written above is so-called principle of formal publicity of <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register. All <b>the</b> records in <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register are legally effective on everyone from the day of their performance by the Register Court (so-called positive aspect of the principle of material publicity). In the case a third person acts in confidence of the entry in <b>the</b> <b>Commercial</b> Register, a recorded person can not rely {{on the fact that the}} entry does not corresponds with the real fact [...] ...|$|R
