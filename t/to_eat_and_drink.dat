25|$|Muslims {{follow the}} Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are Halal and {{permissible}} to consume. Halal foods are food items that Muslims are allowed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> under Islamic dietary guidelines. The criteria specify both what foods are allowed, {{and how the}} food must be prepared. The foods addressed are mostly types of meat, which are allowed in Islam.|$|E
25|$|These {{restrictions}} are waived {{in the case}} of health issues but a competent Posek, a rabbi who decides Jewish Law, must be consulted. For example, those who are seriously ill will be allowed <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b> On other fast days almost any medical condition may justify breaking the fast; in practice, since many cases differ, consultation with a rabbi is often necessary. Ritual washing up to the knuckles is permitted. Washing to cleanse dirt or mud from one's body is also permitted.|$|E
25|$|Jezebel, enraged that Elijah {{had ordered}} the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah. Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, {{continues}} alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him {{to wake up and}} eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> because he has a long journey ahead of him.|$|E

The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b> Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, O'Connell {{published}} Lyrics, a book {{of poetry}} evincing a [...] "Celtic strain." [...] The poetry displays O'Connell's sense of sunt lacrimae rerum, {{that there will be}} tears with trials, and it expresses his bittersweet joy in life's evanescent pleasures. O'Connell wrote an Irish-themed play, The Red Fox, which was staged with moderate success in San Francisco about 1882. O'Connell wrote [...] "Ghoul's Quest" [...] for The Argonaut. In 1891, he published The Inner Man: Good Things <b>to</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drink</b> and Where to Get Them, a collection of anecdotes and advice for the epicurean who finds himself in the San Francisco area, and a cautionary description of common 19th century food adulterants such as chemical dyes and powdered lead.|$|E
500|$|The final track, [...] "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast", {{is divided}} into three segments, each with its own {{descriptive}} title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at Abbey Road. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|Leaving Tenerife, Girl Pat {{continued}} her journey southward, following the African coast. According to Stone's account, the crew went ashore at Port Etienne in French West Africa (now Nouadhibou, in Mauritania), leaving the boat unguarded. While they were away, marauders stole gear and provisions, leaving the crew almost destitute: [...] "All {{we had left}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> were four bottles of water, a tin of corned beef, a bottle of lime juice and a tin of condensed milk". Leaving Port Etienne, they ran aground on a sandbank and were stranded for three days.

500|$|The {{extent of}} the {{theological}} division among the reformers became evident when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V asked them to present their views to him in 1530 at the Diet of Augsburg. Philipp Melanchthon, the [...] main delegate from Wittenberg, quickly prepared the draft that eventually became the Augsburg Confession. [...] The Wittenberg theologians rejected attempts by Strasbourg to adopt it without the article on the Lord's Supper. In response, Bucer wrote a new confession, the Confessio Tetrapolitana (Tetrapolitan Confession), so named because only four cities adopted it, Strasbourg and three other southern German cities, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau. A copy of Melanchthon's draft {{was used as the}} starting point and the only major change was the wording on the article on the eucharist. [...] According to Eells, the article on the eucharist in the Tetrapolitan Confession stated, [...] "In this sacrament his true body and true blood are truly given <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink,</b> as food for their souls, and to eternal life, that they may remain in him and he in them". The ambiguous word [...] "truly" [...] was not defined.|$|E
500|$|According {{to another}} prisoner's account, Allen wandered off after {{learning}} of his son's death. He {{was arrested for}} violating his parole, and placed in solitary confinement. There he remained while Vermont declared independence, and John Burgoyne's campaign for the Hudson River met a stumbling block near Bennington in August 1777. On May 3, 1778 he was transferred to Staten Island. He was admitted to General John Campbell's quarters, where he was invited <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> with the general and several other British field officers. Allen stayed there for two days and was treated politely. On the third day Allen was exchanged for Colonel Archibald Campbell, who was conducted to the exchange by Colonel Elias Boudinot, the American commissary general of prisoners appointed by General George Washington. Following the exchange, Allen reported to Washington at Valley Forge. On May 14, he was breveted a colonel in the Continental Army in [...] "reward of his fortitude, firmness and zeal {{in the cause of}} his country, manifested during his long and cruel captivity, as well as on former occasions," [...] and given military pay of $75 per month. The brevet rank, however, meant that there was no active role, until called, for Allen. Allen's services were never requested, and eventually the payments stopped.|$|E

2500|$|The tales told by royalist {{writers of}} the cruelty inflicted by Simon and his wife on the child are not proven.

2500|$|Located in North Staffordshire, Keele's {{campus is}} rural with many 19th-century {{architectural}} {{features such as}} Keele Hall predating the concrete and red-brick buildings of the modern university.

6000|$|The dinner, {{considering}} {{the house in}} which it was spread, was quite recherché. George said to himself that the fat fowls which he saw must have come from Harcourt's larder. Roast mutton and boiled beef--not together, but one on one day and the other on the next--generally constituted the fare at Mr. Bertram's house when he did not sit down to dinner alone. But now there was quite a little banquet.

2500|$|Ceaseless {{explosions and}} {{concussion}} from shell bursts at {{the mouths of}} caverns caused rock falls and spread thick clouds of dust. The garrisons changed position but rarely found a spot not under bombardment. A feeling of impotence spread among the defenders and was made worse when the German artillery was silenced. French artillery barrages on the roads from Laon across the Ailette to the Chemin-des-Dames, {{made it impossible for}} ammunition to be carried forward. Even long-range [...] naval guns near Pinon, were later found to be without ammunition. Morale among the German infantry of the cave garrisons was also depressed by isolation and the unprecedented gas shell bombardment, which forced them permanently to wear masks. Supply routes were closed by curtains of shrapnel fire and from [...] the Ailette valley and the sides and summits of the spurs projecting into it from the ridge were blanketed by gas, which made it impossible for German gunners to remove their gas masks <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Eating or {{drinking}} during labour {{is an area}} of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) {{in the event of an}} emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. A 2013 Cochrane review found that with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no change in harms from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. They additionally acknowledge that not eating does not mean there is an empty stomach or that its contents are not as acidic. They therefore conclude that [...] "women should be free <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink</b> in labour, or not, as they wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{school of}} Rabbi Yannai {{interpreted}} the place name Di-zahab (...) in [...] {{to refer to}} one of the Israelites' sins that Moses recounted in the opening of his address. The school of Rabbi Yannai deduced from the word Di-zahab that Moses spoke insolently towards heaven. The school of Rabbi Yannai taught that Moses told God that {{it was because of the}} silver and gold ( [...] , zahav) that God showered on the Israelites until they said [...] "Enough" [...] ( [...] , dai) that the Israelites made the Golden Calf. They said in the school of Rabbi Yannai that a lion does not roar with excitement over a basket of straw but over a basket of meat. Rabbi Oshaia likened it to the case of a man who had a lean but large-limbed cow. The man gave the cow good feed to eat and the cow started kicking him. The man deduced that it was feeding the cow good feed that caused the cow to kick him. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba likened it to the case of a man who had a son and bathed him, anointed him, gave him plenty <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> <b>drink,</b> hung a purse round his neck, and set him down at the door of a brothel. How could the boy help sinning? Rav Aha the son of Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Sheshet that this bears out the popular saying that a full stomach leads to a bad impulse.
