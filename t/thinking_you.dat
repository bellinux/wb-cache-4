On 7 October 1999–140 days after the accident—she {{returned to}} the hospital in Tromsø and met the doctors and nurses that helped save her life. Bågenholm commented: [...] "When you are a patient, you're not <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> are going to die. You think, I'm going to make it. But as a medical person, I think it's amazing that I'm alive." [...] As of October 2009, Bågenholm has made an almost full recovery, although minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury remain. In late 2009, she was working as a radiologist at the hospital where her life was saved.|$|E
500|$|Ladytron's mix of [...] "Like Eating Glass" [...] {{replaces the}} lead and rhythm guitars with looped {{synthesisers}} and adds {{a large amount of}} reverberation to the vocals; the resulting effect was described by Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe as [...] "walking out of your apartment and <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> can hear Bloc Party playing a festival six blocks over". Whitey reworked [...] "Helicopter" [...] in a minimalist fashion and introduced wolf howls and a xylophone staccato to the song. The musician's effects gave the track a rawer sound than the original version according to Heather Phares of Allmusic. [...] "Positive Tension" [...] was remixed by Jason Clark of art punk band Pretty Girls Make Graves under the pseudonym [...] "Blackbox". The song includes elements of oldschool jungle. The Paul Epworth edit of single [...] "Banquet", under his [...] "Phones" [...] moniker, is more sparse than the original and is closer to dance music than indie rock.|$|E
500|$|Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' {{acting and}} the episode as a whole, deeming it [...] "the best thing on {{television}} all week". He opined that Davies: [...] "plays Creek to easy perfection: mumbling, lugubrious, quietly brilliant", {{and called the}} plot [...] "involving, intriguing, [...] original", stating that it [...] "did the thing all good thrillers, books or films, do of getting you actively, cleverly involved in <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> can see the answer before anyone else. You couldn't." [...] The List's Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode, calling it [...] "surprisingly splendid festive fare", in which [...] "The twists and resolutions were, to this watcher at least, as well hidden as Davies’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce." [...] The Times Tim Teeman deemed the episode [...] "comfort television", commenting on its [...] "rambling pace" [...] and writing that: [...] "Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward, funny and idiosyncratic (as you'd expect from the creator, writer and director David Renwick)." [...] The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan agreed that the episode felt [...] "comfy and familiar", but also found its run-time overstretched, writing that it: ...|$|E

500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, [...] "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> can do this..." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was <b>thinking.</b> <b>You</b> know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh.

In her autobiography, Consuelo Vanderbilt described how she was required to wear a steel rod, which ran down her spine and fastened around her waist and over her shoulders, to improve her posture. She was educated entirely at home by governesses and tutors and learned foreign languages at an early age. Her mother was a strict disciplinarian and whipped her with a riding crop for minor infractions. When, as a teenager, Consuelo objected to the clothing her mother had selected for her, Alva told her that [...] "I do the <b>thinking,</b> <b>you</b> do as you are told." ...|$|E
2500|$|Feeling the {{pressures}} of success, {{with much of the}} burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on Vedder, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. Vedder's issue with fame came from what he stated as [...] "what happens when {{a lot of these people}} start <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> can change their lives or save their lives or whatever and create these impossible fuckin' expectations that in the end just start tearing you apart." [...] In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band's ability to tour in the United States. During the mid-1990s, Vedder faced what he called a [...] "pretty intense stalker problem".Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from No Code.|$|E

2500|$|Loeb confessed first. He {{asserted}} that Leopold had planned everything, and had killed Franks {{in the back}} seat of the car while he, Loeb, drove. Leopold's confession followed swiftly thereafter; but he insisted that he was the driver, and Loeb the murderer. [...] Their confessions otherwise corroborated most of the evidence in the case. Leopold later claimed, in his book (long after Loeb was dead), that he pleaded in vain with Loeb to admit to killing Franks. [...] "Mompsie feels less terrible than she might, <b>thinking</b> <b>you</b> did it," [...] he quotes Loeb as saying, [...] "and I'm not going to take that shred of comfort away from her." [...] While most observers believed that Loeb did indeed strike the fatal blows, [...] some circumstantial evidence—including testimony from eyewitness Carl Ulvigh, who said he saw Loeb driving and Leopold {{in the back seat}} minutes before the kidnapping—suggested that Leopold could have been the killer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1981, Strait {{released}} his first single for MCA Records, entitled [...] "Unwound", which climbed to #6 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart that year, and was included on his debut album Strait Country. The record featured two more singles including [...] "Down and Out", a No.16 hit for Strait, and [...] "If You're <b>Thinking</b> <b>You</b> Want a Stranger (There's One Coming Home)", which reached number three early in 1982, sparking a string of Top Ten hits that ran well into the 1990s. Strait Country was hailed by critics as a traditionalist breakthrough that broke the trend of pop-influenced country prevalent at the time. The year 1982 also saw the release of Strait's second album, the critically acclaimed Strait from the Heart, which featured the first number one single of his career, [...] "Fool Hearted Memory", and the top five [...] "Amarillo by Morning", regarded by many {{as one of the}} greatest country songs of all-time. In 1983, Strait made his first appearance at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo when the headlining star, Eddie Rabbitt, came down sick with the flu. Performing at that rodeo has since become a mainstay throughout his career, making more than twenty appearances at the Rodeo, and playing to a total of more than one million fans.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... thinking about something. I always wanted to know what he was <b>thinking,</b> <b>you</b> know? Who knows what he was thinking in his head? ... We got used to what the whole environment was. It was very musical; there was always a piano going.
