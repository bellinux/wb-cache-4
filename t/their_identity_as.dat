25|$|By the 1820s, the fur trade had {{expanded}} into the Rocky Mountains where American and British interests begin {{to compete for}} control of the lucrative trade. The Métis would {{play a key role in}} this competition. The early Métis congregated around trading posts where they were employed as packers, laborers, or boatmen. Through their efforts they helped to create a new order centered on the trading posts. Other Métis traveled with the trapping brigades in a loose business arrangement where authority was taken lightly and independence was encouraged. By the 1830s Canadians and Americans were venturing into the West to secure a new fur supply. Companies like the NWC and the HBC provided employment opportunities for Métis. By the end of the 19th century, many companies considered the Métis to be Indian in <b>their</b> <b>identity.</b> <b>As</b> a result, many Métis left the companies in order to pursue freelance work.|$|E

25|$|These color divides {{reinforced}} racial {{barriers between}} African and Brazilian slaves, and often created animosity between them. These differences were heightened after freedom was granted, for lighter skin correlated with social mobility {{and the greater}} chance an ex-slave could distance him- or herself from their former slave life. Thus, mulattoes and lighter-skinned ex-slaves had larger opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status {{within the confines of}} the colonial Brazilian social structure. As a consequence, self-segregation was common, as mulattoes preferred to separate <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> much as possible from blacks. One way this is visible is from data on church marriages during the 19th century. Church marriage was an expensive affair, and one only the more successful ex-slaves were able to afford, and these marriages were also almost always endogamous. The fact that skin color largely dictated possible partners in marriage promoted racial distinctions as well. Interracial marriage was a rarity, and was almost always a case of a union between a white man and a mulatto woman.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in time Jewish {{immigration}} to Mandatory Palestine continued, while to some opinions a similar, but less documented, immigration also took place in the Arab sector, bringing workers from Syria and other neighbouring areas. Palestinian Arabs saw this rapid influx of Jewish immigrants as a threat to their homeland and <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> a people. Moreover, Jewish policies of purchasing land and prohibiting the employment of Arabs in Jewish-owned industries and farms greatly angered the Palestinian Arab communities. Demonstrations were held as early as 1920, protesting what the Arabs felt were unfair preferences for the Jewish immigrants set forth by the British mandate that governed Palestine at the time. This resentment led to outbreaks of violence later that year, as the al-Husseini incited riots broke out in Jerusalem. Winston Churchill's 1922 White Paper tried to reassure the Arab population, denying that the creation of a Jewish state was the intention of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E
25|$|While {{traveling}} through Styria, Behmen and Felson encounter the grotesque sight of people {{infected with the}} Black Death and discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise, who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl is truly a witch, and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who {{wants to become a}} knight like his deceased father; a knight, Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from Marburg, shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen.|$|E
40|$|Since the Alien Registration Law was promulgated and {{enforced}} in 1990, {{the number of}} Brazilian nationals who came to Japan has increased. Now some of them started going back to Brazil and coming back to Japan. This means {{that the number of}} "Brazilian returnee students" will increase. This paper has the following three objects. First is to explain how these two countries are different in the sense of maturity of multiculturalism and to refer to how it affects transformation of returnees'identities. Four classifications are established. "Japanese", "Brazilian", "Bi-cultural", and "Marginalized. Second is to analyze how they can transform <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> in Brazil after going back from Japan according to time and to extract the factors to promote and obstruct for them to obtain <b>their</b> <b>identities.</b> Third is to extract the factors that can make it possible for them {{to bridge the gap between}} two cultures. The definition of identities in this paper is to set oneself in the society. Specifically participant's observation and interviews were carried out for four returnees in local school near Sao Paulo city for three months. From the interpretation and analysis, it can be said that returnees can obtain <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> <b>as</b> Japanese easier, if they visit Japan in early childhood, and the classrooms in Japanese school have atmosphere to accept cross culture, and returnee families had Japanese culture in Brazil. But the fact that Japan is less matured in multiculturalism and its rigid educational system can obstruct returnees from obtaining <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> <b>as</b> Japanese. On the other hand. Brazils maturity in multiculturalism and its flexible educational system can promote returnees to obtain <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> <b>as</b> Brazilians. But the capacity of Brazilian society and the parents as role model may obstrLict them from doing it. Finally returnees can obtain <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> <b>as</b> a bi-cultural person if they can consent where to live and if they can use their bi-cultural resources in their families...|$|R

In 2006, FPÖ members of parliament reaffirmed the party's root in the pan-Germanist tradition, at least symbolically, by wearing blue cornflowers in their buttonholes, along with ribbons in Austria's national colours (red and white), during the initial meeting of the National Council. This caused controversy, as the media interpreted the flower as a former Nazi symbol.|$|E

Whilst taking account of how social expectations about 'twins', 'childhood' and 'adulthood' impact on twins' lives, this book explores the active role that twins themselves take in shaping <b>their</b> own <b>identities.</b> It shows how, by utilizing their bodies, physical space and talk, twins variously play up and play down <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> <b>as</b> twins. As well as being of interest to those who want to know more about twins, this book will appeal to students interested in the social study of childhood, siblingship and identity...|$|R

When I started graduate school in the Department of Musicology at UCLA, I gravitated toward studying issues related to performance, topics such as virtuosity and performance practice.
