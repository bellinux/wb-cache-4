From this forest sanctuary, panoramic views of the city of Portland, the Willamette and Columbia rivers, and five major peaks of the Cascade Range ... can be seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> fir trees.

500|$|Not {{long after}} the Mexican {{reinforcements}} arrived, Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince's Bridge, [...] away, to slow down any further Mexican reinforcements. [...] At [...] the Texians began creeping quietly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass, pulling the cannon behind them. [...] The Texian cannon fired at 4:30, beginning the battle of San Jacinto. [...] After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand-to-hand combat. [...] Mexican soldiers were taken completely by surprise. [...] Santa Anna, [...] Castrillón, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense. [...] Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives. [...] The killing lasted for hours.|$|E

2500|$|The {{divide between}} the Atlantic and Gulf watersheds, {{part of a larger}} divide known as the Eastern Continental Divide, lies not along the Smoky Mountains, <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> in <b>the</b> state, but rather along the lower Blue Ridge Mountains to the east. [...] The western slopes of the Blue Ridge form the {{headwaters}} of the French Broad and the Kanawha Rivers. [...] <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>taller</b> Smoky Mountains, these rivers pass through deep canyons known as water gaps. [...] For example the Hiwassee River and its tributaries follow a series of canyons between Cleveland, Tennessee and Murphy, North Carolina, part of which can be followed driving along the Ocoee Scenic Byway.|$|R

60|$|Soon {{they reached}} the Mexican shore, {{at a point where}} there was a wide stretch of {{marshland}} with not a building in sight. They had gotten several glimpses of Ward Porton making his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass. The trail was an easy one to follow.|$|E
60|$|We were {{following}} the cows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass and bushes, in the dark, when father {{came to our}} rescue, and I do not recall being sent on a similar expedition thereafter. I think mother protested against the danger of it. Her notions of our training were less rigorous.|$|E

60|$|As Dave, Roger, and Ben tramped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> {{grass to}} where was located a knoll of {{considerable}} size, {{the son of}} the Crumville real estate dealer related how he and Dunston Porter had arrived in the construction camp and how they had gotten Frank Andrews to show them in what direction our hero and the senator's son had gone.|$|E
60|$|Up came Chris, {{and while}} he rummaged in the well-packed basket, Corny slipped into the wood, leaving the good lady with her thanks half spoken, sitting on a warm stone beside a muddy little pool.

60|$|As {{the result}} of this {{decision}} Captain Loch was sent out, at twelve o'clock on the following day, to reconnoitre the position.

Climbing this, they obtained {{a good view of the}} enemy's stockade and camp behind it.|$|E

60|$|Fifty or sixty {{yards from}} the house Levi stopped and a second figure arose from the black shadow in {{the angle of the}} worm fence and joined him. They stood for a while talking together, Levi {{pointing}} now and then toward the mill. Then the two turned, and, climbing over the fence, cut across an open field and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall,</b> shaggy grass toward the southeast.|$|E
60|$|With {{extreme caution}} the two chums {{worked their way}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass {{to the edge of}} the roadway. Then, {{watching}} their chance when nobody seemed to be looking, they dashed to the other side and into the grass again. Then they began to work their way cautiously in the direction of the group of buildings into which the former moving-picture actor had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed the}} door of the great marble chamber about which they found guards and eunuchs lying dead; they passed down the stairways, and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> gates where more {{soldiers}} lay dead, and looking behind them, saw that the palace was in flames. They reached the square without, and at the command of Kepher entered into a litter, and were borne by black slaves whither they knew not.|$|E

60|$|From {{the first}} moment of their {{conversation}} a horrible misgiving had come over me. It seemed more than confirmed as I gazed at what lay before me. It was a little square box made of some dark wood, and ribbed with brass. I suppose {{it was about the}} size of a cubic foot. It reminded me of a pistol-case, only it was decidedly higher. There was an appendage to it, however, on which my eyes were riveted, and which suggested the pistol itself rather than its receptacle. This was a trigger-like arrangement upon the lid, to which a coil of string was attached. Beside this trigger there was a small square aperture <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wood. <b>The</b> <b>tall</b> man, Flannigan, as his companion called him, applied his eye to this, and peered in for several minutes with an expression of intense anxiety upon his face.|$|R
60|$|A mile or {{more ahead}} of them, {{the line of}} warriors was {{creeping}} like a giant caterpillar <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grasses of the plain. Beyond, grazing herds of zebra, hartebeest, and topi dotted the level landscape, while closer to the river a bull buffalo, his head and shoulders protruding from the reeds watched the advancing blacks for a moment, only to turn at last and disappear into {{the safety of his}} dank and gloomy retreat.|$|E
60|$|He {{left her}} {{and went to}} the library, where Osborn sat at the big oak table with some letters and a wine glass in front of him. The spacious room was mostly in shadow, but a ray of fading light shone in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> west window. Gerald avoided the {{illumination}} as he advanced, and stopped in the gloom opposite Osborn, who straightened his body with a jerk and upset the glass.|$|E
60|$|He {{dismissed}} all the flunkeys {{with the}} exception of Monsieur Achille, who led the way through the reception rooms toward milor's private suite. Lord and Lady Eglinton followed in silence now. The rooms seemed strangely silent and deserted, ghostlike too, for there was no artificial light, and the moon peered in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> windows, throwing patches of pale mauve and weird, translucent greens on the parquet floor and the brocade coverings of the chairs.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{population}} lives on the southeastern {{side of the island}} in Godøy and Leitebakk, although the small fishing village of Alnes, with the old Alnes Lighthouse, is located {{on the north side of}} the island about 3 km away via a tunnel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 436 m <b>tall</b> mountain Sloktinden.

6000|$|Six {{more years}} had passed over the Dragon court, when, one fine summer evening, as the old walls rang with the merriment of the young boys at play, there entered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gateway a <b>tall,</b> well- equipped, soldierly figure, which caught {{the eyes of the}} little armourer world in a moment. [...] "Oh, that's a real Milan helmet!" [...] exclaimed the one lad.|$|R
50|$|Bishir also {{comments}} {{on the need for}} ventilation in coastal North Carolina, which she argues motivated some, including Burgwin, to adapt the Georgian style based on the architecture of the Caribbean.  Many Carolina settlers had early starts in this tropical region, or had roots that extended to the area.  That, coupled with the constant trade with the area for enslaved peoples, sugar, molasses, and other necessities, influenced the architectural elements seen in Wilmington today.  Such elements includes the wide hallways to allow breezes to flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> structure, <b>tall</b> ceilings, <b>the</b> prominent piazzas, an attic that allowed for rising heat to move away from living quarters, and a raised elevation.|$|R
