5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> well separated {{on the sides}} of the head.|$|E
5|$|From the front, the {{antennae}} and antennules are visible. Beside these {{there are}} the orbits in which <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> situated. The mouthparts comprise three pairs of maxillipeds, behind which there are a pair of maxillae, a pair of maxillules, and finally the mandibles.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found {{along the bottom of}} the arms, and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> more developed.|$|E
5000|$|The cheek mucosal lining over <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{opened and}} <b>the</b> inner {{contents}} of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> removed ...|$|R
50|$|EyesClear, dark brown, {{the corner}} of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> not lifted. In red (golden <b>eye)</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> golden/yellow.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
5|$|The head bears {{two pairs}} of antennae, {{the first of which}} is often biramous (branching into two parts) and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often {{flattened}} into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The mouthparts consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of mouthparts) and maxillae. Usually a pair of stalked compound eyes is present, although in some taxa <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> unstalked, reduced or lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
5000|$|For Series 13 <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> exactly <b>the</b> {{same shape}} and size as the {{previous}} series. The centre of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> a 3D purple sphere that had a white glowing pupil. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> separated into multi-coloured sections that would rotate and spin during the title sequence, {{at the beginning and}} end and also when the day and time was being announced by narrator Marcus Bentley.|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} visually {{following a}} three-dimensional moving object (2). Simultaneously, {{the position of}} the viewing angle of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> measured and <b>the</b> movement of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> determined. <b>The</b> measured <b>eye</b> movement <b>is</b> compared with the object movement. Preferably, the three-dimensional moving image is generated using a three-dimensional computer display (1). The position of the angle of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> measured using <b>the</b> reflected images of a light source (3) on <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> surfaces. USE - E. g. for determining ability of stereoscopic view, testing reactions. ADVANTAGE - Does not require analysis of patient's reactions...|$|R
25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> refracted by a different angle and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> light enters normally and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> able to focus correctly.|$|R
5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> the first to be conquered.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> 27 cm wide, with a lens 12 cm across. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>eye</b> of any known animal. These {{measurements}} {{are of the}} partly collapsed specimen; when living <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> probably 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) across.|$|R
5000|$|... "Monks, the All is aflame. What All <b>is</b> aflame? <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> aflame. Forms are aflame. Consciousness at <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> aflame. Contact at <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> aflame. And {{whatever}} {{there is}} that arises in dependence on contact at <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> - experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain - that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Liem et al., the {{organogenesis}} of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{pointed out}} {{as an example of}} a developmental cascade of inductions. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> essentially a derivative of the ectoderm from the somatic ectoderm and neural tube, with a succession of inductions by the chordamesoderm.|$|R
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object in different directions. This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in web pages rather than stored {{as a separate}} file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a binary image is base64-encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it as a standard. Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one <b>eye</b> affects <b>the</b> {{diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
5000|$|According to the year-spanning maxiseries [...] "52" [...] (2006), <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>was</b> once a real <b>eye</b> for <b>the</b> cosmic entity called [...] "Ekron". But, somehow Emerald Empress got <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> {{and got it}} to {{work for}} her. In the 52 weekly series, Lobo kept <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> in a box while {{watching}} it. Soon Starfire used it to stop villains from destroying an entire space sector. Lobo revealed that <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> Emerald Head of Ekron, that {{was a member of}} the Green Lantern Corps, until driven insane by his space sector being destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> an early prototype for the power rings.|$|R
5000|$|The fibrous tunic {{consists}} of the sclera and cornea and protects <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> sclera (white of <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>is</b> made up of elastin and collagen. The cornea (clear covering {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>is</b> made up of connective tissue and bathed in lacrimal fluid and aqueous humor, which provides it nutrition, as it does not have access to blood vessels.|$|R
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{located at}} the sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> grey, with a bronzy or {{yellowish}} cast.|$|R
50|$|To summarize, {{the actions}} of the {{superior}} oblique muscle are (1) depression of the eyeball, especially when <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted; and (2) intorsion of the eyeball, especially when <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted. <b>The</b> clinical consequences of weakness in the superior oblique (caused, for example, by fourth nerve palsies) are discussed below.|$|R
50|$|In strong {{tropical}} cyclones, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized by}} light winds and clear skies, surrounded {{on all sides}} by a towering, symmetric eyewall. In weaker tropical cyclones, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> less well defined and can {{be covered by the}} central dense overcast, an area of high, thick clouds that show up brightly on satellite imagery. Weaker or disorganized storms may also feature an eyewall that does not completely encircle <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> or have an eye that features heavy rain. In all storms, however, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> location of the storm's minimum barometric pressure - where the atmospheric pressure at sea level is the lowest.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above <b>the</b> <b>eyes)</b> <b>are</b> well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
60|$|Here is an Arabian vase, {{in which}} the {{pleasure}} given to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> only by lines;--no effect of light, or of color, is attempted. Here is a moonlight by Turner, {{in which the}}re are no lines at all, and no colors at all. The pleasure given to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> only by modes of light and shade, or effects of light. Finally, here is an early Florentine painting, {{in which there are}} no lines of importance, and no effect of light whatever; but all the pleasure given to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in gayety and variety of color.|$|R
