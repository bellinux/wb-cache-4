500|$|On 13 October 2005, the Swedish Academy {{announced}} that it had decided to award the Nobel Prize in Literature for that year to Pinter, who [...] "in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms". Its selection instigated some public controversy and criticism relating both to characteristics of Pinter's work and to his politics. [...] When interviewed that day about his reaction to the announcement, Pinter said: [...] "I was told today {{that one of the}} Sky channels said <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>that</b> 'Harold Pinter is dead.' [...] Then they changed their mind and said, 'No, he's won the Nobel prize.' So I've risen from the dead." [...] The Nobel Prize Awards Ceremony [...] and related events throughout Scandinavia took place in December 2005. [...] After the Academy notified Pinter of his award, he had planned to travel to Stockholm to present his Nobel Lecture in person. In November, however, his doctor sent him to hospital and barred such travel, after a serious infection was diagnosed. Pinter's publisher, Stephen Page of Faber and Faber, accepted the Nobel Diploma and Nobel Medal at the Awards Ceremony in his place.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>that</b> she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
500|$|AJ is a mechanic, who is {{described}} as a [...] who [...] "never misses an opportunity for excitement." [...] He is characterised as a free-spirited, fun-loving and carefree rebel, who does not always realise how his spontaneity affects other people. He {{is described}} as cheeky, irresponsible, a bad influence, a joker, a charmer and a talker. It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him, is fun to be around and could be running away from life. A writer for the BBC said that he lives [...] "like there's no tomorrow", and makes decisions {{based on the results of}} a coin flip. The coin, described as [...] "lucky", is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay, in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin, though one friend does not know that both sides of the coin are the same. Ganatra stated in an interview on <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>that</b> he did not think that the two sides of AJ's coin were the same. Sharma described AJ as [...] "the clown who loves to play" [...] and [...] "a little bit of a hippy", saying [...] "he's got a real wheeler-dealer, Del Boy aspect to his character." [...] He has twice compared AJ to a puppy dog, because he is nice but annoying, and he is fun but a nuisance. Sharma, who was brought up in Newport, said that [...] "the charm, humour and personality" [...] of Welsh people he knew helped him to create the character of AJ.|$|E

2500|$|..... Within {{forty-eight hours}} {{after the death of}} the late King, two {{relatives}} of Seni Pramoj, first his nephew and later his wife, came to the Legation and stated categorically their conviction that the King had been assassinated at the instigation of the Prime Minister (Pridi Phanomyong). It was of course clear that they had been sent by Seni. I felt it necessary to state to both of them in the strongest terms, {{in order to make it}} perfectly clear that this Legation could not be drawn into Siamese political intrigues, that I did not believe these stories and that I considered the circulation at this time of fantastic rumors un-supported by a shred of evidence to be wholly in-excusable. The British Minister informed me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>that</b> he had also been approached by several members of the Opposition to whom he had stated that he accepted the official account of the King's death and that he would not be drawn into any further discussion of the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Kat is {{described}} as [...] "a bit of a floozy", [...] "a bitch" [...] and [...] "very lazy". The EastEnders website says {{that as soon as}} Kat arrived in Walford with her [...] "fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of [...] "Viagra to the men of Albert Square". Richie revealed in an interview with <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>that</b> Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is [...] "going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps." [...] At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned.|$|E

An EastEnders spokesperson said, [...] "We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will {{do the right thing and}} Tommy will be reunited with Kat." [...] Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was [...] "just doing her job". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then we go home. It's drama, that's it." [...] She also praised Womack's acting and vowed to move on to [...] "bigger and better things" [...] after she departed. She added: [...] " [...] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best." ...|$|E
