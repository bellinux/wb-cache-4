5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo {{has been}} criticised as {{presenting}} the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing {{a class of}} African children. [...] "My dear friends," [...] he says, [...] "I am going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> today about your fatherland: Belgium." [...] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, [...] "I portrayed these Africans according to... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time." [...] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as [...] "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals", although Thompson noted her quote may have been [...] "taken out of context".|$|E
500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E

2500|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about AIDS, and {{not about}} AIDS in China or Africa, but AIDS {{right here in}} this country, where black {{women between the ages of}} 25 and 44 are 13 times more likely to die of the disease than their counterparts.

2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E
2500|$|He was a {{polarizing}} figure; many on {{the right}} wished to see him disbarred, while {{many on the}} left admired him as a [...] "symbol {{of a certain kind}} of radical lawyer." [...] Even some other civil rights lawyers regarded Kunstler as a [...] "publicity hound and a hit-and-run lawyer" [...] who [...] "brings cases on Page 1 and wins them on Page 68." [...] Legal writer Sidney Zion quipped that Kunstler was [...] "one of the few lawyers in town who knows how to talk to the press. His stories always check out and he's not afraid <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and he's got credibility—although you've got to ask sometimes, 'Bill, is it really true?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his {{departure}} from Taipei, Aquino gave an interview from his {{room at the}} Grand Hotel in which he indicated {{that he would be}} wearing a bulletproof vest. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: [...] "You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of 3 or 4 minutes it could be all over, and I may not be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again after this." [...] His last few moments in the flight while being interviewed by the journalist Jim Laurie, and just prior to disembarking from the flight at Manila airport, were recorded on camera.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 March 2005, Crowe {{revealed}} to GQ magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him {{prior to the}} 73rd Academy Awards in March 2001, {{and told him that}} the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've got <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now before you do anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" [...] Crowe recalled that: [...] "It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marcos wanted Aquino to {{stay out}} of politics, however Aquino {{asserted}} his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, [...] "the Filipino is worth dying for." [...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I may not be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.
