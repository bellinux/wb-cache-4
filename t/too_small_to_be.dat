5|$|While some list S.scutellata as inedible, others list it {{as having}} an unknown edibility. David Arora {{considers}} it <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of any culinary interest, and it lacks a distinctive smell or taste.|$|E
5|$|Created and {{expanded}} {{from the core}} troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards, the central field armies by 295AD {{seem to have been}} too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
50|$|Stuart Samuel also {{suggested}} that the experiment did not actually measure the speed of gravity because the effects <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> measured. A response by Kopeikin and Fomalont challenges this opinion.|$|R

50|$|In 1991 it {{was decided}} that the former De Meer Stadion of Ajax, {{situated}} in Watergraafsmeer would be replaced by the new Amsterdam ArenA, which in turn called for new training grounds for both the amateur and youth teams of the club. Sportpark Voorland, situated behind the old stadium was considered <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demolished <b>to</b> make room for housing.|$|R
5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy {{is necessary to}} eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that is, to achieve a cure.|$|E
5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at {{the eastern end of}} a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena acicula are {{considered}} inedible, as they <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> and insubstantial <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered for consumption.|$|R
50|$|Hand-pulling is {{effective}} against small infestations (gloves must <b>be</b> worn <b>to</b> {{protect against the}} caustic sap); shrubs too large or <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> pull must <b>be</b> dug out.|$|R
50|$|As Rockaway Boulevard cuts diagonally {{through the}} {{rectangular}} street grid of southeastern Queens, triangular intersections that <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> develop <b>were</b> designated as parks. These include Legion Triangle, Dixon Triangle, Ruoff Triangle, Corporal Ruoff Square, Wellbrook Triangle, O'Connell Square, Catholic War Veterans Triangle, and Sergeant Colyer Square. Larger parks {{along the route}} include Playground One Forty, Baisley Pond Park, and Idlewild Park.|$|R
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a black hole.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} toponym <b>is</b> used, today, <b>to</b> connote {{the village}} in Galway, but presumably was adopted from a nearby hill. The village <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> known far afield, and the surname is largely restricted in Ireland to County Galway. Ó Creachmhaoil, therefore, is presumably a Toponymic surname adopted by villagers from Creachmhaoil upon their moving {{to other parts of}} Galway.|$|R
40|$|Seery and Lidsey have {{calculated}} the three-point correlator {{of the light}} scalar fields, a few Hubble times after horizon exit during inflation. Lyth and Rodriguez have {{calculated the}} contribution of this correlator to the three-point correlator of the primordial curvature perturbation. We calculate an upper bound on that contribution, showing that it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observable...|$|R
50|$|Bark {{from a tree}} outside Worledge's {{window was}} found on her bedroom floor. A small hole had been cut in the flyscreen of her window, but {{forensic}} tests revealed {{that it had been}} cut from the inside. Police believed the hole <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> used by the abductor, and scientific evidence found it unlikely that Worledge was taken through her open bedroom window.|$|R
5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen otherwise.|$|E
40|$|Explanations of {{the origin}} of ultra-high energy cosmic rays are {{severely}} constrained by the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz’min effect, which limits their propagation over cosmological distances. We argue that possible departures from strict Lorentz invariance, <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> detected otherwise, can affect elementary-particle kinematics so as to suppress or forbid inelastic collisions of cosmic-ray nucleons with background photons. Thereby can the GZK cutoff be relaxed or removed...|$|R
50|$|As new Asian malls such as Yaohan Centre and President Plaza opened, it {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that the original Aberdeen Centre <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> compete. It <b>was</b> demolished in 2001, and was rebuilt for approximately $130 million.|$|R
50|$|Ray <b>was</b> meant <b>to</b> {{appear in}} My Sister Eileen as The Wreck but {{walked off the}} set {{claiming}} his role <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced by Dick York.|$|R
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|The dark shyshark poses {{no danger}} to humans and is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of {{commercial}} importance. Many are hooked by sport fishers casting from the shore, who regard the shark as a pest and often kill it. It {{may also be}} caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and bottom trawls, though not in substantial quantities. This shark occasionally finds {{its way into the}} aquarium trade, though there is no direct fishing for this purpose. As the dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact the entire population.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{relatively}} simple method, I compute the v/c correction to the gravitational time delay for light passing by a massive object moving with speed v, and I find disagreement with previously published results.

50|$|The {{rear-facing}} hook of a Lochaber axe <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> used <b>to</b> pull a person. In later {{examples of}} the weapon, particularly those used by the city guards of Edinburgh, the hook is almost level with {{the top of the}} staff, making them useless as a means to catch a moving object. These hooks, however, may have <b>been</b> used <b>to</b> hang the weapons in the guard room.|$|R

5|$|The raid on Christmas {{night was}} the last major Japanese attack on the Marianas. On January2, a single Japanese {{aircraft}} destroyed one B-29 and damaged another three. A further two small raids were attempted in January and one on February2, but none of five aircraft dispatched reached the islands and four were shot down. In early February the 6thAir Army's parent headquarters, the General Defense Command (GDC), reached {{the conclusion that the}} raiding forces being dispatched against the American bomber bases were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective. As {{it was not possible to}} allocate additional aircraft to bolster these missions, the GDC directed that the offensive cease and that the 6thAir Army be held in reserve to be used against any Allied forces which landed in the Japanese home islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
