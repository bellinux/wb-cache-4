2500|$|In 1878 Carl Scheibler {{became the}} head of the {{fertilizer}} department. Scheibler introduced an inexpensive fertilizer known as Thomas phosphate. This fertilizer was based on <b>Thomas</b> <b>slag,</b> named after Sidney Gilchrist Thomas. This new, inexpensive fertilizer allowed even poor farmers to fertilize their fields. At the same time municipalities began to use the waste products of the production of town gas for themselves or were selling them for profits, forcing Vorster & Grüneberg to gradually close their ammonium sulfate factories at other locations over the next fifteen years. In contrast, the factory in Kalk continued its expansion with new production facilities for sulfuric acid and nitric acid opening in 1881. In 1885 Carl Scheibler founded his own company, Düngerfabrik C. Scheibler & Co, [...] with the participation of the owners of Vorster & Grüneberg. This company produced Thomas phosphate and other fertilizers in domestic and international production facilities.|$|E

30|$|Tetracalcium {{phosphate}} or tetracalcium diorthophosphate monoxide (Ca 4 (PO 4) 2 O; the IUPAC name is tetracalcium oxide bis(orthophosphate); {{the mineral}} hilgenstockite) {{is the most}} basic CaPO 4, however, its solubility in water is {{higher than that of}} HA (Table  1). TTCP has been known since 1883 (Hilgenstock 1883), while the mineral hilgenstockite was named to honor a German metallurgist Gustav Hilgenstock (1844 – 1913), who first discovered it in <b>Thomas</b> <b>slag</b> from blast furnaces (Hilgenstock 1883, 1887). Its major industrial importance {{stems from the fact that}} it is formed by the reactions between orthophosphates and lime in the manufacture of iron, and through these reactions, TTCP has a significant role in controlling the properties of the metal.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetal {{immobilization}} {{may contribute}} to the environmental management strategy of dredged sediment landfill sites contaminated by metals. In a field experiment, amendment effects and efficiency were investigated, focusing on plants, springtails and bacteria colonisation, metal extractability and sediment ecotoxicity. Conversely to hydroxylapatite (HA, 3 % DW), the addition of <b>Thomas</b> Basic <b>Slag</b> (TBS, 5 % DW) to a 5 -yr deposited sediment contaminated with Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb and As resulted in a decrease in the 0. 01  M Ca(NO(3)) (2) -extractable concentrations of Cd and Zn. Shoot Cd and Zn concentration in Calamagrostis epigejos, the dominant plant species, also decreased in the presence of TBS. The addition of TBS and HA reduced sediment ecotoxicity and improved the growth of the total bacterial population. Hydroxylapatite improved plant species richness and diversity and decreased antioxidant enzymes in C.  Epigejos and Urtica dïoica. Collembolan communities did not differ in abundance and diversity between the different treatments...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhytostabilisation (combined use of {{tolerant}} {{plants and}} soil amendments) experiments were {{conducted at the}} field scale on dredged sediments polluted with metals. A sediment deposit contaminated with metals and metalloids (Cd, Zn, Pb, Cu and As) was experimentally established in 2002 and monitored until 2004 {{as part of the}} European project PHYTODEC (5 th Framework Program; EVK 1 -CT- 1999 - 2004). Six out of nine plots were treated by adding amendments to immobilise metals (<b>Thomas</b> Basic <b>Slags</b> or Hydroxylapatite). Two grass species (Festuca rubra and Deschampsia cespitosa) were sown on six plots previously treated or not. The three unvegetated plots left were taken as controls. After two years of monitoring, the couple Thomas Basic Slags/D. cespitosa was the most efficient additive/plant couple for phytostabilisation purpose. In this 3 years project, we continue to work on the sediment deposit site previously described and propose to demonstrate the long-term sustainability of phytostabilisation by addressing the following points: (i) sustainability and maintenance of the vegetation cover and amendment action, (ii) reduction of metals mobility and bioavailability, (iii) study of metal mobilization and immobilization mechanisms related to specific bacterial microflora...|$|R
30|$|BE {{additions}} {{were found}} not to significantly increase the aboveground biomass of wheat plants or the uptake of P when plants were fertilised with recycled fertiliser products. This was shown across {{a range of}} pot experiments with soils of different P status. Only {{in the case of the}} positive control P fertiliser (TSP) was a positive effect of Proradix and RhizoVital on plant growth observed in one of the experiments, while in the same experiment RhizoVital and Biological fertiliser DC had a negative impact on plant biomass when the P fertiliser was Thomas phosphate. With regard to P uptake, there was only a slight positive effect of Proradix in plants not supplied with P fertiliser in this experiment. Clear differences were seen in the efficiency of P fertilisers. Generally, sewage sludge ash performed quite poorly (20 – 40 % of TSP), while sewage sludge, <b>Thomas</b> phosphate, P-enriched <b>slag</b> and the fibre fraction of pig manure all had a high availability of P (> 74 % relative to TSP). Compost composed mainly of garden/park waste and sewage sludge was intermediate in availability (40 – 70 %). The elemental composition of the harvested wheat plants was significantly affected in all cases by the different P fertilisers added. The BE treatments significantly affected the elemental composition of the aboveground biomass in one of the experiments where the product Proradix had the greatest effect on elemental composition.|$|R
40|$|A {{fertilisation}} {{experiment was}} started in the French Alps on an acid grassland at 2000 m in 1989 where lime as calcium carbonate (liming) and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Slag</b> enriched by potassium chloride (fertilisation) was added in a random block design until 1992. Since then, no further amendments were applied. Fifteen years after the last application, we revisited the experiment and observed that soil pH was still significantly higher on limed plots, while nitrogen (N) concentrations were lower. On fertilised plots, soil carbon (C) and N concentrations were lower compared to unfertilised plots. However, litter quality (C and N concentrations, near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS] data) was similar for both treatments. Vegetation composition, but not species richness, nor Shannon-Wiener or evenness differed between limed and unlimed plots, and fertilised and unfertilised plots. Liming explained about 18 % and fertilisation about 6 % of the variability of the vegetation composition. These changes in the vegetation composition are probably due to lower abundances of former dominant grass species and {{to an increase in}} generalist grasses. However, these changes did not influence the total aboveground productivity, which was similar for all treatments. Tissue N and C concentrations and NIRS data indicated a changed chemical composition of the biomass which persisted during time. We conclude that the three years of fertilisation and liming did substantially influence the vegetation composition at our site and lead to an increase in the agricultural value of the grassland. These changes are long-lasting as they changed key features of the functioning in the soil of grasslands ecosystems. From an ecological point of view, specialised vegetation was replaced by generalist species leading to a trivialisation of the vegetation...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} Steinach Grassland Experiment {{is probably}} one of the oldest still-running fertilised grass experiments in continental Europe. The experiment was established on an alluvial meadow Alopecurus pratensis in southeastern Germany in 1933. The meadow was divided into 75 plots and fertilised with both mineral and organic fertilisers of differing compositions and amounts. The aim of this study was to provide more detailed information about the effects of long-term fertilisation by natrium (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on the contents of risk elements in soil. The effects of long-term fertilisation were investigated in the extracts of a) plant-available elements (extraction of CaCl 2), b) easily mobilised elements (extraction of EDTA), c) potentially mobilisable elements (extraction of HNO 3), the total concentration of elements (extraction of Aqua regia). Concentrations of risk elements As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn in the soil profile has increased substantially due to the phosphorus fertilisation; however, the limits for total trace elements concentration as set by the Czech legislation have been exceeded only twice, namely in the case of As and Cd. The total concentration of As (AsT) has been exceeded only once, on the plot fertilised only by nitrogen. The assumption is that that the increased level of AsT fraction in soil was probably caused in the past by fertilising with <b>Thomas</b> <b>slag</b> which is known to contain elevated concentrations of As. However, fertilising with the phosphorus-containing fertilisers has had the opposite effect on concentrations of Mn, Ni and Zn that are easily available to plants; concentrations of these elements in the soil extraction were substantially higher. In spite of the overall concentrations of Cd being lower than the Czech legislative standards, the results on several plots fertilised by mineral and organic fertilisers containing N, P and K showed higher concentrations of Cd and in one case reached the limit value. Plots fertilised by mineral fertilisers N 160 P 44 K 174 (NH 4) 2 SO 4 recorded higher Cr concentrations. In overview, it could be stated that under various types of fertilising no substantial effects of long-term fertiliser applications on a higher content of risk elements in soil has been detected. Only two plots have exceeded the limits set by Notice 13 / 1994 Sb., in one case it was a total concentration of As and in another one that of Cd...|$|E
40|$|Iniciando a publicação dos ensaios destinados a determinar a eficiência relativa de diversos fosfatos na adubação do algodoeiro, os autores apresentam os resultados obtidos nos que foram começados antes de 1941. Na presente série figuram seis ensaios, dos quais sòmente cinco foram aproveitados para verificar o efeito sôbre a produção. Conforme o ensaio, as doses de P 2 O 5 variaram entre 60 e 90 kg/ha e foram sempre empregadas na presença de azôto e potássio. Êsses ensaios foram instalados em terra-roxa-raisturada ou massapê-salmourão e conduzidos por três ou mais anos nos mesmos canteiros. Com exceção de Rofosfato e Cibrafosfato, que se mostraram um pouco inferiores, os demais adubos estudados - superfosfato em pó ou granulado, fosfato precipitado, Renâniafosfato, Germâniafosfato, Serranafosfato, escórias de Thomas, farinha de ossos crus ou degelatinados - deram resultados praticamente iguais. Todavia, o pequeno número de ensaios deste grupo e as condições em que êles foram realizados não permitem tirar conclusões definitivas sôbre o assunto. Em quatro ensaios foram incluídos canteiros adubados sòmente com azôto e potássio, podendo-se verificar que o efeito médio do fósforo sôbre a produção foi muito bom em dois e verdadeiramente espetacular nos outros dois. Nestes últimos, o efeito sôbre o pêso e a altura das plantas também foi grande, embora bem menor que na produção. Quando a primeira colheita foi efetuada cedo, pôde-se observar que a marcha da frutificação foi muito mais acelerada nas plantas que receberam fósforo. Êste nutriente também aumentou consideràvelmente o pêso dos capulhos, mas praticamente não modificou a porcentagem de fibra e o comprimento desta. The {{relative}} efficiency of various phosphorus fertilizers for cotton {{has been tested}} by the Instituto Agrônomico since many years. In this paper the authors report the results obtained in the first series consisting in six experiments started before 1941, five {{of which can be}} utilized to show the effects on the yields. The latter were conducted in the same plots for three or more seasons. The yearly applications of P 2 O 5 varied according to the experiment from 60 to 90 kilograms per hectare and were always used in the presence of nitrogen and potash. The various phosphates tested, including ordinary and granulated superphosphate, precipitated phosphate, Rhenaniaphosphate, <b>Thomas</b> <b>slag,</b> and bone meal, gave practically the same results. The authors warn, however, that the small number of experiments and the conditions under which they were conducted do not as yet permit to draw definite conclusions on the subject. In four trials, which included plots fertilized only with nitrogen and potash, the mean effect of phosphorus on the yield of seed cotton varied from fair to very high. The latter offered an excellent opportunity for verifying the influence of phosphorus on some characteristics of the cotton plant and its fruits. Phosphorus increased also the weight and height of the plants, but not so much as the yield of seed cotton. When the first picking was made early, it was observed that phosphorus hastened the fruiting march. Phosphorus increased the weight of the bolls, but did not practically affect the lint percentage and length. The residual effect of phosphorus was determined in two of the experiments. Although they were conducted on the "terra-roxa-misturada" type of soil, that effect was high and no difference was observed between that of superphosphate and the relatively insoluble phosphates...|$|E
