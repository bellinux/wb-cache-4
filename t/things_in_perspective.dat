500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective.</b> It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective.</b> There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective.</b> Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brian Damien Spukowski (Brian Posehn) – Sarah's gay {{neighbor}} and friend, who is dating Steve, is an enthusiastic metalhead {{but the only}} song on his five-year-old iPod is the Spin Doctors' [...] "Two Princes". Brian claims it's a palate-cleanser {{to prevent him from}} going psycho from listening to only metal. In the first episode, he claims to be bisexual, which causes some strain with Steve. Following a near-death experience, when Sarah crashes their car, Brian tells Steve that the event put <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective</b> and that he remains gay. Brian takes karate lessons, but only uses his skills when he sees it is necessary (and not to defend Steve, episode [...] "Humanitarian of the Year"). He and Steve occasionally double date with Laura and Jay, which they secretly dread. Brian attended Valley Village High School with Sarah, Steve, and Laura. In the episode [...] "Nightmayor", he and Steve get married.|$|E
2500|$|The 1983 {{short film}} Mickey's Christmas Carol marked the {{theatrical}} debut {{of the late}} Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who {{was the voice of}} Mickey until his death in 2009. Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: [...] "The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective.</b> He said, 'Just remember kid, you're only filling in for the boss.' And that's the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy." [...] Allwine would eventually marry Russi Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse since 1986. Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, [...] "Down and Out with Donald Duck" [...] and [...] "DTV Valentine" [...] in the mid-1980s. Peter Renaday voiced Mickey in the 1980s Disney albums Yankee Doodle Mickey and Mickey Mouse Splashdance. He also provided his voice for The Talking Mickey Mouse toy in 1986.|$|E
60|$|The {{arrangement}} of <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> a space is effected {{by means of}} the differences between the appearances of a given <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the various <b>perspectives.</b> Suppose, say, that a certain penny appears in a number of different perspectives; in some it looks larger and in some smaller, in some it looks circular, in others it presents the appearance of an ellipse of varying eccentricity. We may collect together all those <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> which the appearance of the penny is circular. These we will place on one straight line, ordering them in a series by the variations in the apparent size of the penny. Those <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> which the penny appears as a straight line of a certain thickness will similarly be placed upon a plane (though in this case there will be many different <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> which the penny is of the same size; when one arrangement is completed these will form a circle concentric with the penny), and ordered as before by the apparent size of the penny. By such means, all those <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> which the penny presents a visual appearance can be arranged in a three-dimensional spatial order. Experience shows that the same spatial order of perspectives would have resulted if, instead of the penny, we had chosen any other <b>thing</b> which appeared <b>in</b> all the <b>perspectives</b> <b>in</b> question, or any other method of utilising the differences between the appearances of the same <b>things</b> <b>in</b> different <b>perspectives.</b> It is this empirical fact which has made it possible to construct the one all-embracing space of physics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first rule}} of Isotype is that greater {{quantities}} are not represented by an enlarged pictogram but by {{a greater number of}} the same-sized pictogram. In Neurath’s view, variation in size does not allow accurate comparison (what is to be compared - height/length or area?) whereas repeated pictograms, which always represent a fixed value within a certain chart, can be counted if necessary. Isotype pictograms almost never depicted <b>things</b> <b>in</b> [...] <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> order to preserve this clarity, and there were other guidelines for graphic configuration and use of colour. The best exposition of Isotype technique remains Otto Neurath’s book International picture language (1936).|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective.</b> [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year.

50|$|Ryan is 17 year-old {{played by}} Lenny Ross. An ardent gamer, Ryan is quite an irresponsible and lazy punk who spends {{too much time}} at gaming shops and too little time in school. Opinionated, Ryan is also often strong headed about many <b>things</b> <b>in</b> his <b>perspective</b> and as such often quarrels with the other vocal people around him with strong personalities. In part, {{this is due to}} his American accent while {{spending}} his younger years growing up in Los Angeles, before finally settling in Singapore.

60|$|Let us now {{endeavour}} {{to state}} {{the fact that the}} aspect which a thing presents at a given place is affected by the intervening medium. The aspects of a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> different <b>perspectives</b> are to be conceived as spreading outwards from the place where the thing is, and undergoing various changes as they get further away from this place. The laws according to which they change cannot be stated if we only take account of the aspects that are near the thing, but require that we should also take account {{of the things that are}} at the places from which these aspects appear. This empirical fact can, therefore, be interpreted in terms of our construction.|$|R

40|$|We discuss Boltzmann’s {{explanation}} of the irreversible thermodynamic evolution of macroscopic systems {{on the basis of}} time-symmetric microscopic laws, providing a comprehensive presentation of what we call the typicality account. We then discuss the connection between this general scheme and the H-theorem, demonstrating the conceptual continuity between them. In our analysis, a special focus lies on the crucial role of typicality. Putting <b>things</b> <b>in</b> wider <b>perspective,</b> we go on to analyze the philosophical dimensions of this concept, explaining the connection between typicality and probability, and demonstrate its relevance for scientific reasoning, in particular for understanding the supervenience of macroscopic laws on micro- scopic laws. The second part of the paper responds to recent objections against the typicality account that have been raised in the philosophical literature. In par- ticular, the concept of ergodicity, or a variant thereof, named “epsilon-ergodicity”, which has been promoted by some authors as a crucial additional assumption on the dynamics, is shown to be of no use for its intended purpose...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of medicine and its allied sciences continues to unfold new questions for juridical response from the contemporary jurists.

However, a reflective survey of the existing literature reveals {{that when it comes to}} reconciling the scientific findings with the purport of textual imperatives, the jurists by and large go bipolar, namely, either accept them all in sundry or reject them in totality. This state of affairs, among other medico-ethical implications, tends to have far-reaching implications for Muslim families particularly if they want to make a choice between such contrasting positions.

40|$|Queueing Theory {{has been}} {{attacked}} on two fronts. Some theoreticians say that Queueing Theory is closed. Some practitioners {{feel that there}} is very little in it for use. In view of this, it seems that after six decades of development it is time for stock taking. It is hoped that a discussion of the problems, achievements and the shortcomings of Queueing Theory will be helpful for both theorists and practitioners by putting <b>things</b> <b>in</b> proper <b>perspective.</b> This paper reviews some of the major strides taken by Queueing Theory with respect to its three constituent problems: (i) Behavioral, (ii) Statistical, and (iii) Operational. If one looks at the general picture of the developments in these areas it is hard not to conclude that, in spite of the practitioners' accusations, the systems studied have become more and more realistic over the years. This review makes an attempt to bring this out. An extensive bibliography which is directive in nature rather than exhaustive should be helpful to an interested researcher or a practitioner in identifying the articles of his interest. A discussion of the future of Queueing Theory concludes the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} both an {{introduction}} to this special issue of The Contemporary Pacific and a more general reflection about francophone research in the Pacific Islands and about their cultures and populations. The common topic of the essays selected here is the difficulty of maintaining an indigenous identity within the French colonial system in the French or francophone islands of the Pacific (New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna). Four contributions from contemporary scholars of New Caledonia and French Polynesia bring their research on the cultural, social, and political struggles of their interlocutors to better visibility for a broad, largely anglophone audience in Pacific studies. The Resources section, produced by the chief librarians of the University of New Caledonia and the University of French Polynesia, provides a very useful overview of bibliographic and research materials about these two territories. Putting <b>things</b> <b>in</b> broader <b>perspective,</b> this introduction discusses {{what may be a}} common denominator in research work produced by francophone scholars that makes it distinctly different from the work of Anglophones. As well, it raises the epistemological issue of the political commitment of researchers born in the francophone Pacific Islands or living there on a permanent basis...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the gender inequalities in sport, {{specifically}} with the inadequate representation of women in management and decision-making positions in national sport organisations.

On the basis of the carried out quantitative research, in which first the typology of sport organisations using the cluster analysis was created and then consequently the results of the gender analysis of the management structure were applied to it. It is possible to claim that sport organisations contribute to maintaining the masculine culture of sport. The main indicator is the predominance of men both in membership and mainly in the management of sport organisations, in which men strongly dominate, apart from sports, which are explicitly considered as feminine. In the background of the discovered results lies the gender significance of sport in society, i. e. whether it is a men's or women's sport, as well as the organisational culture of each sport organisation, which is closely linked with the social policy of the given country. The results of the thesis, which [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1984 World Series was {{scheduled}} to start in the National League park.

Although one cannot be sure of the exact strain that leads to a specific episode of collective behavior, the idea of relative deprivation as a type and/or source of strain is very useful. If one utilized the idea of relative deprivation, especially progressive deprivation: a period of increased gains followed by a stoppage or reversal of such gains, it becomes much clearer why these riots took place...|$|R
