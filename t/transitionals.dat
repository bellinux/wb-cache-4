5000|$|Suffice to say {{a number}} of {{progressively}} different transitional Conn saxophones were produced as designs evolved. Sometimes these design differences are obvious; for example, early transitional models have split bell-keys compared to later ones with the single-sided 6M and 10M bell-key layout, whilst both types may have a [...] "nail-file" [...] G# key. A more subtle difference is that very late-production <b>transitionals</b> have a Conn 10M [...] "shot glass" [...] style octave-key vent on the neck {{as opposed to the}} earlier dome-shaped octave vent found on the New Wonder II. When examining early-model transitional saxophones the differences can be quite minor (closely resembling the New Wonder Series II, except for having a modified high E-key on the side) and therefore detailed background knowledge is required to correctly identify them. Unless the owner knows which design features to look for, both early and late-model Conn <b>transitionals</b> can be misidentified under the all-encompassing label of [...] "Chu Berry saxophone". As a result, the official Conn model names used by the manufacturer are preferred, because there is a clear, accurate definition and therefore the possibility of misunderstanding is much reduced.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Chu Berry saxophone" [...] is {{misleading}} (and therefore potentially meaningless) {{because it has}} no accurate and universally agreed definition. This easily causes confusion; for example, to non-experts, the Conn New Wonder Series II looks {{very similar to the}} New Wonder Series I or the [...] "New Invention" [...] model of around 1910. To complicate matters further, there was no abrupt cut-off point between the New Wonder Series II and the 6M or 10M. Instead, there was a gradual evolution in the design. Between 1930 and 1934 (approximately serial numbers 244700 to 260999) Conn manufactured around 17,000 [...] "Transitional" [...] (or [...] "cross-over") models. Most of these so-called [...] "Transitional" [...] saxophones were altos and they combine some features of the New Wonder Series II with others from the later Conn 6M (alto) and 10M (tenor) designs - in varying percentages. For example, early <b>transitionals</b> can be 80/20 New Wonder II and 10M, others are 60/40 or 50/50, whilst the later ones are 30/70 etc.|$|E

The reproductive parameters that were examined included the operational (reproductive) sex ratio and size and age structure of mature females, sex-changing individuals (<b>transitionals),</b> and mature males. There was {{a greater proportion of}} males above the minimum size and age of harvest on reefs closed to fishing for 8 - 10 years than on reefs open to fishing, although the effect varied with geographic region. Nevertheless, neither the sex ratio, mean age, nor mean size of males or <b>transitionals</b> varied significantly with reef closure status. Females, however, were significantly older and larger on closed than on open reefs in both regions. Marked regional variations in the sex ratio and average age of <b>transitionals</b> were found independent of reef closure status, suggesting regional variation in reproductive strategies.

In this study, assemblages from various behavioural groups {{are used to}} test the hypothesis that non-agriculturalists had a characteristic pattern of tooth wear which differs from the pattern of tooth wear of agriculturalists. The current study used an updated method to measure the proportions of dentine exposed in the occlusal wear facet and compared this to approximal wear and occlusal wear plane angle (separately). Assemblages used were from different behavioural groups (non-agriculturalists, <b>transitionals</b> and agriculturalists), environments (inland and coastal) and regions (North America and Levant). The non-agricultural groups were made up of assemblages from Carlston Annis, Ciggerville, El Wad, Indian Knoll and Kebara.

40|$|In vertebrates, gonadal steroids play a {{fundamental}} role in sex differentiation, sexual maturation and reproductive behaviour. In teleost females, sex steroids {{are involved in}} the regulation of vitellogenesis and oocyte final maturation with increasing plasma levels through the reproductive cycle. In gonochoric species a possible role of 11 ß-hydroxylation on male sexual determination has been suggested. In hermaphrodite protogynous fish, the intersexual stage appears to be characterised by a 11 ketotestosterone decrease and a 11 ß hydroxyandrostenedione increase. Till now, few endocrinological studies on sexual steroids in ambisexual fish are available and none on the protogynous hermaphrodite Epinephelus marginatus. This study reports on plasma levels of sex steroids during the spawning period in relation to sex and maturity stages in a wild population of E. marginatus. Gonad specimens (n= 91), Bouin’s fixed, and related plasma samples, were submitted to histological studies and to RIAs for sex steroids. 17 ß-estradiol (17 ß-E), testosterone (T), 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) and 11 ß-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 ß-OHA) were assayed. Oocytes at different stages of development in mature females during the reproductive period were observed together with the presence of high 17 ß-E and T plasma levels. Plasma levels of 17 ß-E in males remained low through the reproductive period. In transitional, 17 ß-estradiol levels were lower than in females but higher than in males. Increasing values of 11 ß-OHA were observed in <b>transitionals</b> at the beginning of sex inversion with gonads characterised by previtellogenic oocytes and extensive proliferation of interstitial tissue. Plasma levels of 11 -KT were higher in males than in <b>transitionals</b> and in vitellogenic females. In conclusion, 17 ß-E and T, taken together, could be considered as good indicators of functional gonad state in E. marginatus. 11 ß-hydroxyandrostenedione appeared to be the most reliable marker of sex inversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{squaretail}} coralgrouper Plectropomus areolatus {{was identified as}} a fast-growing, early maturing and relatively short-lived aggregation-spawning epinephelid. Examinations of sectioned otoliths found females and males first maturing at 2 and 3 years, respectively, suggesting protogynous hermaphroditism; however, no <b>transitionals</b> were observed in samples. Age distribution for the two sexes was similar and both were represented in the oldest age class; however, significant sex-specific differences in size-at-age were identified. Both sexes fully recruit into the fishery at age 4 years and reach 90 % of asymptotic length by age 3 years. Underwater visual assessments, combined with the gonado-somatic indices, revealed a 5 month reproductive season, with interannual variability observed in the month of highest density within the spawning aggregation. Catch restrictions on adults during spawning times and at reproductive sites, combined with gear-based management and enhanced enforcement, are recommended to maintain spawning stocks.

The Herschel Space Observatory provides an unique opportunity for studying the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. In this work we update previous knowledge on the <b>transitional</b> disks in the Chamaeleon I and II regions with data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. Methods. We propose a new method for <b>transitional</b> disk classification based on the WISE 12 [*]μm − PACS 70 [*]μm color, together with inspection of the Herschel images. We applied this method to the population of Class II sources in the Chamaeleon region and studied the spectral energy distributions of the <b>transitional</b> disks in the sample. We also built the median spectral energy distribution of Class II objects in these regions for comparison with <b>transitional</b> disks. Results. The proposed method allows a clear separation of the known <b>transitional</b> disks from the Class II sources. We find six <b>transitional</b> disks, all previously known, and identify five objects previously thought to be <b>transitional</b> as possibly non-transitional. We find higher fluxes at the PACS wavelengths in the sample of <b>transitional</b> disks than those of Class II objects. Conclusions.

The sensitivity and spatial resolution of Herschel reveals a significant contamination level among the previously identified <b>transitional</b> disk candidates for the two regions, which calls for a revision of previous samples of <b>transitional</b> disks in other regions.

40|$|The gonadal {{ontogeny}} through sex differentiation {{and transition}} of three protogynous coral trout species, Plectropomus leopardus, P. maculatus and P. laevis was described, based on anatomical and germinal differences {{along the length}} of the reproductive tract. Gonads of immature and mature females, sex changing individuals (<b>transitionals)</b> and males were examined. Specific anatomical features that were compared between sexual phases included the presence and structure of sperm sinuses, gonadal musculature and germinal cell types. All three coral trout species first differentiated as an immature female. The sexual pattern of P. leopardus and P. maculatus was concluded to be diandric protogynous hermaphroditism (males were derived from the juvenile phase as well as through sex change of mature females). Plectropomus laevis was found to be monandric as males were only derived through sex change in mature females. Structural changes did not occur concomitantly with the germinal changes associated with sex change in these Plectropomus species, which is atypical for protogynous species described to date. Precursory sperm sinuses in the dorso-medial region of the gonad were present, although non-functional, in a proportion of immature and mature females of all three species. These proportions, however, varied between species depending on the sexual pattern. The structural and germinal changes observed were hypothesized as anatomical adaptations that aid in minimizing time spent in the (non-reproductive) sexual transition phase and maximizing flexibility in male development in the diandric species...|$|E
40|$|How in {{the world}} could a whale evolve from some land-dwelling four-legged animal? On the basis of a number of other {{apparent}} transitions between other groups of animals, inferred from a number of intermediate forms, along with several other lines of evidence, it has long been asserted by scientists that whales HAD to do this too, that in fact ALL living things have evolved from earlier forms over vast periods of time. Dissenters have pointed out the many unique features of whales, perfectly adapted to their very special oceanic niche, and have claimed {{that there is no way}} such magnificent creatures could have developed by gradual changes over time from a totally different kind of animal. This view has been seemingly confirmed by the absence of any fossils which might be considered as intermediates, or <b>transitionals,</b> between any land-dwelling ancestors and the whales of today. Therefore, they must have been specially created by an “intelligent designer”. However, as you may have already learned, such appeal to some supernatural explanation for any natural phenomenon cannot be used in any scientific argument, simply because, whether such a cause exists or not, it cannot be disproven by any scientific testing.

Females ranged from 76 - 297 mm FL (mean FL= 156 mm, n= 1420), males ranged from 141 - 361 mm FL (mean FL= 244 mm, n= 297), and <b>transitionals</b> ranged from 131 - 307 mm FL (mean FL= 207 mm, n= 42).

Sagittal otoliths (sectioned and whole) from 1438 C. proridens were used to determine age. Marginal increment analysis suggested that a single annulus is formed each year in the spring. Ages ranged from 0 to 10 years with 88 % of the fish being between 0 and 4 years. Females ranged in age between 0 and 6 years, while males ranged between 1 and 10 years. Growth was rapid {{in the first two years}} and then began to slow down. The von Bertalanffy growth model fitted to all observed data was L[subscript (t) ]= 306 [1 -e[superscript - 0. 254 (t+ 1. 69) ]]. The data were further broken down into central and southern strata and the von Bertalanffy growth model showed that fish in the central region grow larger than those in the southern region. Histological analysis confirmed that C. proridens are protogynous hermaphrodites with delimited type gonads. Estimates indicated that 50 % of the females in the sample had transitioned into males by age 4 and a FL of 231 mm. Calamus proridens mature at a small size; 50 % of the samples were mature by 132 mm and within the first year. The samples obtained indicated that the peak spawning season is in the spring.

Nowadays, transitional spaces are pivotal in non-residential architecture {{and the proportion of}} such areas may vary between 10 % up to 40 % of the total volume depending on the typology. Mixed-mode buildings are desings with by both active and passive systems. The necessity of buildings’ energy demand and consumption reduction is a tangible fact after the entry into force of the EPBD directive 31 / 2010 /EU. As a consequence buildings design went through the improvement of thermal envelope proprieties. In particular, for non-residential buildings this aspect combined with the increased level of internal gains has changed the energy balance: low heating demand compensated by an increased cooling demand not restricted to the only summer season. This evidence has stimulated a renewed interest in designers for the exploitation of natural ventilation as means of passive cooling solutions. Transitional spaces rely on a great potential for natural ventilation exploitation. They have direct connection with the outside, their architecture based on large volume suites with the principles for an effective natural ventilation. Because of the awareness of natural ventilation limitations, which relies on natural forces, the interest has progressively moved towards mixed-mode buildings. Mixed-mode buildings are indeed designed in such way that the HVAC system help to prevent uncomfortable conditions when natural ventilation is not sufficient to guarantee a comfortable environment.

40|$|Epinephelus (Cephalopholis) cruentatus (Lacépède, 1802) [Petrometopon cruentatum], the Graysby, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{groupers}} on the coral reef at the southwest coast of Curaçao. They are very abundant at a depth from 7 ½ to 9 m. A second, lower maximum in their vertical distribution is found at a depth of 30 m. Juveniles are found mainly at a depth of about 6 m in crevices of the coral species Montastrea annularis. The calculated number of fish actually present appeared to be 24 specimens in a transect of 240 m 2 at a depth of 9 m. Measurements were made of the percentage of bottom cover and of the quantity of coral structure. A strong correlation was found between both. For the studied coral reef in Curaçao a high percentage of bottom cover means at the same time a high quantity of structure and thus of hiding places for the Graysbys. A strong correlation (p < 0. 01) could be observed between the mean number of E. cruentatus and the mean percentage of bottom cover of the coral species M. annularis and Agaricia spp. These coral species have an important influence upon the vertical distribution of E. cruentatus by their growth form, which supplies hiding possibilities e. g. holes, overhangs, crevices. There is a suggestion of a movement in the population to shallower waters during the spawning season. In Curaçao the Graysbys appear to be diurnal. During the night they move deeper into caves and crevices of the reef. The most important food fish of the Graysby, Chromis multilineata, shows the same vertical distribution as its predator and seems also to be strongly determined by the percentage of cover of M. annularis and Agaricia. Otolith readings of E. cruentatus demonstrate that each year 3 growth rings are formed, the formation of which starts in September, January and June. Juveniles, however, form 7 growth rings a year. The translucent zones in the adults are formed in September, January and June, when food intake, condition factor and body growth is low. In the periods following these three months, the opaque zones are formed and this formation coincides with maxima in food intake, condition factor and body growth. Possibly a change in temperature is a factor in initiating a new growth ring. Growth in length and weight of the Graysbys occurs especially in February and to a lesser extent during July and October. The growth equation of Von Bertalanffy for E. cruentatus in Curaçao is: Lt = 41. 5 (1 — e- 0. 13 (t + 0. 94)). The total length-standard length relationship is expressed by the equation: y = 1. 2091 x + 0. 2326 and appears to be linear. The length-weight relationship found for the Graysbys is: W = 0. 0121 x TL 3. 0821, and is closely proportional to the cube of the length. The spawning season occurs from May to October. Mating takes place especially in August and September. Mature females are found mainly between 16 and 25 cm TL, at an age of 4 and 5 years, mature males between 21. 5 and 27. 4 cm TL in age group 6 and to a lesser extent in age groups 5 and 7, <b>transitionals</b> between 19. 5 and 23. 4 cm in age groups 4 and 5. For the <b>transitionals</b> in the length-range of 19. 5 - 23. 4 cm a transition rate of 10 % was found. This relatively high rate is linked with a high increase of numbers of males in this length-range. Transition occurs usually in September, and to a lesser extent during July, August and October, immediately after spawning. A sex-ratio of 2. 5 : 1 was observed for mature females and males. A significant correlation (p < 0. 01) exists between transition rate and sex-ratio. In general a strong dominance of females coincides with a relatively low transition rate and vice versa. Females spawn only once a season, whereas males spawn more frequently and can mate with more than one female. E. cruentatus feeds mainly on fish (75 %) and to a lesser extent on crustaceans (18 %). Juveniles, however, feed more on shrimps (80 %) than on fish. The equation found for the relation mean weight of stomach contents and size classes is: w = 0. 00567 x TL 3. 5917, this indicates that the weight of the stomach contents is a function of about the third power of the length. Graysbys show preference for Chromis multilineata (± 55 %). They feed especially at sunrise and sunset. Food intake varies considerably during the year and is in general high between February and August and lower in the rest of the year. In addition, minima in food intake can be observed in January, September, and possibly in June, and maxima in October-November, February-March and July. These minima and maxima in food intake correspond with time of ring formation in the otoliths. A significant correlation was found between food intake and condition factor during the year (p < 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2000. The family Serranidae is {{a diverse}} group of fishes, of which the genus Epinephelus (rockcods or groupers) is the largest. Serranids are {{commonly}} caught in reef fisheries in tropical and warm-temperate latitudes, and are targeted because of their tasty flesh and high value. In South Africa, epinepheline serranids mainly occur in hook and line fisheries in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. Mostserranids are caught by the boat-based (skiboat) fishery, and the commonestspecies are the endemic catface rockcod (Epinephelus andersoni), thehalfmoon rockcod (E. rivulatus), the yellowbelly rockcod (E. marginatus) and the endemic white-edge rockcod (E. albomarginatus). Although serranids contribute about ten percent to catches by the commercial and recreational skiboat sectors in KwaZulu-Natal, representing an estimated total catch of around 200 mt per year, little is known about these fishes in South Africa. From the mid- 1980 s to the mid- 1990 s, the mean lengths of E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus in the region declined significantly. Over this period, lengths of E. andersoni remained the same, while those of E. rivulatus increased. Lengths of E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus from Mozambique, where fishing effort was low at the time of sampling, were significantly greater than in KwaZulu-Natal. Monthly biological data were mostly collected from commercial skiboat catches on the northern and southern coast of KwaZulu-Natal. Additional data for E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus were also collected irregularly from commercial catches made in Mozambique. Unless the fish had ripe ovaries, all gonads had to be sectioned to establish sex and stage. Histology revealed that all gonads had a female-like appearance, with lamellae and a central lumen. In E. andersoni, there was a complete overlap of male and female length frequencies, and their meanlengths were not significantly different. Some males and inactive bisexuals were both smaller and younger than the female size and age at first maturity. Together with the occurrence of mature bisexual fish (<b>transitionals),</b> these observations indicate that males are derived from immature or mature females, hence this species is a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite. The other three species exhibit typical signs of monandric protogynous hermaphroditism. Males and females had significantly different mean lengths, and age and length frequencies by sex werebimodal. Transitional individuals were recorded in E. rivulatus. E. andersoni and E. rivulatus matured at small sizes and early ages relative to E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus. Ripe ovaries were much larger than ripe testes in all four species. E. andersoni, E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus spawned in spring and summer, while E. rivulatus spawned in winter and spring. There were no indications of spawning in E. andersoni in the southern sampling region, and few ripe individuals of E. albomarginatus were encountered in KwaZulu-Natal samples. Size at maturity of this species was much smaller in Mozambique samples. Large, reproductively inactive individuals of E. andersoni were frequently observed in the spawning season. The lack of reproductive activity of E. andersoni and E. albomarginatus in KwaZulu-Natal may be because this area represents thesouthernmost limit of the distribution of these species. Ageing of the four species was undertaken using sectioned otoliths. Age validation was undertaken by a combination of tetracycline marking in captive fishes, and analysis of the marginal zone in otoliths. All four species are relatively long-lived, although estimates of maximum age may be under-estimated because of long-term harvesting. In all four species, fish from the southern sampling region were larger than fish from the northern region at the same age. Only in the case of E. rivulatus were these significant enough to warrant the fitting of two growth curves to the northern and southern populations. Males in all four species tended to be larger than females at the same age, suggesting {{that there may be a}} growth spurt following sex change, or that faster-growing females changed sex. A logistic growth curve was fitted to the age-length data for E. andersoni, while von Bertalanffy curves produced the best fit for the other species. Based on the rates at which L∞ attained in these four species, E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus are slow-growing species, while E. andersoni and, particularly, E. rivulatus arefaster growing. Rates of total mortality and natural mortality were estimated using length-converted catch curves and the Rikhter and Efanov equation, respectively. Stock assessments undertaken by yield per recruit and spawner biomass per recruit analyses indicate that E. andersoni in KwaZulu-Natal is currently optimally exploited, while E. rivulatus is lightly exploited. Both E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus are over-exploited. The potential problems in applying standard per recruit models to species with complex life histories are discussed. Support for the reduced stock status of the latter two species is provided by the observed changes in lengths of these species over a ten-year period, and their relatively small size in KwaZulu-Natal compared to the lightly-fished Mozambique populations. Local fishers in KwaZulu-Natal have also reported declines in sizes and reduced catches of these two species. The life history styles and other features of the four species are compared and discussed with reference to the resilience of these species to harvesting. Two of the species (E. marginatus and E. albomarginatus) are monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, which grow slowly, mature late and attain large sizes. E. andersoni and E. rivulatus grow faster, mature earlier and are smaller species. The normally deleterious effects of fishing on sex-changing species are not manifested in these two species, possibly because E. rivulatus is so small, that males are not selectively removed. In contrast, E. andersoni is a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite, and hence, does not rely on sex-change as a source of males. The current management methods for serranids in KwaZulu-Natal are presented, and suggestions for future approaches are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} reappraisal of <b>transitional</b> justice through {{the study of}} the nature and {{function}} {{of the rule of law}} it conveys. As originally conceived, <b>transitional</b> justice embraces a concept of the rule of law that is sensitive to the conditions of the political transition, in which law is caught in inexorable tensions between the past and the future. Yet, the increasing use of <b>transitional</b> justice to deal with armed conflicts and human rights violations irrespective of any political transition has created a conceptual and normative disorder, which leads to assimilating the use of <b>transitional</b> mechanisms to that of <b>transitional</b> justice. Should <b>transitional</b> justice apply to situations other than those of political transition? In what other transition-like situations is a sui generis concept of the rule of law justified? Can <b>transitional</b> justice mechanisms be used in situations other than political transitions? The author analyzes these questions bearing in mind that an enlarged and unjustified use of <b>transitional</b> justice may render the concept of <b>transitional</b> justice analytically, descriptively, and normatively meaningless to law. The case study of Colombia shows the perverse effects of conceptual vagueness and brings to light the practical impacts that using an enlarged conception of <b>transitional</b> justice has upon the ordinary rule of law.
