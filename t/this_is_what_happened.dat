25|$|The {{owners and}} agents of Ariel and Taeping {{were well aware}} of the {{situation}} that the consignees were in. As soon as their ships had telegraphed from the Downs they became concerned that anything that might be considered a dead heat or a disputed result might lead the consignees to call the race void - there being no outright winner - and so not pay the premium for the first ship to dock. Therefore, they agreed that whichever ship docked first would claim and the other would not dispute the result in any way. In return, the two ships shared the premium between them, and also MacKinnon and Keay shared the £100 prize for the winning ship's captain. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> Taeping made the claim and shared the money equally with Ariel.|$|E
500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." [...] If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E

500|$|At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present {{inflated}} their expenses; in {{the opinion}} of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. [...] Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. [...] The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. [...] He called it one of [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] and amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. [...] It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. [...] Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. [...] When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as [...] "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. [...] However, when it was pointed out {{that this would be a}} less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decollated, [...] "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. [...] As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. [...] The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. [...] As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. [...] A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. [...] Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. [...] The plot was the last [...] crime for which the sentence was applied.|$|E

[...] In his eulogy at the funeral, the Rev.

In particular, it implies that Er is isomorphic to E∞. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in our first, trivial example of an unfiltered chain complex: The spectral sequence degenerated at the first sheet.

2500|$|When {{nearly half}} of Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the Cheka sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but they were {{captured}} and, after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 the Free Territory – Makhnovist region – was inundated with Red troops, including the 42nd Rifle Division and the Latvian & Estonian Division – in total at least 20,000 soldiers. Viktor Belash noted {{that even in the}} worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, [...] "In the majority of cases rank-and-file Red Army soldiers were set free". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release [...] "in all four directions" [...] captured Red Army soldiers. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in Huliaipole. To this it must be added that the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine included a choir of Estonian musicians. The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the Estonians by Anton Denikin's inflexible Russian chauvinism and their refusal to fight with Nikolai Yudenich.|$|E
2500|$|While {{a limited}} company is {{deemed to be}} a legal person {{separate}} from its shareholders and employees, {{as a matter of}} fact a company can only act through its employees, from the board of directors down. So there must be rules to attribute rights and duties to a company from its actors. This usually matters because an aggrieved third party will want to sue whoever has money to pay for breach of an obligation, and companies rather than their employees often have more money. Up until reforms in 2006 this area used to be complicated significantly by the requirement on companies to specify an objects clause for their business, for instance [...] "to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages". If companies acted outside their objects, for instance by giving a loan to build railways in Belgium, any such contracts were said to be ultra vires and consequently void. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in the early case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche. The policy was thought to protect shareholders and creditors, whose investments or credit would not be used for an unanticipated purpose. However, it soon became clear that the ultra vires rule restricted the flexibility of businesses to expand to meet market opportunities. Void contracts might unexpectedly and arbitrarily hinder business. So companies began to draft ever longer objects clauses, often adding an extra provision stating all objects must be construed as fully separate, or the company's objects include anything directors feel is reasonably incidental to the business. Now the 2006 Act states that companies are deemed to have unlimited objects, unless they opt for restrictions. The 2006 reforms have also clarified the legal position that if a company does have limited objects, an ultra vires act will cause the directors to have breached a duty to follow the constitution under section 171. So a shareholder who disagreed with an action outside the company's objects must sue directors for any loss. Contracts remain valid and third parties will be unaffected by this alone.|$|E
