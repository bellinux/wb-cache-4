40|$|Purpose: In {{wheelchair}} racing, {{respiratory muscles}} of the rib cage are concomitantly involved in non-ventilatory functions during wheelchair propulsion. However, the relationship between locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC: the ratio between push and breathing frequency), respiratory parameters and work efficiency is unknown. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the LRC in wheelchair racers over different race distances. Methods: Eight trained and experienced wheelchair racers completed three time-trials over the distances of 400 m, 800 m and 5000 m on a <b>training</b> <b>roller</b> in randomized order. During the time trials, ventilatory and gas exchange variables as well as push frequency were continu-ously registered to determine possible LRC strategies. Results: Four different coupling ratios were identified, namely 1 : 1; 2 : 1, 3 : 1 as well as a 1 : 1 / 2 : 1 alternating type, respectively. The 2 : 1 coupling was the most dominant type. The 1 : 1 / 2 : 1 alternating coupling type was found predominantly during the 400 m time-trial. Longer race distances tended to result in an in-creased coupling ratio (e. g., from 1 : 1 towards 2 : 1), and an increase in coupling ratio towards a more efficient respiration was found over the 5000 m distance. A significant correlation (r= 0. 80, p< 0. 05) between respiratory frequency and the respiratory equivalent for oxygen was found for the 400 m and the 800 m time-trials. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a higher coupling ratio indicates enhanced breathing work efficiency with a concomitant deeper and slower respiration during wheelchair racing. Thus, the selection of an appropriate LRC strategy may help to optimize wheelchair racing performance...|$|E

However, because the pavilion as a whole was deemed too expensive in light of the 1973 construction and opening of Pirates of the Caribbean, Baxter proposed severing the mine train and building it as a separate attraction.|$|R
