5|$|The Seven Crystal Balls was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé concluded the arc begun in this story with Prisoners of the Sun, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have ranked The Seven Crystal Balls {{as one of the}} best Adventures of Tintin, describing it as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> instalment in the series. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
25|$|By the First French Republic, {{artillery}} {{was recognized}} as one of the three main combat arms, alongside infantry and cavalry. During the Napoleonic era field artillery became the decisive element on many battlefields. At the crisis of the Battle of Wagram in 1809, Napoleon quickly formed a massed battery of 112 guns to fill a gap in his battle line. This stopped a dangerous Austrian attack in its tracks and helped to achieve victory. In 1800 French armies deployed about two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers. The ratio approached five guns per 1,000 by 1812 as the quality of French foot soldiers declined. Under Napoleon batteries usually included eight pieces and the 12-pounder was often employed in army and corps artillery reserves. A corps reserve battery often consisted of six 12-pounders and two howitzers. Another typical organization was four cannons and two howitzers. Napoleon lovingly called the 12-pounders his belles filles and increased their number. All field pieces had similar muzzle velocities but the 12-pounders had the greatest hitting power. They also made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> sound when discharged. Another attribute was their greater range. Some 8-pounders were replaced in order to increase the proportion of 12-pounders. At the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 Napoleon had 600 artillery pieces or three guns per 1,000, but the victorious Allies used 900 guns on that field.|$|E

500|$|The Finnish Civil War {{was fought}} {{primarily}} along the railways, the vital means of transporting troops and supplies. The strategically most important railway junction was [...] Haapamäki, northeast of Tampere, connecting both western-eastern and southern-northern Finland. The other vital junctions were Kouvola, Riihimäki, Tampere, Toijala and Viipuri. The Whites captured Haapamäki {{at the end}} of January 1918, leading to the Battle of Vilppula.

Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review called the ride the world's best drop tower, later ranking {{it one of the}} top 14 new attractions for 2014; Dave Parfitt and Arthur Levine of USA Today ranked Falcon's Fury in their top ten. Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times originally ranked Falcon's Fury his seventh-most-anticipated ride for 2014; on an updated list, he ranked it 17th.|$|E
500|$|Its {{influence}} is less obvious but still apparent in Out of Sight, a 1998 film directed by Steven Soderbergh.

[...] The film's imagery and stylistic techniques have served as an inspiration to films such as Schindler's List directed by Steven Spielberg, Memento by Christopher Nolan, The Dark by John Fawcett, Frozen by Juliet McKoen, Submarine by Richard Ayoade, and Snow White and the Huntsman by Rupert Sanders. David Cronenberg regards it as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> film he has seen, and its influence has been detected on Cronenberg's The Brood.|$|E

Every few steps he would stop short, glance wildly out from the dizzy height, and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race; and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy. He was a handsome fellow, and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror, but it was pitiful to see him suffer so.|$|R

Nikki Stafford, author of Bite Me! The Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer writes [...] "Hush" [...] is [...] "mind-blowing" [...] and [...] "one of the best hours of television ever". For Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney, the primary reason [...] "Hush" [...] was successful was the acting strengths of the central cast. [...] "Hush" [...] is Alyson Hannigan's (Willow) favorite episode of the Buffy series, and the one Nicholas Brendon (Xander) considers <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening.</b> Series writer Jane Espenson stated the episode [...] "redefined what an episode of television could do".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{described}} {{the game as}} frightening.

Allgame found the sound design particularly effective, calling it “absolutely, teeth-clenchingly disturbing", while PC Gamers William Harms christened System Shock 2 as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> game he had ever played. Some critics found the weapon degradation system to be irritating, {{and members of the}} development team have also expressed misgivings about the system. The role-playing system was another point of contention; GameSpot described the job system as [...] "badly unbalanced" [...] because the player can develop skills outside their career choice. Allgame felt similarly about the system, saying it [...] "leaned towards a hacker character".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} a {{tarantula}} walks over Bond was initially shot by pinning a bed {{to the wall}} and placing Sean Connery over it, with a protective glass between him and the spider. Director Young did not like the final results, so the scenes were interlaced with new footage featuring the tarantula over stuntman Bob Simmons. Simmons, who was uncredited for the film, described the scene as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> stunt he had ever performed. The book features a scene where Honey is tortured by being tied to the ground along with crabs, but since the crabs were sent frozen from the Caribbean, they did not move much during filming, so the scene was altered to have Honey slowly drowning. Simmons also served as the film's fight choreographer, employing a rough fighting style. The noted violence of Dr. No, which also included Bond shooting Dent in cold blood, caused producers to make adaptations to get an [...] "A" [...] rating – allowing minors to enter accompanied by an adult – from the British Board of Film Classification.|$|E

500|$|The album {{departed}} from the optimistic psychedelic soul sound of the group's 1960s records, instead embracing a darker sound featuring dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals. Stone reworked 1969's [...] "Thank You" [...] single as a slower, closing track, [...] "Thank You For Talking to Me Africa" [...] which, according to AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald was a blues and gospel influenced examination of urban tension {{and the end of}} the 1960s, [...] "perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> recording from the dawn of the 1970s, capturing all of the drama, ennui, and hedonism of the decade to come with almost a clairvoyant feel." [...] "Africa Talks to You" [...] is a nine-minute funk jam written in response to Sly Stone's backlash from estranged fans and friends, record industry associates, and the media. According to biographer Eddie Santiago, the lyrics cynically portray [...] "fame and its cold retrogression into perceived insanity", with a chorus that reflects [...] "Sly's feelings on being cut down in his prime like a tree in the forest." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{stature and}} {{following}} has grown steadily since its original release, and {{it now has}} cult movie status. [...] Director Martin Scorsese placed The Haunting first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Richard Johnson says that Steven Spielberg considers The Haunting one of the [...] "seminal films" [...] of his youth, and Robert Wise says that Spielberg told him The Haunting was [...] "the scariest film ever made!" [...] Richard Armstrong in Rough Guide to Film (2007) called it [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> films ever made", and said Julie Harris' performance is played [...] "with an intensity that is frightening in itself". In 2010, The Guardian newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. However, not all critics think so highly of the film; Yoram Allon and Neil LaBute have stated that they believe the film is [...] "frankly overrated", and professional filmmaker Russell Evans has argued that few people truly find the film shocking or disturbing. As of October 2014, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes scores the film with an 86% rating based on 36 reviews. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Robert Wise).|$|E

500|$|Jaws {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it}} [...] "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works {{all the better}} because it's populated with characters {{that have been developed}} into human beings". Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of using}} stunt doubles, De Bont persuaded Bullock, Patric, and Dafoe {{to perform their}} own stunts, so the scenes would appear more realistic; the lead actors were {{required}} to engage in physical exercise sessions before and during filming. [...] Stunt coordinator Dick Ziker was very impressed with Patric's stuntwork, {{and said that he}} [...] "is so physical he probably {{could be one of the}} top stunt men in the world". His stunts included being dragged by a seaplane through the water, jumping onto collapsing buildings, and scuba diving while pulled by a moving ship. He was also required to tread water for multiple hours at a time. [...] During a motorcycle stunt on a Ducati916 on the second day of filming, Patric flew off the bike [...] into the air and landed on a small bush; Bullock said the incident was so serious that Patric [...] "should be dead". [...] After surviving a traumatic surfing incident as a teenager, Bullock had to overcome her fear of water to perform necessary stuntwork in the film. During production at sea, Bullock was smacked into the ship on multiple occasions, and was saved by Patric from decapitation by the ship's rudder in one scene. Bullock and Patric also had a scene filmed in an underwater tank where they had to kiss underwater with Bullock's hands tied together. Navy SEALs with scuba gear were present inside the tank during shooting, as the actors had to hold their breath during the scene. According to Bullock, she performed all of her own stuntwork [...] "except for a quarter of one stunt"; her stunt double worked for only three days during production. Of all the stunt-related incidents during production, De Bont said <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>frightening</b> was when a stunt woman was hit in the face by a boat cable and required reconstructive surgery. Following the production at sea, De Bont said that filming on water [...] "was 100 percent more difficult than [...] imagined".|$|E

Manson family member Susan Atkins, who admitted her part in the murders, stated to police and before a grand jury that the house was chosen as the scene for the murders [...] "to instill fear into Terry Melcher because Terry had given us his word on a few things and never came through with them". In this aim, the Manson Family was successful. Melcher took to employing a bodyguard and told Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi that his fear was so great, he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment.
