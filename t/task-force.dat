40|$|Capabilities-based force {{aggregation}} using random sets Abstract — Force aggregation {{is one of}} {{the most}} important functionalities of a situation analysis system. In order to reduce the amount of information displayed for an analyst, it is vitally important to cluster information that belongs together and display the aggregated information for the cluster instead of all the original objects. In order to do this, two different kinds of algorithms are necessary. First, we must have a method for grouping objects that belong together. This problem is often referred to as clustering or association; it is a variant of the NP-complete graph coloring problem. Second, a group of objects that belong together must be classified. There have been some methods proposed for doing this. All of the present alternatives for aggregation rely on doctrinal information. However, in the new kind of situations that face us, it is increasingly likely that we will meet organizations that do not follow a strict doctrine in their organization. Instead, they will use <b>task-forces</b> or ad-hoc forces that are organized to solve a specific objective. Here, we present a formalism for doing classification of taskforces based on less amount of doctrinal knowledge. The kind of doctrinal knowledge required by the approach suggested here is similar to the one needed to put together <b>task-forces</b> for solving a specific mission, ie, it is capabilities oriented. Using random set theory, we describe several different ways of force aggregation and present results from experiments performed with them. User interaction could be used to further enhance the method presented here. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper is}} to raise {{awareness}} regarding legal loopholes and enabling technologies, which facilitate acts of cyber crime. In perusing these avenues of inquiry, the author seeks to identify systemic impediments which obstruct police investigations, prosecutions, and digital forensics interrogations. Existing academic research on this topic has tended to highlight theoretical perspectives when attempting to explain technology aided crime, rather than presenting practical insights from those actually tasked with working cyber crime cases. The author offers a grounded, pragmatic approach based on the in-depth experience gained serving with police <b>task-forces,</b> government agencies, and international organizations. The secondary objective of this research encourages policy makers to reevaluate strategies for combating the ubiquitous and evolving threat posed by cyber-criminality. Research in this paper has been guided by the firsthand global accounts (via the author’s core involvement in the preparation of the Comprehensive Study on Cyber crime (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2013) and is keenly focused on core issues of concern, as voiced by the international community. Further, a fictional case study is used as a vehicle to stimulate thinking and exemplify key points of reference. In this way, the author invites the reader to contemplate the reality of a cyber crime inquiry and the practical limits of the criminal justice process...|$|R

Contradictory data on the variability in individual response to different agents {{can be found in}} the literature. The objective of this report was to present a review of occupational exposure to anesthetic gases residue. ContentsThe results of the main articles on the subject, as well as the causes of contamination of the surgical environment, ventilation, exhaust system, monitoring, and dosage of anesthetic gases residues are discussed. Recommendations to minimize the supposed effects of inhalational agents are emphasized. ConclusionsEven in <b>task-forces</b> studies of renowned international regulating institutions, there are some controversies on the risks of occupational exposure to anesthetic gases residue. Minimal values for occupational exposure are stipulated, but acknowledging the lack of epidemiological evidence of any type of damage caused by said exposure in places where standard measures of ventilation and exhaust systems and the use of anesthetic equipment are observed. In our country, most of the time those measures are not implemented and, when they are, they are not supervised properly. Besides, differences in techniques and working conditions have to be considered. Taking into consideration the multifactorial nature of the exposure of health care professionals, measures should be undertaken to minimize occupational exposure to agents with known or probable toxic potential. The demand for better equipped operating rooms, with adequate ventilation and exhaust systems as well as their maintenance should be stimulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{design studio}} {{teaching}} is the pedagogical space where ideological settings become action rules and material procedures. When the students start to design, they unconsciously are putting in action {{a theoretical framework}} they acquired during their studies as future architects and during their existence as human beings and citizens. In the Collective Housing Design Studio this relationship between an ideological framework and a built and inhabited reality represents its pedagogic and didactic basement. Indeed is required to the student to stress some theoretical notions {{in order to see}} how the architecture discipline can answer to the complexity of a social request. In other words the Collective Housing Design Studio is the place where, more than ever, teaching architecture became architectural education. At the Faculty of Architecture of Oporto, the course of "Projecto 3 " is traditionally a Collective Housing Design Studio and represents, by his own professors and didactical processes, the heritage of a historical and almost unique experience between architects and ideological principles: the SAAL. After the Portuguese revolution of 25 th April, 1974, a strong housing need caused the creation of the SAAL (Local Support Service Ambulatory). The SAAL was a kind of architectural <b>task-forces</b> that operated in deteriorated and low income urban areas to design low cost housing for local people.

40|$|The {{remittance}} {{is on its}} way THE global {{great and}} good are obsessed with the "digital divide". Half the people in the world, they fret, have never made a telephone call. Africa has less international bandwidth than Brazil´s city of Sao Paulo. How, ask dozens of inter-governmental <b>task-forces,</b> can the poor get connected? Amid all the attention paid to developing countries´ lack of Internet access, some people feel that more fundamental problems are being ignored. Ted Turner, an American media boss, observed last year that {{there was no point in}} giving people computers when they had no electricity. He may be wrong. Indian scientists recently produced a prototype of a battery-powered device called the Simputer?short for ?simple computer??that is expected to cost only $ 200 a unit. Even at that price it may be too expensive for the truly poor. But computers can be shared. And the time may come when they will pay for themselves. Information and communication technology (ICT) may be overhyped, but it does matter. True, people in poor countries need food and medicine before they need Internet access, but ICT could help them lay hands on both of these more easily. In several fishing villages on the Bay of Bengal, for example, an Internet link-up allows a volunteer to read weather forecasts from the US Navy´s public website and broadcast them over a loudspeaker. For fishermen who work from little wooden boats, knowing that a storm is looming can mean the difference between life and death. The Internet also lets them know the market price for their catch, which helps them haggle with middlemen. And they can download satellite images revealing where fish shoals are. Communication, as everybody knows, is getting cheaper. Any task that can be digitised can now be done at a distance, which creates all sorts of opportunities for developing countries. Fixing software for a London firm does not require Indians to travel to Britain. They can do it from Bangalore. That is why India´s software industry has grown from almost nothing ten years ago into the most dynamic business on the subcontinent, employing 400, 000 people and generating more than $ 8 billion in sales last year. The country has almost as many fluent English speakers as England, and universities that turn out hordes of computer-literate graduates. Charging a small fraction of what Californians demand, Indian programmers fixed a large chunk of the world´s millennium-bug troubles, and take on a larger share of western companies´ back-room operations each year. Yuppie toys in rural Bangladesh Granted, these health-care schemes mostly depend on charity for their funding. And the lack of Internet content in languages other than English is a problem. But new websites in other languages pop up every day. And as the cost of ICT falls, it may not be long before poor people start clubbing together to buy time online with their own money. It has already happened with mobile telephones. For many Bangladeshi women, the mobile phone provides upward mobility. Women in rural areas borrow money from Grameen Bank, a microlender, to buy a GSM phone. Handsets can cost a year´s income for the whole household, but more than 90 % of borrowers are able to service their loans because they earn money charging other villagers to make calls. Everyone benefits. In Bangladesh as a whole, 97 % of homes lack a telephone. In rural areas, practically no one has a phone. So when a Grameen-backed phone entrepreneur sets up shop, the whole village is suddenly connected to the outside world. Parents can call the nearest city, for example, to find out what has happened to the remittance from their son working on a construction site in the Gulf. A telephone call can take the place of a long and expensive trip: one study found it typically saved between 3 % and 10 % of the caller´s monthly household income. The service also turns a profit. The callers may be poor, but because there are so many of them, rural phones in Bangladesh generate more revenue than urban ones. Grameen Phone, a Grameen Bank offshoot founded to provide services for the poor, now sells to everyone and has become the largest provider of mobile-phone services in Bangladesh. Mobile phones are popular everywhere, but in poor countries they have extra advantages. It is quicker and cheaper to sell a poor person a mobile telephone than to install a payphone in a remote village. A phone in someone´s house is constantly guarded, which makes it unlikely to be vandalised. Mobiles are user-friendly, too. Fixed-line telephone services in most developing countries are provided by awful state-owned monopolies. Ask for a telephone line to be installed in your home in Zimbabwe, and you can choose between bribing someone or waiting for several years. But if you walk into a mobile-phone shop, your handset will be up and running in five minutes. Nor is lack of a credit history a problem. Poor people are barred from opening accounts with traditional telephone companies because no one trusts them to pay their bills. With mobiles, however, they can buy pre-paid cards. When they have used up all their minutes, they buy another. There is no chance that they will receive an unmanageable bill at the end of the month. Because the mobile-phone companies get paid in advance, they waste no time or money on chasing bad debts, as fixed-line firms do. So their cashflow is better and they are able to expand their networks faster. In many poor countries the number of mobile users has overtaken the number of land-line users in less time than it takes to get a land line installed. In Uganda, for example, it took two years for MTN, a private mobile-phone firm, to outstrip UTL, the clumsy state-owned telecoms firm. Before it was privatised last year, UTL in a typical year lost 40 % of revenues in bad debts, and another 30 % because of "audit adjustments". In 1997 - 99, the number of land-line users in Uganda inched up from 54, 000 to 59, 000. Over the same period, the number of mobile users exploded from 7, 000 to 87, 000. This still means that only one Ugandan in 240 has a mobile phone, but it´s a start. And ICT is spreading faster than any technology in the whole of human history. In 1900, 24 years after the telephone was invented, only 5 % of homes in America were hooked up to the telephone network. In most other countries, the figure was negligible. Compare this with the spread of the Internet. In 2000, 18 years after the creation of a rudimentary Internet and 11 years after the beginning of the World Wide Web, 6. 7 % of the world´s population were logging on. In other words, the Internet is spreading around the whole world faster than the telephone spread around its richest country a century ago. The poor are catching up And poor countries, for once, are not missing out on this revolution. In 1998, according to the UNDP, only 12 % of Internet users were in non-OECD (ie, less developed) countries. By 2000 this proportion had almost doubled, to 21 %, when the cake itself had more than doubled in size over the same period. The Internet is not only a marvellous technology; it is a tool that helps developing countries to adopt outside technology faster, and sometimes to develop their own. The makers of the Simputer used free open-source software, which they could not have downloaded without the Internet. Indeed, without the Internet, open-source software would not exist, as it depends on large numbers of volunteer programmers swapping ideas online. In developing countries scientists are thin on the ground. A decade ago, if a researcher from a poor country wanted to bounce ideas off lots of other experts every day, he probably had to move to a rich country. Now he simply logs on. Cheaper communications mean more north-south collaboration, and indeed more south-south collaboration. In 1995 - 97, American scientists co-wrote papers with colleagues from 173 other countries. Kenyans published papers with scientists from 81 other nations. The Internet also allows more collaboration within countries. Brazilian biologists work with colleagues at opposite ends of the Amazon river and on both sides of the equator. Some of them surprised the world last year by sequencing the genome of a bacterium that shrivels oranges. It was the first time that a free-living plant pathogen had been sequenced anywhere, a breakthrough for southern-hemisphere science. According to Andrew Simpson, one of the project´s leaders and an old Brazil hand, this would not have been possible without the Internet. "It´s a godsend," he says. "It gives us confidence that what we are doing is as good as what is going on in America, because we can see what is going on in America.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} of security-based {{transnational}} approaches to combating terrorist activity and propaganda have demonstrated that these alone are ineffective. Sometimes, security measures can actually damage efforts to roll back the appeal and take-up of violent extremism. While such measures should be used in domestic contexts where threats are critical or imminent, failure to accompany these with robust “soft power” initiatives will prove fatal in the longer-term. Business as usual is not an option. Here is what needs to change if we are to succeed in countering violent extremism. 1. Rethink current approaches to creating a counter-narrative Counter-narrative remains a key strategy in the struggle to diminish violent extremism’s appeal, especially for young people. Governments around the world have been slow to respond to community needs and desires regarding this. Most governments now accept that credible counter-narratives must be community- rather than government-generated. Yet many agencies have remained ambivalent about forming genuine partnerships with community organisations that can develop authentic counter-narratives to reach and, more importantly, influence those at risk. Communities have tuned out to the “negative case” made by standard counter-narratives. They are seeking more “affirmative” narratives that offer genuine alternatives to hatred, enmity and terror. Greater effort is needed to promote social inclusion and community belonging for those who feel marginalised and disempowered. This involves focusing on what binds us together rather than on what divides us. An inclusive narrative must acknowledge the social and political idealism that makes some young people vulnerable to dimensions of terrorist messaging that promise a new or better world. We must offer genuine alternative forms of social activism and transformation, which explicitly reject violence while seeking change. 2. Follow the lead of Germany and Denmark in rehabilitating returned fighters Counter-narratives are not just about what we say but also what we do. This includes how we treat those returning from foreign conflicts. While it is clear that some foreign fighters return home hardened and committed to violent extremism, others do not. They find themselves disillusioned by the gap between the propaganda and the reality of foreign conflict. Rehabilitation for this latter group is essential. The Hayat program in Germany and the Aarhus program in Denmark are good examples of how to bypass over-securitisation of returned fighters and instead offer counselling, support and rehabilitation. These programs acknowledge the different reasons people participate in foreign conflicts. These reasons include idealism, humanitarianism and peer pressure, as well as a commitment to violent extremism as an ideology. A key benefit of rehabilitating returnees is that they have greater credibility with potential recruits and can positively influence them. Embracing those who respond to rehabilitation demonstrates the principles of a supportive society. That in itself is a powerful message to undermine the narrative of alienation, isolation and rejection that terrorist recruiters promote. 3. Assertively challenge media’s role in fostering disunity and xenophobia Some media reporting can severely undermine the crucial message of social inclusion by amplifying xenophobia, eroding trust and promoting social disharmony. The more coverage of terrorist-related issues demonises Muslim communities at large, the more entrenched a victim mentality can become for those targeted by sensationalised coverage. The sense of being “under siege” by media is experienced by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims around the world. This produces frustration, humiliation and fear for these communities and can actually increase radicalisation leading to violent extremism. Such coverage also encourages attacks on ordinary Muslims in diaspora communities because it appears to legitimise such actions. Those who experience such targeting become more mistrustful of the democracies in which they live. This makes them less likely to co-operate with authorities, even when they have important information or views to share. The “us and them” narratives of much media reporting need to be confronted assertively, by governments as much as by communities. 4. Demystify the ‘special nature’ of violent extremism Part of the appeal of violent extremism is that it seems to transcend ordinary criminal violence. It is characterised as a higher form of social action, in which forms of social, religious and ideological power and aspiration combine to reach beyond the ordinary and everyday. An effective way to diminish the appeal of violent extremism is to demonstrate that it is no different from other, more mundane violence. Stripped of its romanticised trappings as a higher calling, violent extremism should be treated as part of a broad-spectrum campaign against violence of all kinds. This approach exposes the ordinariness of violence, its consequences and its failure to achieve the promise of social change that lures many young people. 5. Use social media more often, more strategically and more creatively Social media outlets have been exploited by those promoting online dimensions of radicalisation and violent extremism. Sustained effort to challenge extremist messaging and representation through social media has been lacking, yet examples of effective strategies do exist. Programs such as All Together Now in Australia and Exit in Europe are leading the way in helping disengage those on pathways to extremism through social media. While in democratic countries censorship of social media remains untenable for excellent reasons, much more could be done, more nimbly and more creatively, to use social media as a counter-strategy. If, as some leading research has argued, terrorism is a communicative act, then we need to invest seriously in challenging and disrupting its messaging using the same communication channels and strategies. A key element here is embracing multimodal communication platforms that combine image, text and sound to reach people {{in the same way that}} sophisticated violent extremist propaganda routinely achieves. 6. Develop cognitive and emotional skills to deconstruct extremist ideology Education is a key to disrupting and dismantling terrorist ideology. In an age awash with information, media and diverse forms of knowledge, many young people struggle with the critical skills required to sift, sort and evaluate it all. These cognitive and emotional skills need to be comprehensively embedded in the curricula of schools and universities. The goal must be to equip young people to evaluate and argue against the interpretations of religion, history, politics and identity that are the bread and butter of terrorist recruitment narratives. Nor should we stop at the cognitive domain in thinking about how best to skill up our youth to critique and reject violent extremist ideology. Terrorist messaging does not just target the head. It focuses in increasingly sophisticated ways on the heart through visual and aural communication. Understanding the nexus between cognition and emotion, and developing in young people the understanding and ability to step back and analyse before acting, should be a primary focus of any counter-terrorism strategy. 7. Understanding the ‘supply chain’ means targeting recruiters Recruiters are the middle-men and women in the supply chain of violent extremism. Counter-terrorism strategies have tended to focus on grassroots initiatives to prevent the take-up of violent extremism at community level, while “disrupt and degrade” efforts have concentrated on the leadership of terrorist groups. Focusing on remote figureheads may help score largely symbolic goals for governments and <b>task-forces.</b> But the middle-men and women, as always, are the linchpin. Without them the leaders cannot marshal the human resources to execute their strategies. Targeting recruiters should not just be about removing them from circulation – as a securitisation model would propose. It should also aim to undermine their influence with alternatives that speak to the deeper needs and desires of those susceptible to their influence. It is vital to work with communities to identify, understand the strategies of and disempower locally influential recruiters in order to nullify their messages and reduce their reach and appeal. 8. Women are emerging as key players in violent extremism Programs to counter violent extremism tend to focus on alienated, angry young men and the ways that certain constructs of masculinity and violence may be linked. But the complexities of contemporary violent extremism have increasingly seen women emerge as influential players – as spokespeople, recruiters, enablers and in some instances as fighters. While female fighters and violent extremists are hardly new, complex issues involving power, disenfranchisement and agency for women are making themselves felt in new ways. Strategies relying on the assumption that women are generally key influencers away from violent extremism need to be rethought. While this may be true in some instances, the increased involvement of women in terrorist propaganda and social influence suggests a more complex social and gendered territory. It raises the question of whether we need to develop more nuanced, gendered strategies of countering violent extremism. 9. Community, community, community All of the previous points require deep, long-lasting, inclusive partnerships with communities at a grassroots level. A signal weakness in transnational strategies to date has been the tendency of government agencies to focus relationship-building efforts on selected community leaders. These leaders, while important in some instances, are only part of the story. Communities are increasingly telling us that an older generation of leaders lacks the credibility, authority or authenticity to work effectively with younger community members who are radicalising towards violence. The central issue of trust – the single most important element in brokering successful joint efforts between governments and communities to mitigate violent extremism – goes well beyond developing trust and engagement with a relatively small number of community leaders. They may sometimes lack the backing of critical elements within their own constituencies. We must be smarter, more expansive and more multi-layered in developing community relationships. A multi-level strategy – one that targets and builds grassroots trust, transparency and engagement as well as cultivating leadership roles and government liaison – is far more likely to succeed in tackling violent extremism than one that is narrowly focused on selected representatives and structures. These structures often exclude women, young people and voices of difference or dissent within communities. These groups are precisely those we need to engage if we are to mount credible alternatives to violent extremism. This means listening carefully and genuinely to what communities are saying, and adopting not only a “whole of government” but a “whole of community” strategy. 10. Help researchers by sharing key data and information National security expert Marc Sageman recently published an essay calling for greater leverage of research capacity by government agencies concerned with countering violent extremism. Sageman focuses on ways in which government agencies 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to share primary source data have stalled research capabilities – an essential contribution to the evidence base on which strategies, policies and programs are founded. Intelligence agencies have the empirical data but not the methodological skills to analyse and interpret these; researchers have the analytical and methodological skills but lack the data. The result is that breakthroughs in understanding terrorism and how to counter it are being impeded. A smart strategy would develop security-sensitive ways of giving researchers the data they need. This would help spur transnational effectiveness by enabling researchers to develop the large, robust datasets and theoretical underpinnings that are essential to serious inquiry in this space. Without this, research remains a severely under-utilised resource.
