25|$|In August 1991, {{only weeks}} after a state visit by President Bush, reactionary {{members of the}} Communist Party and a few {{high-ranking}} officers {{of the military and}} KGB attempted to seize power and restore the old dictatorship.

25|$|On 10 September 1987, after {{a lecture}} from hard-liner Yegor Ligachev at the Politburo for {{allowing}} two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin {{wrote a letter}} of resignation <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> who was holidaying on the Black Sea. When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned {{from the ranks of}} the Politburo. Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider.|$|E
25|$|The {{tension between}} Soviet Union and Russian SFSR {{authorities}} {{came to be}} personified in the bitter power struggle between Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Squeezed out of Union politics by Gorbachev in 1987, Yeltsin, who represented himself as a committed democrat, presented a significant opposition <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> authority. In a remarkable reversal of fortunes, he gained election {{as chairman of the}} Russian republic's new Supreme Soviet in May 1990. The following month, he secured legislation giving Russian laws priority over Soviet laws and withholding two-thirds of the budget. In the first Russian presidential election in 1991 Yeltsin became president of the Russian SFSR.|$|E
5000|$|The war in Afghanistan, often {{referred}} to as the Soviet Union's [...] "Vietnam War", led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added motive force <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> glasnost and perestroika reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.|$|R

25|$|Gorbachev {{calls for}} a kind of perestroika or {{restructuring}} of societies around the world, starting in particular with that of the United States, because he is of the view that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 shows that the Washington Consensus economic model is a failure that will sooner or later have to be replaced. According <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> countries that have rejected the Washington Consensus and the International Monetary Fund approach to economic development, such as Brazil and China, have done far better economically on the whole and achieved far fairer results for the average citizen than countries that have accepted it.|$|E
25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> Yeltsin {{kept the}} {{plans of the}} Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. Gorbachev has also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It also ordered the Russian deputies in the Council of the Union to cease their work, leaving that body without a quorum. In effect, the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded.|$|E

500|$|According to Swedish {{economist}} Anders Åslund, Ryzhkov differed {{little from}} Gorbachev {{when it came}} to price reform. There were, however, subtle differences between the two men's views, with Ryzhkov supporting an administratively controlled price increase while Gorbachev, as a radical economist who supported market reform, opposed such measures. As Hough noted, Ryzhkov supported [...] "the need for greater fiscal responsibility", while Gorbachev advocated the need for more rational prices which, according to Hough, would have brought inflation under control. Ryzhkov proposed price reform measures <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> several times but was turned down on each occasions, even though Gorbachev had argued strongly on the need for price reform in his speeches. Gorbachev strengthened his public image by accusing the Soviet leadership's conservative faction together with Ryzhkov, of delaying implementation of the necessary price reform. Ryzhkov had the backing of several high-standing institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee on Prices, chaired by the future Soviet Premier Valentin Pavlov. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> Ryzhkov actually had, according to Hough, a plan for a transition to a market economy. Gorbachev on the other hand was never able to turn words into deeds.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Gorbachev set 17 March as {{the date}} of the All-Union {{referendum}} that the republics would take part in to decide the fate of the Soviet Union. Offering to grant greater autonomy to the individual republics, Armenia, Georgia, along with several other republics, vowed not {{to take part in the}} referendum and instead seek independence from Moscow. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Communist Party head, Ayaz Mutalibov, continued to support Gorbachev's attempts to keep the Union together and took part in the referendum; with 92 percent of voters agreeing to remain a part of the Soviet Union. Mutalibov's staunch loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> allowed him to garner backing from Moscow and, in effect, he now had the support to discourage the aspirations of Armenians desiring to unite with Armenia or to force them to leave the region altogether.|$|E
500|$|Yanayev had {{initially}} {{been rejected by}} the Supreme Soviet, but he was finally approved due to Gorbachev's insistence, only days after Shevardnadze had resigned from office due to Gorbachev's willingness to give leeway to conservatives. Some weeks after Yanayev's election, a senior Soviet official described Yanayev as [...] "Gorbachev's Quayle—a conservative nonentity, no threat <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> and his selection would pacify the right-wing". At the beginning of January1991, Yanayev headed a committee working on {{the formation of a}} new cabinet. Later, he was sent to the Soviet city of Kuznetsk to negotiate with a newly formed independent trade union, making this the first time since 1917 that a Russian government official had negotiated with a trade union. However, after gaining the attention of the Soviet government, the unionists withdrew their plans for a strike.|$|E

5000|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> memoir, {{after the}} 27th Party Congress of December 1986, {{he met with}} Kunayev and {{discussed}} Kunayev's resignation. Kunayev expressed his desire to retire and proposed {{the appointment of a}} Russian in his place to stop advancement of Nursultan Nazarbayev (later and also the current President of Kazakhstan) in the party ranks. Kunayev, in his own book, said that Gorbachev never asked him about his replacement and only said [...] "a good comrade will be 'sent'".|$|R
500|$|Armenians in {{the region}} of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was promised to Armenia by the Bolsheviks but {{transferred}} to the Azerbaijan SSR by Stalin, began a movement to unite the area with Armenia. The majority Armenian population expressed concern about the forced [...] "Azerification" [...] of the region. On February 20, 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast voted to unify with Armenia. Demonstrations took place in Yerevan showing support for the Karabakh Armenians. [...] Azerbaijani authories encouraged counter demonstrations. However, these soon broke down into violence against Armenians in the city of Sumgait. Soon, ethnic rioting broke out between Armenians and Azeris, preventing a solid unification from taking place. A formal petition written <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and senior leaders in Moscow asked for the unification of the enclave with Armenia, but the claim was rejected in the spring of 1988. Until then, the Soviet leader had been viewed favorably by Armenians, but following his refusal to alter his stance on the issue, Gorbachev's standing among Armenians deteriorated sharply.|$|E
500|$|The {{speech was}} also a source of {{considerable}} controversy within the Reagan administration itself, with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. Robinson traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense {{that the majority of}} West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, [...] "I thought it was a good, solid draft." [...] White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded [...] "extreme" [...] and [...] "unpresidential," [...] and Deputy US National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, [...] "I think we'll leave it in." ...|$|E
500|$|Author James Mann {{disagreed}} with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, {{and those who}} praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in The New York Times, he put the speech {{in the context of}} previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> to work together to create [...] "the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down." [...] Reagan, claimed Mann, [...] "wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [...] – he was helping to set the terms {{for the end of the}} cold war." ...|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union itself {{collapsed}} between 1990 and 1991, with {{a rise of}} secessionist {{nationalism and}} a political power dispute between Gorbachev and the new non-communist leader of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. With the Soviet Union collapsing, Gorbachev prepared the country to become a loose non-communist federation of independent states called the Commonwealth of Independent States. Hard-line communist leaders in the military reacted <b>to</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> policies with the August Coup of 1991 in which hard-line communist military leaders overthrew Gorbachev and seized control of the government. This regime only lasted briefly as widespread popular opposition erupted in street protests and refused <b>to</b> submit. <b>Gorbachev</b> was restored <b>to</b> power, but the various Soviet republics were now set for independence. On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev officially announced {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, ending the existence of the world's first communist-led state.|$|R
