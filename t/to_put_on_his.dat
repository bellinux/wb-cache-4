5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
25|$|When Courtney was {{deciding}} which men <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Cornell crew, he would pick men of high moral character and strong in their studies, {{not just for}} their athletic ability. He would also try to ascertain their disposition and temperament. Courtney preferred men that were methodical and systematic. It was his view that {{if one of the}} rowers was a disturbing element he would have trouble producing a fast crew. Courtney also maintained absolute control of the crew, and would remove and substitute anyone if he believed it would help the crew succeed.|$|E
25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. He sat up, {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> life jacket {{and on the way}} back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E

25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, {{and ask him}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> toga. His wife fetches it and he puts it on. Then he is told {{that he has been}} appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of impeccable stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E
25|$|In 217, Cao Cao {{launched}} {{another attack}} on Sun Quan, {{leading to the}} Battle of Ruxu. Zhou Tai participated in the defence of Ruxu, and Sun Quan's forces succeeded in driving back the invaders. After Cao Cao's retreat, Zhou Tai was appointed General Who Pacifies the Caitiffs (平虜將軍) and was ordered to remain behind to guard Ruxu. At the time, Zhu Ran and Xu Sheng were also stationed at Ruxu and were Zhou Tai's subordinates, but they were reluctant to submit to Zhou's command. Sun Quan made a special trip to Ruxu and he threw a party for all the military officers there. Sun Quan personally served wine to Zhou Tai {{and asked him to}} undress. He pointed at every scar on Zhou Tai's body and asked Zhou about it, whereupon Zhou would relate stories of the battles he fought in. At the end, Sun Quan told Zhou Tai <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> clothes and they revelled through the night. The following day, Sun Quan instructed a herald to grant Zhou Tai his imperial parasol.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> explosives vest {{and the other to}} arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E

500|$|On 19 February, {{a funeral}} service {{was held at}} his home, {{followed}} by a military procession. [...] General Joseph E. Johnston, the Confederate officer who had commanded the resistance to Sherman's troops in Georgia and the Carolinas, served as a pallbearer in New York City. It was a bitterly cold day {{and a friend of}} Johnston, fearing that the general might become ill, asked him <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hat. Johnston famously replied: [...] "If I were in [...] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat." [...] Johnston did catch a serious cold and died one month later of pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|Corzine and {{the trooper}} were flown by {{helicopter}} to Cooper University Hospital in Camden, a Level I trauma center. The aide {{was taken by}} ambulance to Atlantic City Medical Center. Neither the NJ State Trooper nor the aide was seriously injured, but Corzine suffered broken bones, including an open fracture of the left femur, 11 broken ribs, a broken sternum, a broken collarbone, a fractured lower vertebra, and a facial cut that required plastic surgery. The Governor was not wearing a seat belt. Friends had long {{said that they had}} rarely seen him wear one. When asked why the state trooper who was driving would not have asked Corzine <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> seat belt, a staffer said the governor was [...] "not always amenable to suggestion". The Superintendent of State Police has also noted that the trooper could be charged if the crash was preventable.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours—between 2:00 am and 3:30 am—on August 28, 1955, Bryant, Milam, and Bryant's wife drove to Mose Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright {{to take them to}} [...] "the nigger who did the talking." [...] Till's {{great-aunt}} offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmet <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> clothes. Moses Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and didn't know any better. Milam reportedly then asked, [...] "How old are you preacher?" [...] to which Wright responded [...] "64." [...] Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody he wouldn't live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck and asked Carolyn Bryant whether this was the young man who had accosted her. She said that he was.|$|E

500|$|Finally in space, Homer reveals he has smuggled {{potato chips}} on board. He opens the bag, but is unaware that, {{due to the}} effects of weightlessness, they will spread around and clog the instruments. His {{appetite}} seems to save the day as he floats after the chips, eating them, but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm, letting the ants loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing [...] "You've Got a Friend", but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside, but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer bends the hatch handle, preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle's destruction on re-entry. When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration, Homer pulls a rod out of the wall to defend himself, and he inadvertently uses it to seal the door shut. With the problems solved, the shuttle successfully returns to Earth, making a convenient crash-landing through the roof of a press reporters' convention.|$|E
500|$|Wilde hesitated about {{submitting}} {{the script}} to Alexander, worrying {{that it might}} be unsuitable for the StJames's Theatre, whose typical repertoire was relatively serious, and explaining that it had been written in response to a request for a play [...] "with no real serious interest". When Henry James's Guy Domville failed, Alexander turned to Wilde and agreed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> play. Alexander began his usual meticulous preparations, interrogating the author on each line and planning stage movements with a toy theatre. In the course of these rehearsals, Alexander asked Wilde to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts. The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr. Gribsby, a solicitor who comes from London to arrest the profligate [...] "Ernest" [...] (i.e.,Jack) for his unpaid dining bills. Algernon, who is posing as [...] "Ernest", will be led away to Holloway Jail unless he settles his accounts immediately. Jack finally agrees to pay for Ernest, everyone thinking that it is Algernon's bill when in fact it is his own. The four-act version was first played on the radio in a BBC production and is still sometimes performed. Peter Raby argues that the three-act structure is more effective, and that the shorter original text is more theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition.|$|E
2500|$|Canio chases Silvio, {{but does}} not catch him and does not see his face. He demands that Nedda tell him {{the name of her}} lover, but she refuses. He threatens her with a knife, but Beppe disarms him. Beppe insists that they prepare for the performance. Tonio tells Canio that her lover will give himself away at the play. Canio is left alone <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> costume and prepares to laugh (Vesti la giubba – [...] "Put on the costume").|$|E

2500|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode was {{included}} on the season 1 DVD. As Kenny and Earl {{are about to enter}} the gay bar, a group of college students drive up to them. In response to one shouting [...] "fags" [...] out the window, Earl walks up to the college student, pulls him out of the car, punches him in the face, and tells him to learn about tolerance. Kenny stops Earl, who asks for the student's name <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> list, explaining that he must make up for his mistake.|$|E

Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr. De Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr. De Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started {{of him as a}} discus thrower. [...] Mr. De Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. [...] She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr. De Pinna leaves <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> costume.|$|E
2500|$|De Beketch was of Russian {{origin and}} from a Tatar lineage. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a colonel in the French army; his paternal grandfather was aide-de-camp to General Anton Denikin, chief of the White Armies during the Russian Civil War. De Beketch's father, a non-commissioned officer in the French foreign legion was killed in action at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, achieving Mort pour la France status. After his schooling as an enfant de troupe (military child), de Beketch performed several jobs, including manual labour and working in a bookstore. In 1966 he started doing freelance reporting for the entertainment page of the weekly newspaper Minute. In 1967, he joined the Israeli Defence Force {{at the time of}} the Six-Day War., but [...] "the fighting went so quickly that he didn't even have time <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> uniform".|$|E

2500|$|Grand Duke Vladimir {{died of an}} {{apparent}} heart attack while addressing a gathering of Spanish-speaking bankers and investors in Miami in the United States on 21 April 1992. His body was returned to Russia and he was buried with full pomp and splendour in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, the first Romanov to be honoured in this way since before the revolution. The press noted that the funeral [...] "was regarded by civic and Russian authorities as an obligation to the Romanov family rather than a step toward restoration of the monarchy." [...] According to a government spokesman, {{it was a way}} of [...] "cleansing our guilt". [...] As he was only a great-grandson of a recognized Russian emperor, his claimed title of [...] "Grand Duke of Russia" [...] caused problems as to what <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> tombstone.|$|E
2500|$|Bell's {{testimony}} {{proved to}} be a turning point. Powell was freed from his restraints, obliged <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hat and overcoat, and place his hands on Bell as if to shove him aside. Bell's reaction provoked much laughter in the courtroom, even from Powell. But Powell was rattled by the testimony, and finally agreed to speak with Doster about himself and his case. Powell expressed remorse for hurting Frederick Seward. But most of his discussion was disjointed and rambling, and he still could not remember his age or place of birth. Doster became convinced that Powell was half-witted. Although Powell revealed his real name, the name of his father, and where his parents lived, Powell's many fabrications left Doster too distrustful of these facts to act on them. (Doster did not write to George Powell in Florida until nearly a month had passed.) ...|$|E
2500|$|As a favour to {{chairman}} Martin Griffiths (who was {{in charge}} of Aymes' benefit committee in 2000), he became joint manager of football side Fleet Town in 2002–03 alongside Mark Dennis, steering them away from near-certain relegation, and winning the Russell Cotes Cup. It was even necessary for Aymes <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> boots and play in goal for Fleet. When goalkeeper Tyrone King fell awkwardly and went to hospital, Aymes played in goal for the second half. He let in two goals as Fleet lost to Sittingbourne 3–0. After Dennis left the club to become Director of Football at Eastleigh Town in June 2003, Aymes followed him out of Fleet saying it was [...] "geographically not possible" [...] to stay on in charge at Calthorpe Park for another season. On joining Havant & Waterlooville as fitness coach during the 2005–06 season he had a [...] "tremendous impact on the stamina of the players", and took on the responsibilities of the club manager the following year.|$|E
