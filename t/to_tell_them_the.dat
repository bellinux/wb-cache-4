5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin {{to believe that she}} broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Mason's {{amalgam of}} tales and {{teaching}} excursions dominates the text; although the text emphasizes the girls' moral progress, the reader learns {{very little about}} the girls themselves. The work consists largely of personal histories of people known to Mrs. Mason and of moral tales for the edification of Mary and Caroline and the reader. For example, [...] "The History of Charles Townley" [...] illustrates the fatal consequences of procrastination. Mrs. Mason takes the girls to Charles Townley's ruined mansion <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> cautionary tale of a [...] "boy of uncommon abilities, and strong feelings"; unfortunately, [...] "he ever permitted those feelings to direct his conduct, without submitting to the direction of reason; I mean, the present emotion governed him ... He always indeed intended to act right in every particular to-morrow; but to-day he followed the prevailing whim" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Charles wants to help those in need, but he is easily distracted by novels and plays. He eventually loses all of his money but his one remaining friend helps him regain his fortune in India. Yet even when this friend needs assistance, Charles cannot act quickly enough and, tragically, his friend is imprisoned and dies and his friend's daughter is forced to marry a rake. When Charles returns to England, he is overcome with guilt. He rescues the daughter from her unhappy marriage, but both she and he have gone slightly insane {{by the end of the}} story, she from her marriage and he from guilt.|$|E

500|$|The Ozians are cheering at {{the news}} that the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, is dead ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). Glinda arrives and an Ozian asks her if she and Elphaba were friends. She admits that they were, leading Glinda <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> story of how they became best friends. She also tells them her name was Galinda before she changed it. A {{flashback}} starts with a scene in a school, Shiz, where Elphaba arrives. Elphaba was the daughter of the governor of Munchkinland - but it is heavily implied that she is the product of an affair between the governor's wife and a mysterious stranger and his bottle of [...] "green elixir." [...] Elphaba was born with green skin as a result. Her father despised her and showered his affection on her younger sister, Nessarose, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair. The two sisters both go to Shiz University, where the pretty and popular Galinda is also in their class ("Dear Old Shiz"). As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of silver slippers. The headmistress, Madame Morrible, decides to take Nessarose under her protection, despite Elphaba's objections, now without a roommate and ends up with Galinda, to the disgust of both. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister as she is wheeled away, and her frustration manifests itself physically in an explosion. Madame Morrible recognizes that she has special powers and decides to teach her sorcery - and to teach no one else, even though Galinda had her heart set on studying magic at school. She even tells Elphaba that her powers might allow her to work with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, something which Elphaba has dreamed of ("The Wizard and I").|$|E

2500|$|Acts 1 {{describes}} a meal on the Mount of Olives, where Jesus commands the disciples {{to await the}} coming of the Holy Spirit, a cloud takes him upward from sight, and two men in white appear <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> (<b>the</b> disciples) that he will return [...] "in the same way you have seen him go into heaven." [...] Luke and Acts appear to describe the same event, but present quite different chronologies, Luke placing it on the same day as the Resurrection and Acts forty days afterwards; various proposals have been put forward to resolve the contradiction, but the question remains open.|$|E
2500|$|Berman {{informed}} Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga that Paramount {{had approved}} a two-picture deal around midway through The Next Generations sixth season. Moore and Braga, who were convinced Berman had called {{them into his}} office <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>The</b> Next Generation was cancelled, instead found Berman asking them to write one of the Star Trek films. Berman also worked with former Next Generation producer Maurice Hurley to develop possible story ideas. Executive producer Michael Piller turned down {{the opportunity to develop}} ideas, objecting to what he saw as a [...] "competition" [...] for the job. Ultimately Moore and Braga's script was chosen; the writers spent weeks with Berman developing the story before taking a working vacation in May 1993 to write the first-draft screenplay, completed June 1.|$|E

That night, Lionpaw can't sleep, {{thinking}} it is Foxpaw and Icepaw whispering, but then he scents WindClan outside the apprentice den. He emerges from the den, and sees all of WindClan there. He yowls and the cats rush into battle. Firestar eventually yells to stop, and the cats in both Clans obey. Firestar walks up to Onestar, who tells Firestar that WindClan is fighting because ThunderClan [...] "...will help cats once they beg for it," [...] and that they ignore the warrior code. However, WindClan leaves the camp, and Firestar tells a patrol to follow them to make sure they leave the territory.|$|E

They head 10,000 years into the past where they meet Griffon (Fumiko Orikasa/Kath Soucie) in the Moon Flower Palace, and are surprised to find he is a young moon-person. He steals both of their atlamillia and changes into his real form (Taiten Kusunoki/Mark Hamill). He reveals {{that he plans to}} call the [...] "Star of Oblivion", which will destroy all life on the planet, and allow a new, better world to grow in its place. He transports his palace into the sky of Max's time and begins destroying the world. Max and Monica use the Ixion to travel to Kazarov Stonehenge where they trigger a chrono-union to bring Paznos to Max's time. Paznos attacks the Moon Flower Palace, which crashes to the ground, and Max and Monica head to the Palace to face Griffon.|$|E
2500|$|Last Easter {{before the}} {{farewell}} party, June received {{the news from}} the Club that the long-lost twins were alive. When June could not understand the twins' letter written in Chinese, Lindo purportedly mistranslated the letter to make June believe that the twins knew about Suyuan's death and their long-lost half-sister June. Back to the present, when the farewell party ends, Lindo confesses that she wrote letters to the twins and then signed Suyuan's name. June begs Lindo <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> truth, but Lindo tells her {{that it is too}} late because the twin sisters are anticipating their mother, Suyuan, still believing that Suyuan is alive. A short while later, June's father (Chao-Li Chi) retells the war story of Suyuan and her long-lost twin daughters. Then he gives her the swan feather, which came from Suyuan's—the woman's—swan as explained earlier in the prologue, saying that the feather looks worthless but has [...] "good intentions." [...] When she arrives in China to meet her sisters, June tells them the truth about Suyuan and embraces them. In finally accepting her Chinese heritage, June is able to make peace with her deceased mother.|$|E
2500|$|From within Militant, he was {{the public}} face of a mass non-payment {{campaign}} against the Community Charge in Scotland (where it was introduced a year earlier than other parts of the UK [...] "as an experiment"). The campaign involving the refusal to pay the tax, together with resistance to warrant sales which local councils held to try to recoup the money, was ultimately successful and Sheridan became a popular political figure. Sheridan denounced those who fought the police in the large-scale riot against the poll tax in London – which took place on 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was introduced in England and Wales – and publicly threatened to [...] "name names". The police widely advertised for people <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> names of alleged rioters, and {{partly as a result of}} police acting on such information, over 100 individuals were jailed. [...] With Joan McAlpine, he published A Time to Rage which chronicled the anti-poll tax movement of the late-1980s and early-1990s. McAlpine has since written about the Sheridan she became close to during that turbulent youthful period, with reference in particular to the libel case.|$|E

2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required {{that he be}} a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs {{to be close to}} those who needed to hear what he wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in the recesses of the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E
