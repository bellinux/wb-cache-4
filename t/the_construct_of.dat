25|$|David Spiegel {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{suggestion}} of relabeling some forms of sexual encounters between adults and children/adolescents as adult-child (or adult-adolescent) sex is fundamentally flawed, because children cannot give meaningful consent to sexual relations with an adult. Some critics {{also argued that}} using value-neutral terminology would normalize CSA and that redefining terminology {{is not in the}} interest of the general public because it confuses the underlying moral issues. Rind et al. replied that <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> consent used in their study was misinterpreted by critics; they only asserted that children/adolescents are capable of simple consent (willingness) as opposed to informed consent used in legal contexts, and used this as a variable in their study simply because it was used in the original studies - where it had predictive validity. Thus, they conclude that although <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically valid term. A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich, who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.|$|E

The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder respectively, stating that these diagnoses have {{been referred to}} (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy.

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that some modern historians call into {{question}} the identification of the Erik who ruled over Jorvik with Erik Bloodaxe. None of the English sources for Erik's reign in Northumbria identify him as Norwegian or as the son of Harald Fairhair. A thirteenth-century letter from Edward I to Pope Boniface VIII identifies Erik as Scottish in origin. Lappenberg, Plummer and Todd, writing in the late nineteenth century, identified Erik as a son of Harald Bluetooth, a claim Downham discounts as untenable. Downham, however, regards Erik the king of Jorvik as a distinct individual from Erik Bloodaxe, and thus views Gunnhild's sojourn in Orkney and Jorvik as <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> later saga-writers who conflated different characters between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.|$|E
25|$|Some clinicians {{suggest that}} {{assessment}} of <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy {{does not necessarily}} add value to violence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R {{and some of these}} are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it.|$|E
25|$|A provincial {{government}} {{is defined by}} the Constitution Act, 1867, as the lieutenant governor acting on the advice of the executive council, what is technically known as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, referring to the lieutenant governor as the Queen's stand-in. One of the main duties of the Crown in a province is to appoint the individual most likely to maintain the confidence of the legislative assembly as prime minister (known in the provinces as premier); this is usually the leader of the political party with a majority in the legislature, but when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority parliament), or similar scenario, the lieutenant governor's judgement about the most suitable candidate for premier must be brought into play. The premier thereafter heads the executive council, which is made up of other ministers of the Crown who are similarly drawn from and responsible to the elected legislature and are charged with advising the lieutenant governor on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to maintain the Queen's peace, grant immunity from prosecution, and invoke the prerogative of mercy, as well as to summon and prorogue parliament and call elections. In <b>the</b> <b>construct</b> <b>of</b> constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding; the monarch reigns but does not rule. However, {{it is important to note}} that, though it may often appear differently, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers, and the viceroyal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Graziano and Kastner {{proposed}} the [...] "attention schema" [...] theory of awareness.

The same cortical machinery {{is also used to}} attribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect. In the attention schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.|$|E
