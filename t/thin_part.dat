5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very <b>thin</b> <b>part</b> (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E

60|$|Dominick did not condescend {{to answer}} this remark, but, taking one of the bamboos, stood it up close to the tree, not touching, but {{a few inches from}} the trunk, and bound it firmly with the cord to the three pegs. Thus he had the first three rounds or rungs of an upright ladder, one side of which was the tree, the other the bamboo. Mounting the second of these rungs he drove in a fourth peg, and {{fastened}} the bamboo to it in the same way, and then, taking another step, he fixed a fifth peg. Thus, step by step, he mounted till he had reached between fifteen and twenty feet from the ground, where the upright bamboo becoming too slender, another was called for and handed up by Otto. This was lashed to the first bamboo, as well as to three of the highest pegs, and the operation was continued.

50|$|The sawing-off of Manhattan Island {{is an old}} New York City {{story that}} is largely unverified.

It was believed that by cutting the island, towing it out, rotating it 180 degrees, and putting it back in place that Manhattan would be stabilized, and that the <b>thin</b> <b>part</b> of the island could be condemned. Surprisingly, the main concern was not the futility of the idea but of Long Island's being in the way. Lozier finally assembled a large workforce and logistical support.

5000|$|However kūnbù in Chinese and konbu in Japanese {{are false}} friends. A first {{possibility}} {{to explain the}} association arises because descriptions of kūnbù in Chinese documents are vague and inconsistent, and {{it is impossible to}} identify to which seaweed the term might have applied.

The difficulty is that, at least in that time, kombu was not produced either in the East nor in the South China Sea.
