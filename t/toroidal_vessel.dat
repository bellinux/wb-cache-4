40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues for the design of filament-wound pressure vessels reflects on the determination {{of the most}} efficient meridian profiles and related fiber architectures, leading to optimal structural performance. To better understand the design and optimization of filament-wound pressure vessels, in this dissertation we present an overview and comprehensive treatment for toroidal and domed pressure vessels. Since the geodesic winding has severe boundary conditions that confine the layup optimization, the non-geodesic trajectories are here extensively applied to enlarge the design space. Designing optimal laminate layup is not the only issue; the fibers must be stable on the mandrel and be exactly placed along trajectories as predetermined by structural design. To obtain a stable fiber trajectory, the stability-ensuring conditions are formulated in terms of both fiber slippage and bridging tendencies; these conditions provide the basic criteria for the subsequent design of various pressure vessels. The mathematical description of the geodesics and non-geodesics on a generic shell of revolution is briefly presented. A generalized optimality criterion that is adapted to various optimal design problems for pressure vessels is elaborated. This condition originates from the idea that the optimal pressure vessels are governed by the condition of equal shell strains, or equivalently, zero shear stress at lamina level. The specific equations and the feasible intervals of the optimality condition are also given for several types of laminations. The basic equations of the netting analysis and their applications to the design of circular <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels</b> are here outlined. The influence of the fiber layup and the geometry of the toroid on the stability of netting-dictated fiber trajectories are evaluated. A new possibility to improve the vessel performance can be offered by the application of adapted cross-sectional shapes instead of the conventional shapes. The isotensoid design, which leads to equal fiber tension throughout the whole structure, is conducted to determine the netting-based optimal cross-sectional shapes. The governing equations for determining geodesic and non-geodesic isotensoids are respectively derived and their feasible intervals are also determined. In addition, a simplified method for designing isotensoid pressure vessels with unequal polar opening is also outlined, with the aid of non-geodesic trajectories. The optimal design, based on orthotropic plate theory, is divided into two basic approaches: numerical and semi-analytical methods. A numerical optimization method is specially designed for determining the optimal meridian profiles of bellow-shaped pressure vessels. An integral design method is proposed for circular <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels,</b> with emphasis on the determination of the optimal non-geodesic trajectories and winding patterns. Based on the previously-obtained (generalized) optimality condition, semi-analytical design methods are presented for the determination of the optimal meridian profiles for continuum-based domes and toroids, respectively. The optimal cross sectional shapes lead to significantly improved vessel performance. An extensive study of the manufacturing of filament wound <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels</b> is conducted. We here emphasize the importance of suitable winding patterns for obtaining an optimal pressure vessel, and we accordingly derived the "Diophantine"-alike pattern equations that produced such patterns. The main objective of the method presented here is to match the structure-dictated number of wound circuits to the solution of the pattern equations for determining the proper winding velocities of the mandrel and the feed eye. In addition, depending on the aimed lathe machine configuration, the underlying geometric model of the new-fashioned toroidal winder is outlined and the kinematic solutions for coupling the motion of the mandrel and the feed eye are also given. Simulations of geodesic and non-geodesic trajectories are performed for winding <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels.</b> Last but not least, since ultra-high pressure vessels require thick-walled designs, this dissertation is also extended to three-dimensional problems where the through-thickness stress gradient is taken into account. A three-dimensional (3 D) elasticity analysis on multi-layered thick-walled pressure vessels is here addressed. In order to better understand the design approaches of thick-walled composite cylinders and find ways to improve their structural performance, a review is devoted to 3 D elasticity approaches for obtaining the exact solutions of the stresses and strains induced by internal pressure, and the effects of hygrothermal loading and twisting. The 3 D effective elastic constants and most frequently used failure criteria for cylindrically anisotropic materials are also presented.

5000|$|One {{attempt to}} improve the reactor {{geometry}} was attempted by a class of designs known as the [...] "compact tokamak", typified by the Alcator C-Mod (operational since 1991), the Riggatron (conceptual, unbuilt) and IGNITOR (construction in progress as of 2016-02). The later two of these designs dispensed with the first wall and placed the magnets {{in direct contact with}} the plasma; in a production design the blanket would be outside the magnets. This greatly simplifies the physical design as well, as the <b>toroidal</b> vacuum <b>vessel</b> can be replaced with a cylinder. The decreased distance between the magnets and plasma leads to much higher betas, so conventional (non-superconducting) magnets could be used.The downside to this approach, one that was widely criticized in the field, is that it places the magnets directly in the high-energy neutron flux of the fusion reactions. In operation the magnets would be rapidly eroded, requiring the vacuum vessel to be opened and the entire magnet assembly replaced after a month or so of operation.|$|R

In trapped Bose-Einstein condensates, the topology of the trap can be characterized by the topology of the Thomas-Fermi surface of its N-particle ground state. This can be altered during an experiment, so that a toroidal trap may deform into a more spherical shape, allowing an initially persistent current to decay into singly-quantized vortices. We investigate such a procedure numerically, and confirm that the Thomas-Fermi prescription for the trap topology gives an accurate picture of vortex formation. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

The problem of equilibrium is formulated in terms of solutions of a 2 D partial difference equation. This equation is solved in the large-aspect-ratio limit and a general expression for the shift of the potential axis is obtained which shows that the shift is approximately epsilon and that it depends solely on the internal capacitance of the cloud. The simulation study is based upon the modified MHD equations and the nonlocal nature of the mode is investigated.

The overall mechanical design of ISX is predicated {{on the ability to}} remove the upper segment of the toroidal field coils to allow access to the <b>toroidal</b> vacuum <b>vessel.</b> The high current, 120 kA, capability of the new 74 MW power supply, coupled with the modest field requirement of ISX, allows the use of room temperature copper coils. Seventy-two turns, grouped into 18 coils, generate a magnet field of 18 kG at the major radius of 90 cm. Finite element structural analysis codes were utilized to determine the distribution of stresses and deflections around a typical turn. Initial material distribution on a coil was sized using the two-dimensional program FEATS. The resulting coil design was then coupled to the center bucking and out-of-plane restraint systems utilizing the NASTRAN code. The boundary conditions for the analytical models used in the two programs were then iterated, reaching satisfactory agreement as to stress contours and location for the joints. (auth...|$|R

This dust, originating from the erosion of tungsten and beryllium internal walls of the torus by the plasma, would be mobilized to some extent during a loss of vacuum accident (LOVA). For safety reasons, {{it is essential to}} quantify the re-suspended dust fraction during such an event. Here, we provide preliminary experimental data of dust re-suspension obtained in the wind tunnel of the European Space Agency (ESA) at low pressures (300, 130 and 10 mbar). The experimentations were performed with multilayer deposits. We used two powders with a median diameter at 15. 5 μm and 21. 8 μm. A negative influence of the low pressure in the re-suspension mechanism is observed. For example, given a re-suspension fraction of 10 %, increasing friction shear velocities are derived for decreasing absolute pressures: 300 mbar/ 0. 66 m s− 1; 130 mbar/ 1. 08 m s− 1; and 10 mbar/ 1. 84 m s− 1.

Inside the <b>toroidal</b> <b>vessel,</b> plasma with temperature in excess of 100 million degrees Celsius is generated and constrained by high power magnetic fields. Additional protection is provided by tiles which clad the inside of the machine. As part of a major upgrade existing heat protective tiles are to be replaced with an advanced design, and renewed interest has been shown in dimensional measurement of the surface. Measurement must occur during shutdown periods where temperature and pressure are at ambient levels. Manned entry is not permissible and all work should be performed remotely. To avoid contamination which could affect the fusion reaction and experimental results, contact with the measurement surface is not permitted. This work assesses non-contact surface measurement technologies, along with standards and guidelines for dimensional surface measurement. Existing measurement test artefacts do not offer the required surface finish and features, so specific test artefacts have been designed and produced. These artefacts are traceable to the national length standard, as traceability is a pre-requisite to evaluate accuracy. Exploratory tests highlighted two technologies for further investigation, laser triangulation and white light fringe projection. Two commercially available, state-ofthe- art examples of each technology have been evaluated using a processing method developed to highlight performance in key areas relevant to EFDA-JET. These areas include quantitative assessments of the effect of surface angle on measurement quality, the effect of depth of field for fringe projection systems and the ability of technologies to record gap and flush from tens of micrometres to millimetres.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} on spheromaks injected into the empty vacuum vessel of the Caltech ENCORE tokamak (i. e., without tokamak plasma) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 2144 (1990); Phys. Fluids B 2, 1306 (1990) ]. Magnetic probe arrays (in a number of configurations) {{have been used to}} make single shot, unaveraged, in situ measurements of the spheromak equilibrium. These measurements are important because (i) they reveal {{for the first time the}} equilibrium structure of spheromaks in a toroidal geometry, (ii) they provide a reliable estimate of magnetic helicity and energy of spheromak plasmas used in injection experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 2144 (1990) ], and (iii) they constitute the first measurements of spheromak motion across and interaction with static magnetic fields (which are useful in corroborating recent theories). Probe measurements in the tokamak dc toroidal field show for the first time that the spheromak exhibits a ``double tilt. ''The spheromak first tilts while in the cylindrical entrance region, emerging into the tokamak vessel antialigned to the dc toroidal field, then expands into the tokamak vacuum vessel, and finally tilts again to form an oblate (nonaxisymmetric, m= 1) configuration. In addition, the spheromak drifts vertically in the direction given by Jcenter×Btok, where Jcenter is the unbalanced poloidal current that threads the center of the spheromak torus. Probe arrays at different toroidal locations show that the spheromak shifts toroidally (horizontally left or right) in the direction opposite that of the static toroidal field. In the absence of toroidal flux, the m= 1 object develops a helical pitch, the sense of the pitch depending on the sign of the spheromak helicity. The spheromak equilibrium in the <b>toroidal</b> <b>vessel</b> is well fit by a pressureless infinite cylindrical model; however, there is evidence of deviation from m= 1 symmetry because of toroidal effects, nonuniform J/B profile, and finite beta. Experiments performed in a test facility consisting of the spheromak gun and a replica of the entrance region (with a closed end) show that the spheromak is generated with its axis coaxial with that of the gun. Coherent, m= 2 magnetic modes are observed during the formation stage rotating in the E×B direction at about 125 kHz (rotation velocity corresponding to 40 % of the Alfvén speed) ...|$|E

First, current drive by spheromak injection into the ENCORE tokamak {{as a result of}} the process of magnetic helicity injection is observed. An initial 30 % increase in plasma current is observed followed by a drop by a factor of 3 because of sudden plasma cooling. Second, spheromak injection results in an increase of tokamak central density by a factor of 6. The high-current/high-density discharge is terminated by a sharp peaking of the density profile followed by an interchange instability. In a second experiment, the spheromak is injected into the magnetized <b>toroidal</b> vacuum <b>vessel</b> (with no tokamak plasma) fitted with magnetic probe arrays. An m= 1 (nonaxisymmetric) magnetic structure forms in the vessel after the spheromak undergoes a double tilt; once in the cylindrical entrance between gun and tokamak, then again in the tokamak vessel. In the absence of net toroidal flux, the structure develops a helical pitch (the sense of pitch depends on the helicity sign). Experiments with a number of refractory metal electrode coatings have shown that tungsten and chrome coatings provide some improvement in spheromak parameters. Design details of a larger, higher-current spheromak gun with a new accelerator section are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: In this {{research}} an analysis technique is developed to model orthotropic composite toroids and optimize the fiber layup, {{accounting for the}} natural variation in thickness due to fiber stacking. The behavior of toroids is difficult to model using membrane shell theories due to a singularity in the strain-displacement relations occurring at the toroid crest that yields discontinuous displacement results. Method of Approach: A technique is developed here where the constitutive properties of multi-layered toroidal shells are determined using lamination theory and the toroid strains and line loads are determined using finite element analysis. The toroid strains are rotated into the fiber directions, allowing the fiber stress and transverse stress distributions to be determined for each layer. The fiber layup is modified heuristically until an optimum is found. An optimum is reached when the maximum fiber and transverse direction stresses of each shell layer are equal, minimizing wasted fibers and excess weight. Results: Test cases are analyzed to verify {{the accuracy of the}} finite element model and an example composite toroid with Kevlar/epoxy material properties is optimized. Conclusions: The analysis technique developed here can decrease the time and cost associated with the development of orthotropic <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels,</b> resulting in lighter, cheaper and more optimal structures.

40|$|Interplay of {{transition}} of floating potential fluctuations in a glow discharge plasma in the <b>toroidal</b> vacuum <b>vessel</b> of SINP tokamak has been observed. With {{variation in the}} strength of the vertical and toroidal magnetic fields, regular and inverted relaxation oscillations as well as sinusoidal oscillations are observed with the slow and fast time scale of the relaxation oscillations reversing their nature at a high value of vertical magnetic field strength. However for small value of toroidal magnetic field the transitions follow relaxation → chaotic oscillations with the chaotic nature prevailing at higher values of toroidal magnetic field. Evolution of associated anode fireball dynamics under the action of increasing vertical, toroidal as well as increasing vertical field at a fixed toroidal field (mixed field) of different strength has been studied. Estimation of phase coherence index for each case has been carried out to examine the evidence of finite nonlinear interaction. A comprehensive study of the dynamics of the fireball is found {{to be associated with the}} values of phase coherence index.

Currently, there exist many gaps in toroidal CPV research which must be addressed to fully realise the potential of this technology.

An original analysis of toroidal radius ratio (R/r) influence on the thickness profiles of naturally-thickened and isotensoid circular toroidal CPVs is conducted. It is concluded that a focus on smaller radius ratios (1. 25 &lt; R/r &lt; 3) is required to maximise the potential space-saving and volumetric efficiencies of the torus.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} we {{have presented}} an overview and comprehensive treatment of several {{facets of the}} filament winding process. With the concepts of differential geometry and the theory of thin anisotropic shells of revolution, a parametric shape generator has been formulated for the design procedure of optimal composite pressure vessels in particular. The mathematical description of both geodesic and non-geodesic roving trajectories has been presented, including {{a proposal for a}} mandrel shape that facilitates the experimental procedure for the determination of the coefficient of friction. In addition, an overview of several (non-) geodesic trajectories is here given. Furthermore, an algorithm for the automatic generation of suitable winding patterns has been outlined, in combination with several pattern optimisation strategies. An extensive treatment of the kinematics of filament winding is here presented, in combination with several recommendations for a proper derivation of the associated velocities and accelerations to which the moving machine parts and the roving itself are subjected. A simplified collision control module has resulted in the determination of the limits where the feed eye is allowed to move in. Within this space and with the dynamic machine limits, an optimisation problem has been set up, serving the aim of production time minimisation. This has been achieved by application of dynamic programming that minimises a summation of constraint respecting time increments, after the realisation of a grid-reduction with a technique that is based on elementary sparse matrix multiplication. Furthermore, several novel machine configurations have been proposed, which are dedicated to pressure vessels with various aspect ratios, shape morphology and types of applied wound circuits. With the shell equilibrium equations as a basis, we have derived the class of articulated pressurisable structures, comprising isotensoids that are axially stacked on each other. Moreover, the non-geodesically overwound isotensoid has been introduced, together with a variant being additionally subjected to external radial forces. The same equilibrium equations have generated shapes like the geodesically overwound hyperboloid and optimal <b>toroidal</b> pressure <b>vessels.</b> Furthermore, we have proposed several application fields for these items. As a leitmotiv throughout the thesis, the derived methodologies and equations have been applied on the class of isotensoid pressure vessels.

40|$|The large {{vacuum vessel}} of the J. E. T. (Joint European Torus) {{experiment}} {{has been designed}} as an all metal composite torus of non-circular cross-section. To comply with mechanical stability and ultra high vacuum requirements it has been designed as a completely welded fabrication. The metal structure consists of 32 rigid and wedge-shaped sections (equal in number to the B TOR field coils) which in turn are joined together by parallel bellows to form a torus. The rigid sectors are of box type construction suitably ribbed to withstand the stresses imposed upon them by the external forces. The bellows linking these rigid sectors determine the electrical resistance of the metallic vacuum vessel the long way around the torus, since currents which are induced in parallel with the plasma current should be kept as low as possible. All forces acting on the vacuum vessel are absorbed by the rigid sectors which also incorporate the openings to {{the interior of the}} machine, such as ports for pumping, diagnostics, auxiliary plasma heating, etc [...] . This <b>toroidal</b> vacuum <b>vessel</b> has been designed as a double walled structure with the bellows linking the rigid sectors being fitted as pairs, and it is proposed to circulate hot inert gas through out this interspace in order to raise the temperature of the whole vacuum vessel to 500 °C to achieve bakeout conditions which will assist in reaching the required base pressure of 10 - 10 torr. In order to protect external apparatus from this bakeout temperature the outside of the vacuum vessel will be thermally insulated. Much consideration has been given to the choice of materials from which to construct this vacuum vessel. Stress conditions at elevated temperatures and electrical requirements indicate {{that one of the most}} suitable materials would be in the high content nickel alloy range. The final choice was to use Inconel 600 (a trade name of Huntington Alloys, USA) or Nicrofer 7216 (a trade name of Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke FRG) for the rigid sectors and Inconel 625 (Nicrofer 6020) for the bellows, the latter material having the required electrical resistivity. The horizontal ports lying on the equitorial plane are connected to pumping boxes which in turn form locations for the turbo molecular and cryopumps. They also provide maximum access to the interior of the vacuum vessel for the beams of energetic neutral particles proposed for additional plasma heating. The vacuum vessel has been so designed that all the stresses are taken by the rigid sectors, whilst the radial inward directed forces are transmitted to and supported by a modular restraint ring which acts as an arch type of structure transmitting pressure forces of 100 tons between adjacent rigid sectors. The forces acting on the vacuum vessel are due to the atmospheric pressure during normal operation and during bakeout operations at 500 °C, the electro magnetic forces due to eddy currents which are induced in the metallic structure when the magnetic fluxes linking the vacuum vessel change with time, and the thermal stresses arising for expansion of the vacuum vessel during the baking and during experimental operation...|$|R
