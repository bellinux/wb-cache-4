5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade {{would have to be}} evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> interior.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 18 November, the Austro-Hungarians moved into {{position}} {{to carry out a}} further assault, which began the following morning. The Austro-Hungarians' main goal was to break through the defenses of <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> 2nd Army, concentrated primarily around Lazarevac, and to drive <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> 1st Army back towards the town of Gornji Milanovac while simultaneously assaulting Serbian positions around the villages of Čovka and Vrače Brdo which threatened the Austro-Hungarian flank. The Austro-Hungarians gained a foothold at Vrače Brdo by the evening of 19 November, and seized higher ground from the Serbs further to the south. <b>The</b> <b>Serbian</b> 1st Army was forced to retreat the following day, giving the Austro-Hungarians the ability to advance down the main routes leading to Kragujevac. Potiorek believed it was possible that Putnik was trying to lure the Austro-Hungarians deeper into Serbia for the purpose of encircling them and then attacking their flanks, but correctly assessed that <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Army was in no position to carry out such an attack.|$|E
5|$|In addition, White Eagles paramilitaries {{arrived in}} Borovo Selo in mid-April {{at the request}} of Borovo Selo militia {{commander}} Vukašin Šoškoćanin. The paramilitaries were armed by <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> police directly, or the SAO Krajina-aligned local militia under the approval of Serbian officials. By the end of April 1991, the White Eagles in Borovo Selo were joined by Dušan Silni paramilitaries, who were linked to <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> National Renewal party.|$|E
5|$|Serbia was {{defeated}} during the autumn 1915 phase of <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Campaign, prompting France and Britain to transfer {{troops from the}} Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia.

5|$|The {{raising of}} <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Patriarchate {{resulted}} in bishops becoming metropolitans. <b>The</b> <b>Serbian</b> ruler had wide autocratic powers, but was surrounded and advised by a permanent council of magnates (velikaši or velmože) and prelates.

50|$|The {{objectives}} of the Bulgarian Second Army were to cut the communication and supply lines between Macedonia and Serbia, to prevent a retreat of <b>the</b> main <b>Serbian</b> forces to Macedonia and to repel any Entente attempts to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>Serbians</b> from <b>the</b> south.|$|R

5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but he noticed that <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command the forces of <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> puppet government, known as <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but {{little is known about}} its activities.|$|E

5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned much in Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation and that of his successors suggest that he was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia is also evident from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, asking him to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between the then-Kingdom of Serbia and the United States were established in the 19th century. In 1879, <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Consulate-General in New York was opened. On February 3, 1882, <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Parliament adopted a contract and Convention of diplomatic {{relations between}} the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States, given by King Milan Obrenović. The United States Senate adopted both documents on July 5, 1882 without debate or amendments. On November 10, 1882, Eugene Schuyler became the first United States ambassador in Serbia.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November <b>the</b> <b>Serbians</b> {{concentrated}} {{two divisions}} {{for an attack}} on the Bulgarian left near Karnul (today Delyan, Sofia Province) in an attempt to join up with the Morava division. However, three battalions of Bulgarian troops led by Captain Popov from Sofia had held the Morava division in the Visker Hills and the flanking move failed. Alexander now ordered a counterattack which pushed <b>the</b> <b>Serbians</b> back on both flanks although nightfall prevented a complete collapse.|$|R
50|$|The {{slaughter}} of the dukes triggered <b>the</b> First <b>Serbian</b> Uprising. Karadjordje was elected as leader.

50|$|The {{battle of}} Zvečan was an 11th-century {{conflict}} over land and power between the ruling Byzantine Empire and <b>the</b> <b>Serbians.</b> <b>The</b> borderland town of Zvečan became a central focus for skirmishes, pillow fights, raids, and the eventual decimation and {{defeat of the}} Byzantine Empire in Serbia.|$|R
5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their goal was to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. <b>The</b> <b>Serbian</b> annexation led to the exodus of many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> authorities.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after that}} campaign, Simeon sought to punish <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign the Appeal to <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes that many of those who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon <b>the</b> <b>Serbian</b> population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist rebels, and called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. <b>The</b> <b>Serbian</b> Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties for the killing of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> First <b>Serbian</b> Uprising {{took place}} in 1804, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> Second <b>Serbian</b> Uprising in 1815; Serbia was fully liberated by 1867. Officially recognized independence followed in 1878.|$|R
