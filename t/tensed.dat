First, what is a <b>tense?</b> Second, what do <b>tenses</b> mean? Third, how are <b>tenses</b> formed {{and how do they}} relate to each other? First, a <b>tense</b> is a necessary component of nearly every English sentence or question. It exists whenever an utterance contains a subject-verb combination. It communicates something about the time of the action or state of being of the sentence. It is composed of a primary or main verb, usually accompanied by one or more helping verbs. When an action or state of being word, i. e. a verb, is used outside of a subject-verb combination, that verb does not have <b>tense.</b> Chart # 1 presents examples of the 12 English <b>tenses.</b> Chart # 1 – Examples of 12 English <b>Tenses</b> Simple <b>Tenses</b> (simple) Continuing <b>Tenses</b> (progressive) Before <b>Tenses</b> (perfect) Continuing Before <b>Tenses</b> (perfect progressive) Future <b>Tenses</b> I will walk home. I will be walking home. I will have walked home I will have been walking home Present <b>Tenses</b> I walk home I am walking home. I have walked home I have been walking home Past <b>Tenses</b> I walked home I was walking home I had walked home I had been walking home The names of the <b>tenses</b> refer to their meanings by combining the time of the <b>tense</b> (the row) with the kind of <b>tense</b> (the column) : e. g. Simple-Future <b>Tense,</b> Present-Continuing <b>Tense,</b> Past-Before <b>Tense.</b> (Traditional <b>tense</b> names are in parentheses.) Second, English <b>tenses</b> convey 3 kinds of meanings: when an action occurred, whether the action continues over a period of time, and whether it happens before a particular time. These time concepts in various combinations reflect the meanings of all 12 English <b>tenses.</b> These meanings are presented in Chart # 2. This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Chart # 2 – The Meanings of English <b>Tenses</b> Simple <b>Tenses</b> Continuing <b>Tenses</b> Before <b>Tenses</b> Continuing Before <b>Tenses</b> Future <b>Tenses</b> occurring at a future time continuing at a future time occurring before a future time occurring and continuing before a future time Present <b>Tenses</b> occurring at a regular time continuing now occurring before now occurring and continuing before now Past <b>Tenses</b> occurring at a past time continuing at a past time occurring before a past time occurring and continuing before a past time Third, English <b>tenses</b> are formed utilizing various Verb Forms and Helping Verbs. They relate to each other in various ways. This is illustrated in Chart # 3.

This makes the writer assume {{that there are many}} students, even at the English department, who still cannot use “Tense” in the correct way related to functions. Therefore, the writer is interested in analyzing the errors of using <b>tense</b> in English. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out the type of errors that the students made in constructing English sentences using Simple Present <b>Tense,</b> Present Continuous <b>Tense,</b> Simple Past <b>Tense,</b> Past Continuous <b>Tense,</b> Future <b>Tense,</b> Future Continuous <b>Tense,</b> Present Perfect <b>Tense,</b> and Present Perfect Continuous <b>Tense</b> and the percentage of students who know the form but not the function, know the function but not the form, know both the form and the function, and know neither the function nor the form, the writer conducted the study under report at the fourth – semester students’ structure III of the English Department of Widya Mandala Catholic University Surabaya, academic 2008 - 2009 being the subject of the study.

25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly <b>tensed</b> muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly <b>tensed</b> as when yawning deeply.|$|E
25|$|Languages that do {{not have}} {{grammatical}} tense, such as Chinese, express time reference chiefly by lexical means – through adverbials, time phrases, and so on. (The same is done in <b>tensed</b> languages, to supplement or reinforce the time information conveyed by the choice of tense.) Time information is also sometimes conveyed as a secondary feature by markers of other categories, as with the Chinese aspect markers le and guo, which in most cases place an action in past time. However, much time information is conveyed implicitly by context – it is therefore not always necessary, when translating from a <b>tensed</b> to a tenseless language, say, to express explicitly in the target language all of the information conveyed by the tenses in the source.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of one of}} the subordinator suffixes {{constitutes}} the main subordination strategy. Since these suffixes occupy the same place as the tense suffixes, the resulting subordinate clauses are tenseless, in this respect resembling non-finite clauses in European languages. Nonetheless, Rama verb forms with subordinators take subject prefixes under the same basic conditions as <b>tensed</b> ones, and in this way resemble finite forms.|$|E

25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know <b>tensed</b> facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E
25|$|In the {{circumflex}} {{cases the}} second element is emphasized and lengthened. But for the mixed diphthongs, the circumflex variant {{can also be}} pronounced without an emphasis and be understood only as shortness of a first element of a diphthong (in contrast to the acute, where the first element lengthens) in a standard language. In some cases, like in a word oppositional to várna 'crow': var̃nas 'raven', the r would occur more likely emphasized, than not. But in some, for example, var̃das 'name', it can occur either emphasized, or not (so {{that it would be}} understood by some as vàrdas in the latter case). Such pronunciation and understanding of a circumflex diphthong being more some like without emphasis of any of its two elements, but some like a shortness of a first element, could also fit for aũ, aĩ, eĩ diphthongs, but an emphasis of the second element (similarly to the acute case, where the first element is emphasized) is characteristic for them too. The first element of circumflex cases is similar to a short unstressed vowel – not <b>tensed,</b> more closed. In an aũ case a vowel a receives a slight o shade (becomes narrower).|$|E

The active, passive, and the semi-participles are inflected by gender, and the active, passive, and necessity ones are inflected by case.|$|R
25|$|Although not {{mentioned}} by either of his earliest biographers, Baldinucci or Domenico Bernini, the Elephant and Obelisk is a sculpture {{located near the}} Pantheon, in the Piazza della Minerva, {{in front of the}} Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope Alexander VII decided that he wanted a small ancient Egyptian obelisk (that was discovered beneath the piazza) to be erected on the same site, and in 1665 he commissioned Bernini to create a sculpture to support the obelisk. The sculpture of an elephant bearing the obelisk on its back was executed by one of Bernini's students, Ercole Ferrata, upon a design by his master, and finished in 1667. An inscription on the base relates the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddess Minerva to the Virgin Mary, who supposedly supplanted those pagan goddesses and to whom the church is dedicated. A popular anecdote concerns the elephant's smile. To find out why it is smiling, legend has it, the viewer must examine the rear end of the animal and notice that its muscles are <b>tensed</b> and its tail is shifted to the left as if it were defecating. The animal's rear is pointed directly at one of the headquarters of the Dominican Order, housing the offices of its Inquisitors as well as the office of Father Giuseppe Paglia, a Dominican friar {{who was one of the}} main antagonists of Bernini, as a final salute and last word.|$|E

The situation <b>tensed</b> when the hijacked Lufthansa aircraft came dangerously close to the point of fuel starvation. In what he later called a [...] "state of emergency" [...] due to an alleged loss of communications with Munich, Lufthansa chairman Culmann personally ordered the pilot of the aircraft carrying the released Munich attackers to head towards and land at Zagreb Airport, thus acting against orders by higher authorities. As a consequence, a legal investigation against Culmann was initiated, but abandoned shortly thereafter.|$|E

Verlaine held his right hand across his body and extended his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members to mull over.
