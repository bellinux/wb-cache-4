25|$|In his {{analysis}} of medieval political theology, The King’s Two Bodies, Ernst Kantorowicz describes medieval kings as containing two bodies: a body natural, and a body politic. The theme of the king's two bodies is pertinent throughout Richard II, from the exile of Bolingbroke to the deposition of King Richard II. The body natural is a mortal body, subject to all the weaknesses of mortal human beings. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> is a spiritual body which cannot be affected by mortal infirmities such as disease and old age. These two bodies form one indivisible unit, with <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> superior to the body natural.|$|E

Challenged by this call of arms, Godoy and his royal patrons found that they had few defenders.

As for Fernando, he was seen as a saviour, the reception that he received when he rode into Madrid on 24 March.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{connection}} to this general geographic region, {{it is difficult to}} determine from the Torah the exact boundaries of the tribe, to the extent that it is even uncertain whether Asher even had continuous territory. Sites which according to the Bible were allocated to Asher, and whose locations have since been identified, appear to be a scattered distribution of settlements rather than a compact and well-defined tribal region. Despite appearing to have had good contact with the markets of Phoenicia, Asher appears, throughout its history, to have been fairly disconnected from the other tribes of Israel; additionally it seems to have taken little part in the antagonism portrayed in the Torah between the Canaanites and the other tribes, for example in the war involving Barak and Sisera. Critical scholars generally conclude that Asher consisted of certain clans that were affiliated with portions of the Israelite tribal confederation, but were never incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b>|$|E

500|$|Thomas Cromwell (c. 1485–1540) {{also came}} to define Henry's government. Returning to England from the {{continent}} in 1514 or 1515, Cromwell soon entered Wolsey's service. He turned to law, also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1524. He became Wolsey's [...] "man of all work". Cromwell, driven in part by his religious beliefs, attempted to reform <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> of the English government through discussion and consent, and through the vehicle of continuity and not outward change. He was seen by many people as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims, including Thomas Audley. By 1531, Cromwell and those associated with him were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation. Cromwell's first office {{was that of the}} master of the King's jewels in 1532, from which he began to invigorate the government finances. By this point, Cromwell's power as an efficient administrator in a Council full of politicians exceeded what Wolsey had achieved.|$|E
500|$|Gay {{publications}} in which The Homosexual Matrix received reviews included The Advocate, {{where it was}} discussed by the novelist George Whitmore, and <b>The</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Politic,</b> where it was criticized by Michael Lynch, who wrote that while initially delighted by the work, he later concluded {{that it is a}} [...] "deceptive book inadequate to its task" [...] that the gay movement should not endorse. In his view, Tripp made many claims without empirical evidence and neglected lesbianism and female sexuality in general. Lynch argued that Tripp's understanding of sexual relations between men and women, and his account of how tension between the sexes creates erotic excitement, were influenced by biological determinism. Lynch found Tripp's discussion of why societies have increased divisions between the sexes interesting, but also poorly worked out. Lynch accepted Tripp's view that sexual orientation depends on learning, but disagreed with the details of his account, and argued that Tripp's theories are [...] "linked to psychoanalytic assumptions." [...] Lynch accused Tripp of seeking to legitimize homosexuality [...] "by making it bland", criticized Whitmore for defending him, and expressed partial agreement with Hendin's review.|$|E

[...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame.

500|$|Once Lowe {{joined the}} {{permanent}} cast, Chris' role changed into {{more of an}} authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency, although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality. Schur said of this second role: [...] "He doesn’t like frayed ends or controversies [...] he wants <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> to be as clean-running and organic as his own human body. Part of {{the design of the}} character was to give the other characters a true boss [...] an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines, even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it hard to argue with him." [...] As a result, Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character. In his earlier episodes, Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people. As city manager in later episodes as a regular, however, Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them. For example, Chris began to enforce his strict no-dating policy around city hall. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Jerry's Painting", Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial, and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders.|$|E

According to Hall, [...] "all Shakespeare's thinking, whether religious, political or moral, is based upon a complete acceptance of this concept of order. There is a just proportion in all things: man is above beast, king is above man, and God above king [...] Revolution, whether in the individual's temperament, in the family, or in the state or the heavens, destroys the order and leads to destructive anarchy." [...] Indeed, the program notes for Henry VI included an article entitled [...] "The Cycle of a Curse," [...] which states that [...] "as Orestes was haunted in Greek drama, so Englishmen fight each other to expunge the curse pronounced upon Bolingbroke's usurpation of the tragically weak Richard II." [...] Similarly, in the notes for Edward IV, Hall wrote, [...] "underlying these plays is the curse on the House of Lancaster. Bolingbroke deposed Richard II to become Henry IV. Richard II was a weak and sometimes a bad king, ungoverned, unbalanced; he could not order <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b> Yet for Shakespeare, his deposition is a wound on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>politic,</b> which festers through reign after reign, a sin which can only be expiated by blood-letting.
