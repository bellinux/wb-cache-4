This quality factor {{is influenced by}} the internal noise such as engine noise, and external noise such as aerodynamic noise and <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise.</b> Whereas many studies have been done to identify noise sources and reduce the noise and vibration transmission from the engine and aerodynamic sources to the passenger compartment, the <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> reduction outside the compartment still remains challenging. It is known that the exterior <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> being regulated by European legislation under ECE R 117 and EC R 661 / 2009 but for the interior <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise,</b> it is only regulated by market requirement (consumer orientated).

40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{associated}} with several health problems and welfare; such as sleep disturbances and annoyance. Accordingly, it becomes essential to characterize road noise not only based on acoustic indicators, but also based on psychoacoustic indicators. The acoustic indicators are required to assure compliance with European legislation and to define vehicle detection thresholds, the psychoacoustic indicators describe better annoyance rates. In this context, this work aimed to explore <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> measurements acquired on eight road pavements at eight speeds, {{from the point of}} view of psychoacoustics. In the analysis three psychoacoustic indicators (Loudness, Sharpness, Roughness) and one acoustic indicator (LAmax) were determined on 64 <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> samples acquired through the Close Proximity Method (CPX).

40|$|In {{national}} and European discussions, {{it appears that}} the conventional sound measurement techniques are insufficient to answer some relevant questions with respect to source strength of road vehicles. An example of such a question is: What is the importance of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> {{on the one hand and}} drive-line noise on the other hand in every day traffic? TNO TPD has developed measurement techniques, based on array technology, that enable the assessment of source strengths of complex sound sources, such as passing road vehicles, passing trains or industrial sources. These methods aim to distinguish the different partial sources in one dimension (Syntacan) or two dimensions (Acoustic Camera) and to measure their calibrated source-strength levels. The Dutch ministry of Environment (VROM) supported the application of these techniques by TNO TPD within the European HARMONOISE project. The objective was to show the ability of array measurements to provide both sound exposure levels (SELs) and heights. Tests were conducted at TRL (UK) to determine the accuracy of two array methods developed by TNO TPD by comparison with the subtraction method. The data measured by TNO TPD resulted in one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional 'sound photographs' of the vehicles, in different circumstances. The 'sound photographs' present calibrated source strength levels with similar accuracy as those obtained with single microphone techniques measured by TRL and on top of that, provide spatial information of the source strength distribution. Based on these results it can be concluded that the Acoustic Camera and Syntacan can serve in the assessment of road, vehicle noise. This could be done in various ways and for various objectives such as monitoring of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> in real traffic, determining effects of the road surface on <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> and drive-line noise...|$|E

Thus, {{as a first step}} to the subject, laboratory tests were conducted on two asphalt mixtures containing rubber or cork granulates and their performance was compared to that of a conventional mixture.

TNO TPD has developed array measurement techniques that enable the assessment of 'calibrated' source strengths levels of moving complex sound sources and provide spatial information of the source strength distribution. The Dutch ministry of Environment (VROM) supported the application of these techniques by TNO TPD in a joint experiment with TRL within the European HARMONOISE project.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> models {{by using a}} Data Mining approach that allowed to build a predictive model and assess {{the importance of the}} tested input variables. The data modelling took into account three learning algorithms and three metrics to define the best predictive model. The variables tested included basic properties of pavement surfaces, macrotexture, megatexture, and uneven- ness and, for the first time, damping. Also, the importance of those variables was measured by using a sensitivity analysis procedure. Two types of models were set: one with basic variables and another with complex variables, such as megatexture and damping, all as a function of vehicles speed. More detailed models were additionally set by the speed level. As a result, several models with very good <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> predictive capacity were achieved. The most relevant variables were Speed, Temperature, Aggregate size, Mean Profile Depth, and Damping, which had the highest importance, even though influenced by speed. Megatexture and IRI had the lowest importance. The applicability of the models developed in this work is relevant for trucks tyre-noise prediction, represented by the AVON V 4 test tyre, at the early stage of road pavements use. Therefore, the obtained models are highly useful for the design of pavements and for noise prediction by road authorities and contractors.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> prediction, a computationally efficient {{high frequency}} tyre model is needed. Such models {{are always a}} compromise between the desired accuracy {{and the need for}} simplicity. In addition the accuracy of models is often limited by the quality of the input data available. For passenger car or truck tyres, a complete set of input data can be obtained only from the tyre manufacturer. However, this may not always be possible and one has to rely instead on approximate material data obtained from the careful study of experiments conducted on tyres. Although much research is available for passenger car tyres, less attention is paid to truck tyres. The work described in this thesis has the goal to close this gap by an experimental investigation of the vibrational behaviour of a truck tyre exposed to external forces. Driving point mobility and transfer mobility measurements are made to understand the behaviour of truck tyres, to gain insight into what may be the most suitable way to model truck tyres, and to extract material data for this modelling. A methodology was developed, which allows for the calculation of key tyre parameters, such as total bending stiffness and Youngs modulus from driving point mobility. These parameters are used in a 3 -D orthotropic double-plate model based on elastic field equations as developed for passenger tyres. A WFEM model is also used to understand the limitations of modelling a tyre as a structure with homogenous geometry (i. e. thickness and material properties identical over the whole cross section). Results from the 3 -D orthotropic double plate model are compared with measured tyre response functions. One can conclude from these results that the data obtained from measurements, as well as the model, can successfully be used later for simulation of contact forces in the <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> prediction models. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> is {{a serious}} problem. One of the {{parameters}} to reduce the noise radiation is the sound absorption coefficient of the road, which is (partly) determined by properties such as the porosity of the road, {{the size and shape}} of the stones. In this study, a novel `hybrid' (analytical/numerical) model is used to predict the three-dimensional sound field in and above porous structures [...] modelled as rigid granular structures [...] and to predict the absorption coefficient for oblique incident sound waves. In this modelling approach, the air inside the pores of the structure is considered, including viscothermal effects in the pores and scattering of the sound waves due to the, assumed, rigid granular structure, representing the pavement. In this paper, the validation of the hybrid (analytical/numerical) modelling approach with impedance tube measurements for normal incident sound waves is described for two three-dimensional configurations.

40|$|The regular {{tyre tread}} pattern design process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior tyre tread pattern noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise.</b> The three most important tyre tread pattern noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the tyre tread pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three tyre tread pattern noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior tyre tread pattern noise. From these tyre tread pattern noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the tyre tread pattern noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of tyre tread patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of tyre tread pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current tyre tread patter design process...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} a well known problem. For speeds above {{approximately}} 40 km/h the noise is mostly <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise.</b> The noise level depends on the tyre, {{the road and the}} interaction between the tyre and the road. There are various well-known methods to measure <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> and in this paper the measurement results of CPX, impedance tube and road roughness measurements are combined to investigate the relation between the radiated noise and the tyre tread design and road characteristics. All measurements have taken place on a special test area at Airport Twente, where 8 different type of asphalt surfaces were constructed. Two these tracks are based on new models for sound absorption and grip. Six of the tracks are porous asphalt concrete. To investigate the relation between tyre tread design and the sound radiation, three simple parameters are defined based on properties that are commonly considered when researching the influence of tyre tread. However, the parameters defined in this paper are simplified, such that they can be applied when no detailed knowledge of the tyre properties is available. The relation between road characteristics and sound radiation is investigated using the properties of the road, such as stone size, porosity and sound absorption, and some texture parameters as defined by the International Organisation of Standardization (ISO). The correlation between the tyre and road parameters and the sound radiation is investigated, both for the root mean square values and the octave bands of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. The results show that both the tyre parameters as the road characteristics, such as porosity of the road and the sound absorption by the road, are important for a decrease in sound radiation. The influence of the porosity of the road and the sound absorption by the road on the radiated sound is more significant for the frequencies in the octave band of 2000 Hz than the influence of the investigated tyre treads on the radiated sound. However, in the octave band of 1000 Hz, the influence of the tyre tread parameters on the sound radiation is larger. Furthermore, a relation is found between the radiated sound and the maximum stone sizes in the asphalt concrete. The measurements show a clear correlation between the sound absorption of the tested tracks and the radiated sound: for an increasing sound absorption coefficient the sound radiation decreases. Moreover, the total sound radiation decreases more when the sound absorption of higher frequencies is increased...|$|E

However, road noise raises several questions because, if on one hand is associated with several health problems and welfare, on the other hand its lack affects the detection of the sound sources, and consequently it constitutes a risk to the safety of road users. Thus, it becomes essential to classify road pavements not only based on acoustic indicators but also based on psychoacoustic indicators.

The necessary <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> measurements were performed on {{a representative sample of}} commercial car tyres (n = 143). Apart from summer tyres, a limited number of winter and cross-country tyres were included in the sample. Tests also included remoulds as well as new tyres. Measurements were made on two different surfaces, an 0 / 8 asphalt concrete and 0 / 11 mastic asphalt. The former surface corresponds to the requirements of ISO standard 10844 (surface for vehicle homologation tests); the latter is typical for roads outside built-up areas. The study showed that the trailer drive-by method is fundamentally suitable for determining sound emission from car tyres. To ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, the tractor vehicle must, however, be fitted with especially low-noise tyres and additional screening in the tyre area. In certain cases (when very low-noise tyres are being measured) the above steps are insufficient to guarantee a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB(A) (minimum signal-to-noise ratio: 7 dB(A)). This problem was, however, solved by means of special 'calibration drives' with the tractor vehicle and by subtracting the tractor vehicle energy component. (orig.)

The noise measurements were modelled on the homologation test method, {{at a distance}} of 7. 5 m {{to the side of the}} vehicle and a height of 1. 2 m above road surface level, using random samples. In the 1992 study, approximatley 33 000 powered vehicles were registered at a total of 30 locations. 26 of the selected locations had remained unchanged except for the road surfacings as compared to earlier studies. In general, the results showed that the reduction in powered vehicle noise limits over the last 15 years has not led to a corresponding reduction in real traffic emissions. Only in the case of medium-sized and heavy lorries and of local public transport buses has there been a significant improvement in the situation. Real traffic emissions from cars show a slight fall only in the case of starting-off and acceleration, car emissions in moving traffic have slightly increased. The low effectiveness of the limit reductions underlines the need to continue efforts at reducing engine and transmission noises, but also the need for better matching of measuring conditions with real traffic operating modes, in order to enhance the efficiency of limit reductions. In addition, there is a need for increased development of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> reduction measures. These must start both from the tyres and from the road surfacing.

40|$|A {{cataloguing}} of road pavements {{is proposed}} {{based on the}} acoustic performances of the surfacings {{as a function of}} the type of pavement, its state of maintenance and the type of degradations present. The catalogue has been compiled using data from the most recent experiments conducted by the University of Padova on <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise,</b> evaluated with the “Close Proximity Method”. This method, which allows the reference system for the measurement of noise to be shifted from an external receptor fixed at the roadside, to one fixed on the vehicle, has allowed many types of pavements to be investigated relatively quickly and easily. The acoustic characterisation of the pavements is based on both the equivalent sound level generated by the vehicles on different pavements and on spectral distribution. This latter, equivalent level being equal, is necessary for identifying the field of frequency where the sound energy is concentrated, and therefore to characterise the greater or lesser “disturbance” caused by the noise. Frequency analysis of the components of the rolling noise also allows the combination of materials to be selected at the design stage, which satisfies, as well as the requisites of adhesion and evenness, also that of low noise. The classification regards mainly urban roads built with traditional close-textured and open-graded bituminous concrete, rehabilitation overlays, surface treatments and segmental pavings, but also includes the porous asphalt wearing courses traditionally used in extra-urban environments. The acoustic efficiency of road markings was also verified in the study. The state of maintenance was determined by both visual observation and on the basis of the surface texture level, quantified using the MPD index. The compilation of the catalogue has thrown light on the acoustic effect of the most common pavement degradations on the basis of type, seriousness and extent. This kind of evaluation represents a useful support when planning roadway construction and maintenance, especially in built-up areas...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} noise regulations concerning automotive vehicles {{particularly in}} Europe are forcing Tyre manufacturers {{as well as}} the automotive manufacturers to reduce radiated noise. With the future moving towards electric/hybrid vehicles, the ever present tyre noise will become more dominant. Even in the case of automotive engines running on fossil fuels, tyre noise dominates above speeds of 40 Km/h. Understanding the causes of tyre noise is the first step towards finding engineering solutions to reduce it. Numerical modelling can help the tyre engineer in understanding the causes of <b>tyre-road</b> <b>noise</b> with a design tool. In the present work, the noise radiated by the tyre surface is computed numerically using three different computational techniques. Both the time domain approach and the frequency domain approaches are used and the results are compared. The input structural vibrations are computed in ABAQUS (Ref. 1) and the results are then imported to LMSVirtual. Lab (Ref. 2) for further acoustic computations. As the main focus of this work is on the acoustic computations, only {{a brief description of the}} process involved in the structural vibration calculations is provided. In the present work, the “Horn effect” is inherently captured in the acoustic simulations. Two model tyres, viz., with tread pattern and with circumferential grooves is evaluated. The presence of tread leads to the phenomenon of stick slip and stick snap mechanisms contributing to the overall tyre noise. In addition, the motion of air through the grooves causes air pumping noise. It is to be noted that the structural vibration computations were performed on a rotating tyre that translated on a stationary road. In other words, the tyre underwent rotational as well as translational displacement. The acoustic computations are however performed on a stationary tyre model. One of the challenges addressed in the present work is the conversion of transient vibration results on a stationary acoustic mesh. The surface accelerations, required as boundary conditions, are converted to the frequency domain by the Fast Fourier Transformation for the Harmonic computations. The details of the structural models {{as well as the}} acoustic models and a short description of the techniques used in the computations of the radiated noise are described in the next section...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{improvements}} in combustion engines and electric engines for cars, tyre noise {{has become the}} prominent noise source at low and medium speeds. Models exist that simulate the noise produced by a rolling tyre, as do models that auralize specific traffic situations from a basic data set. A model that combines both could assist in the planning stage of a tyre by delivering not only estimates of the physical behaviour of the tyre, but also by further making the resulting sound perceivable. Further, such a model could help to design acoustic traffic situations with full control of all parameters. Focusing on that, this thesis has three aims. All {{focus is on the}} perception of the sound of a car from the outside, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian.  The first aim is to combine an established model for tyre noise (SPERoN) with an auralization tool. The combined model can predict the spectrum of a car pass-by at 7. 5 m, as well as reproduce the sound at a given listener position.  Psychoacoustic judgements are used to compare the modelled signals with recorded signals.  It was found that responses for simulated and recorded signals correlated for all cases, but the ranked orders differed slightly.  The second aim focuses on the perception of <b>tyre–road</b> <b>noise</b> and whether it can be differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. When designing tyre sounds, the main aim should be to increase the pleasantness of the total vehicle sound while maintaining the carried information and reducing the sound level. Achieving this requires an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of that tyre.  Listeners were asked to judge different tyre–road combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional and psychoacoustic responses. The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated.  The third aim in this thesis was to increase understanding of the parameters that influence the detection of a single car in background traffic noise. For this, both variations in the sound of the test car and in the background (e. g. distance, traffic amount, speed, tyre/engine noise) were investigated and found to influence the reaction time. The introduced auralization method was utilized to generate the sound files for the different traffic situations. <br /...|$|E
