40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study of {{presented}} discourse in popular science narratives of discovery in English. It focuses on the fictionalizing role of presented discourse. The thesis proposes minor adjustments to the existing models of presented discourse analysis, dividing discourse presentation into Public Discourse (speech/writing) and Private Discourse (thought). After exploring the forms and functions of discourse presentation in <b>the</b> <b>narratives,</b> <b>the</b> thesis concludes that Private Discourse prefers the forms commonly associated with non-fiction while assigning to them the functions most often observed in fiction. All the forms of discourse presentation in <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> contain dramatizing properties, yet Public Discourse possesses the highest degree of dramatization. Private Discourse in <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> possesses communicative properties generally assigned to speech/writing presentation exclusively. Private Discourse {{is more likely to}} communicate scientific hypotheses than reveal the inner worlds of actants. The thesis concludes with an examination of presented discourse outside <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> of discovery. This analysis confirms the phenomena observed in <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> and reveals a unique feature of presented discourse outside the narratives-the fictionalized reader-a fictional actant created using discourse presentation. The findings of the thesis present a strong argument in favour of fictionality in popular science...|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} one current maps of Israel were {{analysed}} for their modern mapping religious ele-ments {{in respect of}} the Holy Land. The main issues of the study are which religious elements appear and their form of representation {{in the range of}} maps; the impressions that can be derived from the different maps; and <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> that can be construed from this representation. The research methods applied were hermeneutics and semiotics. <b>Narratives</b> identified on <b>the</b> various maps were the 'holy' vs <b>the</b> 'secular' <b>narrative,</b> <b>the</b> 'holy Christian' <b>narrative,</b> <b>the</b> Jewish <b>narrative,</b> and <b>the</b> Muslim <b>narrative.</b> <b>The</b> Christian <b>narrative</b> proved <b>the</b> most dominant, while <b>the</b> Muslim <b>narrative</b> was rarely found in the maps, even in those with a 'Palestinian' narrative. Religious maps evinced a special carto-graphic status because of their subjective nature and their attempt to combine contemporary reality with the tradition of maps of the ancient Holy Land. A ubiquitous finding was disregard for political issues, although the maps' messages allow the map user to draw conclusions about ideology, images and conflicts. The semiotic method was found appropriate and suitable for reading the maps. Copyright (c) 2005 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG. ...|$|R
