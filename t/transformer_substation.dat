This paper describes the planning algorithms proposed to optimize the location, size, and supply area of the mediumvoltage/ low-voltage <b>transformer</b> <b>substations</b> in an RNM that has to plan a network from scratch (Greenfield planning). The presented methodology aims to divide the entire planning area into small zones with a nonpredetermined area so that each one can be optimized separately. Then, a heuristic process based on -means algorithm seeks to find the set of clusters that minimize the cost function, considering {{the cost of the}} <b>transformer</b> <b>substations,</b> as well as the LV and MV network costs.

On the basis of 5 projects of the 156 key construction projects in the first five-year plan, it has developed to be a large-size enterprise group taking research institutions and backbone enterprises as its core as well as merging research, development, production, trade and finance as an organic whole. In 2001, being approved by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People's Republic of China, China XD Group was established formally with XD Company as its parent company. In 2003, XD Company became the only central enterprise of the power transmission and distribution industry {{under the supervision of}} the State Property Management Commission of the State Council. On May 6, 2009, being approved by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People's Republic of China, China XD Company formally changed its name to be China XD Group and decided to name it XD Group for short. 　　XD Group’s main business includes the research and development, design, production, sales and examinations of power transmission and distribution and control equipment, relevant equipment technology and service in a complete set, engineering contracting, etc. Its core business is the production, the research and development and the examinations of high voltage, extra high voltage and extreme high voltage AC/DC power transmission and distribution equipment. Its leading products include 110KV and above voltage level of high-voltage switches (GIS, GCB, isolating switches, ground switches), transformers (power transformers, converter transformers), reactors (smoothing reactors，shunt reactors)，power condensers，instrument transformers（CVT、CT、PT），insulators (power substation electric porcelain products，composite insulator products)，cannula, zinc oxide arresters, direct current transportation valves, etc. After a half century’s struggle and development, XD Group has become the production base of high-voltage, extra high voltage and extreme high voltage AC/DC power transmission and distribution equipment and other electrical products, which has the largest scale and strongest capacity of complete set in China. 　　At present, XD Group owns over 40 wholly owned enterprises or holding enterprises, during which there’re 10 large or medium key production enterprises and 3 research institutions (including 3 national testing centers). It has more than 18,000 employees, and over 3000 of them are engineers and technicians, including 529 persons with intermediate and senior professional titles, 35 experts enjoying the government special subsidy that the State Council distributes, and 49 young experts with outstanding contributions at the provincial and municipal level. During the years, XD Group has made a great breakthrough in the key technical field of extreme high voltage universal power transmission and distribution equipment, led the way in China in researching and developing line products for 750KV power network, and succeeded in developing 800kV GIS，couple cut-off pot-type breakers, isolating switches and transformers of 750kV, reactors, lightning arresters, etc. As China’s experimental research establishment of high voltage, intense current and large capacity AC/DC, XD Group’s subordinate research institutions have become not only the member of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems (CIGRE), but also the specified administrative department of IEC in China and the relevant international Secretariat. In recent years, according to the needs of the national key projects and market, XD Group has been continuously intensifying research and technical reforms, therefore it has accomplished more than 1300 items of new key products developed by itself, among which 281 items reached international most advanced level, 230 items reached national most advanced level, 11 items won national scientific and technical awards, 136 items won provincial or ministerial scientific and technical awards, as well as 260 patents were authorized and 2 items got the copyright of computer software.
