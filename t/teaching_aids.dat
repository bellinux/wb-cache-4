40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> of electrometer based on Coulomb’s law for twelfth grade of Senior high school and university students studying on fundamental physics. This research is done on december 2013 at laboratory of physics education, State University of Jakarta. The <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> of electrometer was demonstrated in physics learning to fifteen university students participating as test object. Method used in {{this research}} is research and development. Result of need analysis shows that development of <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> of electrometer is needed in physics learning. <b>Teaching</b> <b>aid</b> of electrometer is <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> used to help students understanding Coulomb’s law. Teachers doing experiment, lecturers teaching fundamental physics, and university students doing research about coulomb’s law can use the <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> of electrometer. The <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> is validated by media and concept experts in Likert scale.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the development of}} a violin <b>teaching</b> <b>aid,</b> called ViTool, which is based on violin pedagogy, sound analysis, and comparison of beginner and good player recordings. It is a computer based <b>teaching</b> <b>aid</b> and will ultimately consist of at least four task dependent tools. Typical beginner faults have been identified and features, that best describe them for classification purposes, are considered. The ViTool is not intended as a replacement or electronic teacher, but as a <b>teaching</b> <b>aid.</b> Presently, it seems that no such violin learning aid or tool exists and an opportunity exists for the development of such home learning aids.

25|$|The {{practical}} {{magic of}} Abramelin (found in both Book III of the French text, and Book IV of the German original) centers around {{a set of}} talismans composed of magic word squares. These are similar to traditional magic squares, though the latter are usually composed of numbers, while Abramelin's squares contain letters. Commonly word squares are used as puzzles or as <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> for students. In the context of Abramelin, the focus becomes mystical—so that each square should contain words or names {{that relate to the}} magical goal of the square. A parallel is found in the famous Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas word square, an altered version of which is also found among Abramelin's squares.|$|E
25|$|Taking a {{particular}} interest {{in the fields of}} public archaeology and cultural heritage studies, he appointed new staff members to teach courses in such topics, and was involved in founding the Public Archaeology journal, initially edited by honorary lecturer Neal Ascherson. Keen on increasing the IoA's publishing output, he oversaw the creation of Archaeology International, a journal that first appeared in 1998, combining the roles of the former Bulletin of the Institute of Archaeology and the Annual Report, edited by David R. Harris. After Cavendish Press, publishers of the UCL Press imprint, were bought out by Taylor and Francis, Ucko initiated successful talks with Left Coast Press for the IoA to publish future works through them. He also emphasised the importance of the artefact collections owned by UCL and IoA, believing that they had great potential as <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> and for public outreach.|$|E
25|$|Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, {{and artistic}} {{literature}} {{are used in}} Nanai language teaching. Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well. However, {{there is a shortage}} of teaching and auxiliary materials, as well as difficulty in motivating students. Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of heritage language preservation. Moreover, the existing language teaching materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs. Instruction in spoken language is not conducted sufficiently and is not reinforced by <b>teaching</b> <b>aids.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Brazilian {{medical schools}} follow the European {{model of a}} six-year curriculum, divided into three cycles of two years each. The first two years are called basic cycle (ciclo básico). During this time {{students}} are instructed in the basic sciences (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, immunology etc.) with activities integrated with the medical specialties, allowing the student {{an overview of the}} practical application of such content. After its completion, the students advance to the clinical cycle (ciclo clinico). At this stage contacts with patients intensify and work with tests and diagnostics, putting into practice what was learned in the first two years. The last two are called cycle internship (ciclo do internato). In this last step the students focus on clinical practice, through training in teaching hospitals and clinics. The teaching of this last step respecting an axis of increasing complexity, enabling students to make decisions and participate effectively in form and operative care under the direct supervision of faculty and qualified to act as <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> physicians.
