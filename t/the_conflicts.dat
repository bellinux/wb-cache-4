We can summarise the solutions for manage <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> into three different approaches: first, we can try to suppress or reduce <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> before <b>the</b> combination step, secondly, we can manage <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in order to give no influence of <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in <b>the</b> combination step, and then take into account <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in <b>the</b> decision step, thirdly, we can take into account <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in <b>the</b> combination step. The first approach is certainly the better, but not always feasible. It is difficult to say which approach is the best between the second and the third. However, the most important is the produced results in applications. We propose here a new combination rule that distributes <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> proportionally on <b>the</b> element given this conflict. We compare these different combination rules on real data in Sonar imagery and Radar target classification...|$|R

To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to pull apart the {{narratives}} used by Yemeni, Saudi and Iranian news agencies concerning <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, {{in order to understand}} how <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> is framed by these agencies. In approaching the research question; How do the contending narratives of Saudi, Iranian, and Yemeni news agencies frame <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen between March 2015 and May 2016 ?, this thesis identifies and analyses the narratives each of these agencies use to portray <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, using a theoretical framework built around the concept of framing to analyse how each agency places blame, proposes solutions, and positions their country within <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> through <b>the</b> concepts and language they use to create their narratives. The analysis seeks to understand each agency’s stance towards <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> and analyse how this is perpetuated by their news coverage in order to further justify their understanding of, and intended outcome for, <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen. By outlining the role that the narratives in the media play in shaping the audience’s attitude, this thesis highlights the relevance of identifying and analysing how such narratives are framed. Rather than aiming to uncover facts, or truths, about <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, its relevance lies in the result of highlighting and analysing the claims made by these news agencies, thus identifying points of contention between them and serving as an alternative perspective through which to understand the battle of words and ideas that is taking place surrounding <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b> An awareness of the framing processes used to shape contending understandings of <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> and <b>the</b> solutions they propose, will allow a more critical overview of <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> as it unfolds. Furthermore, this research highlights how a set of core concepts was manipulated by each agency; using the same bank of concepts to frame their evaluation of, and proposed solution for, <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen...|$|R

40|$|In Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person, Harry Frankfurt {{put forward}} a theory that what is {{essential}} {{to be a person}} is second-order volition.
