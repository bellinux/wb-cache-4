50|$|Lowside crashes do {{not usually}} occur <b>through</b> <b>braking</b> in a {{straight}} line in dry conditions. It's more likely that the rider will go over the handlebars through too much front wheel brake force or will lock the rear wheel resulting {{in a straight}} skid. The name derives {{from the fact that it}} is the inward side the motorcycle will fall on (or the side that points downward in a curve, the low side), therefore some turning must be occurring for it to happen. A rider braking {{in a straight line}} on a cambered road could still experience a lowside crash if either of the wheels lock <b>through</b> <b>braking</b> as the bike will slide sideways with gravity down the camber.|$|R

50|$|A {{brakeman}} is a {{rail transport}} worker whose original {{job was to}} assist the braking of a train by applying brakes on individual wagons. The earliest known {{use of the term}} to describe this occupation occurred in 1833. The advent of <b>through</b> <b>brakes</b> on trains made this role redundant, although the name lives on (albeit now considered to be gender-neutral) in the United States where brakemen carry out a variety of functions both on the track and within trains.|$|R
60|$|The sheego, at {{the same}} instant, was smitten with an identically similar impulse.

60|$|The abrupt exits and entrances, {{which are}} necessitated {{on the real}} stage by the {{inevitable}} limitations of space, were in many cases done away with, and we saw the characters coming gradually towards us <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> and underwood, or passing away down the slope till they were lost in some deep recess of the forest; the effect of distance thus gained being largely increased by the faint wreaths of blue mist that floated at times across the background. Indeed I never saw an illustration at once so perfect and so practical of the aesthetic value of smoke.|$|E
60|$|The bare {{probability}} {{of such a}} dreadful calamity was sufficient to put to flight all my previous terrors. I now cared nothing whatever for the loathsome reptiles that wallowed in the swamps around me, and the quiet glidings and swelterings of whose hideous forms were distinctly audible in the stillness of approaching night. My whole anxiety was centred on Jack. I thought that if I could prevail on him to rest he might recover, and proposed that we should encamp; {{but he would not}} hear of this. He kept plunging on, staggering <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> and swamp, reedy pond and quaking morass, until I felt myself utterly unable to follow him a step farther.|$|E

50|$|The master {{cylinder}} is located behind the driver’s side dashboard {{mounted on the}} vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the {{master cylinder}} is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated <b>through</b> the <b>brake</b> lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed <b>through</b> the <b>brake</b> lines, the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the master cylinder).|$|R
60|$|So {{every day}} the old doctor and I hunted the cure-all plant among the {{mountains}} and valleys of the Blue Ridge.

We waded through gorges and chasms, breast-deep with laurel and ferns; we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles; we wound our way like Indians <b>through</b> <b>brakes</b> of pine--road side, hill side, river side, mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant.|$|R

'T {{was one of}} the charmèd days When {{the genius}} of God doth flow; The wind may alter twenty ways, A tempest cannot blow; It may blow north, it still is warm; Or south, it still is clear; Or east, it smells like a clover-farm; Or west, no thunder fear. The musing peasant, lowly great, Beside the forest water sate; The rope-like pine-roots {{crosswise}} grown Composed the network of his throne; The wide lake, edged with sand and grass, Was burnished to a floor of glass, Painted with shadows green and proud Of the tree and of the cloud. He was the heart of all the scene; On him the sun looked more serene; To hill and cloud his face was known,-- It seemed the likeness of their own; They knew by secret sympathy The public child of earth and sky. 'You ask,' he said, 'what guide Me through trackless thickets led, Through thick-stemmed woodlands rough and wide. I found the water's bed. The watercourses were my guide; I travelled grateful by their side, Or through their channel dry; They led me through the thicket damp, <b>Through</b> <b>brake</b> and fern, the beavers' camp, Through beds of granite cut my road, And their resistless friendship showed. The falling waters led me, The foodful waters fed me, And brought me to the lowest land, Unerring to the ocean sand. The moss upon the forest bark Was pole-star when the night was dark; The purple berries in the wood Supplied me necessary food; For Nature ever faithful is To such as trust her faithfulness.

6000|$|So {{without more}} words they started forward, peering about {{them as they}} went. Soon the forest thickened, and the track they {{followed}} wound its way round great trunks of primeval oaks, or the edges of bog-holes, or <b>through</b> <b>brakes</b> of thorns. Hard enough it was to find it at times, since the snow made it one with the bordering ground, and the gloom of the oaks was great.

50|$|Most {{automotive}} professionals {{agree that}} glycol-based brake fluid, (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5.1) should be flushed, or changed, every 1-2 years under non-racing conditions. Many manufacturers also require periodic fluid changes to ensure reliability and safety. Once installed, moisture diffuses into the fluid <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> hoses and rubber seals and, eventually, the fluid {{will have to}} be replaced when the water content becomes too high. Electronic testers and test strips are commercially available to measure moisture content, however moisture test strips were taken off the market because they absorb moisture in the air before they can be used. The corrosion inhibitors also degrade over time. Degraded inhibitors cause corrosion in the braking system. The first metal to corrode is copper. You can determine when it is time to replace brake fluid when copper ions hit 200ppm. New fluid should always be stored in a sealed container to avoid moisture intrusion.|$|E
50|$|Running {{steadily}} to the flag, the Aston Martin {{crossed the}} finish line after 2,210.78 miles (261 laps) of racing with Robin Hamilton, who had driven longest of the three drivers, at the wheel. RHAM/1 finished in 17th place overall (from 55 starters) and 3rd in class (GTP category), ironically, if it had stayed in Group 5 it would have finished 2nd in class. Pit stops totalled 3 hours and fuel consumption worked out at 5.75 mpg. With RHAM/1 using a maximum engine speed of 6,400 rpm, averaging 92.12 mph (including stops) or 104.70 mph (excluding stops). The fastest lap in the car was by Hamilton, recording 4 minutes 34.2 seconds (average speed of 112.25 mph). 18 of the 24 hours were driven with cracked front brake discs, the car was later given the name of 'Muncher' due to the rate that the car got <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> discs.|$|E
5000|$|Washington was a {{frequent}} fox hunter, and Lee became his huntsman (the person {{in charge of the}} hounds or dogs), a role that required expert horsemanship. In his memoirs, Washington's step-grandson George Washington Parke Custis described Lee during a hunt:Will, the huntsman, better known in Revolutionary lore as Billy, rode a horse called Chinkling, a surprising leaper, and made very much like its rider, low, but sturdy, and of great bone and muscle. Will had but one order, which was to keep with the hounds; and, mounted on Chinkling ... this fearless horseman would rush, at full speed, <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> or tangled wood, in a style at which modern huntsmen would stand aghast.Before the Revolutionary War, Lee often traveled with Washington to the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, or on journeys such as a surveying expedition to the Ohio Valley in 1770 and to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1774. Lee served at Washington's side throughout the eight years of the Revolutionary War, including the winter at Valley Forge and at the siege of Yorktown. According to historian Fritz Hirschfeld, Lee [...] "rode alongside Washington in the thick of battle, ready to hand over to the general a spare horse or his telescope or whatever else might be needed." ...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{damage of}} rails can occur <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> lock-up, or {{traction}} control system failure to prevent wheel spin. In most cases the damage produced is shallow and {{takes the form of}} a "white etching layer", usually thought to have a martensitic structure, formed as the steel is heated above its eutectoid temperature and then rapidly cooled as the wheel moves away. In many cases such layers are benign, but there is evidence of crack initiation at their interface with the sub-surface layers of the rail in “stud” defects. The metallurgical transformation during the formation of white etching layers leads to a volume change for the steel, leaving not only a transformed microstructure, but also locked-in stress. The influence of this additional locked-in stress on development of an initiated crack is studied in this paper, and the work extended to consider how alternative materials which react differently to the thermal input may offer a means to suppress crack development through locking in beneficial rather than problematic stresses...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} brake performance measurements for a high speed Road Racing Supersport motorbike engine. A modular approach consisting in a progressive assembling of each component belonging to the intake and exhaust systems is used to investigate the influence of these components on volumetric efficiency <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> torque chassis dynamometer tests. In spite of the design effort that is usually made to keep the cylinder air intake independent {{of each other in}} this kind of engines, results showed a considerable acoustic coupling between the intake primary manifolds and the upstream components. Moreover, a good correspondence is found about intake and exhaust tuning regimes between experimental results and analytical relationships proposed in the literature. The presented results can also be interpreted as representative for the overall very high speed engines category (including MotoGP and F 1 ones), being the air-breathing system layout mostly independent of engine technological level within this category...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A {{large number}} of workers in the USA are exposed to {{chrysotile}} asbestos <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> repair, yet only a few cases of malignant mesothelioma (MM) have been described in this population. Epidemiologic and industrial hygiene studies have failed to demonstrate {{an increased risk of}} MM in brake workers. We present our experience of MM in individuals whose only known asbestos exposure was to brake dust and correlate these findings with lung asbestos fiber burdens. Methods: Consultation files of one of the authors were reviewed for cases of MM in which brake dust was the only known asbestos exposure. Lung fiber analyses were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in all cases for which formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded lung tissue was available. Results: Ten cases of MM in brake dust-exposed individuals were males aged 51 – 73 yr. Nine cases arose in the pleura and one in the peritoneum. Although the median lung asbestos body count (19 AB/g) is at our upper limit of normal (range 0 – 20 AB/g), half of the cases had levels within our normal range. In every case with elevated asbestos fiber levels by SEM, excess commercial amphibole fibers were also detected. Elevated levels of chrysotile and non-commer...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale use of leaded {{gasoline}} {{was an important}} source of the neurotoxin lead in the European environment. After a sequence of regulations on the allowed gasoline lead content and, eventually, a ban on the use of lead additives in gasoline, road transport was no longer considered a source of atmospheric lead. Currently a discrepancy exists between measured atmospheric lead concentrations and model-predicted concentrations, suggesting that lead emissions to the atmosphere may be underestimated. Recently it was suggested that lead emission from un{{leaded gasoline}} combustion is still an important source and may (partly) fill the gap between modelled and observed atmospheric lead concentrations. In this paper we assess the plausibility of the latter suggestion by following various emission estimation methodologies. The uncertainty of lead emissions from road transport is further reduced by chemical analysis of fuel samples. The result of our assessment is that lead from road transport fuel combustion is not the missing lead source needed to fill the gap between modelled and observed lead concentrations. Road transport is still a source of lead <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> wear and a small contribution from exhaust emissions but this contributes no more than 5 - 8 % of the EU 25 total emission. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, diffuse {{emissions}} of metals {{have become the}} dominating source of copper towater. This thesis work made an attempt to link the source of copper emission {{and the fate of}} the copper in a lake. These models have been applied in the case study of Lake Råcksta Träsk and its urban drainage area in Stockholm, Sweden. The source analysis model has been adopted and modified from Cui et al (2008) and Sörme and Lagerkvist (2002) and the basic fate model has been taken and modified from Håkanson (2006) and Lindström and Håkanson (2001). For better understanding and improving the modelling, a second type of modelling approach both for source(i. e. StormTac model) and fate analyses (i. e. QWASI model) have been included in this study. The results from the different modelling approaches are compared. Models were presented in an as transparent as possible way and were connected through the urban copper load to the lake. All models were tested against previously published monitoring data. In the source analysis, the traffic and road sections emit the most of copper especially <b>through</b> <b>brake</b> linings of the vehicles. The lakemodel was evaluated using monitoring data from the 15 -year period, 1991 - 2006. Both the water and sediment copper contents respond to a change in the copper load to the lake, but the response is slower for the sediments. Thus it is proposed that the sediment copper contents can be used to follow urban copper emissions. www. ima. kth. se</p...|$|E
