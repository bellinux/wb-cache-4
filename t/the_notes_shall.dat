Precisely, as small delay interval assumption is imposed, sufficient conditions are obtained there to ensure the almost sure exponential stability of the mild solutions of the given stochastic systems. Unfortunately, the main results derived by him are somewhat restrictive to be applied for practical purposes.

The material to be presented has the added advantage of almost being in an algorithm i. e form so that coding of the same for test problems is relatively straightforward. The justification for our choice of Osher scheme for presentation in these lectures is (1) unlike schemes based on linearized approximate Riemann solvers, {{such as that of}} Roe, Osher scheme is known to be entropy consistent and not susceptible to some of the defects mentioned above (2) an unified approach to the interior scheme and boundary scheme is possible, and (3) the resulting algorithm therefore is expected to be more robust than other comparable upwind schemes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{review and}} {{critique}} of the Isgur-Paton flux tube model of hadronic physics is presented. This entails a detailed comparison with recent lattice gauge theory results which exposes both the successes and shortcomings of the model. Applications to hybrid masses, meson and hybrid meson decays, hadronic charge radii, the spin-orbit force, baryonic hybrids, and hybrid photocouplings are also discussed. Finally, I comment {{on the issue of}} adiabatic surface crossing which appears in both the flux tube model and lattice studies. FLUX TUBES The impending upgrade of CEBAF at Jefferson Lab and the advent of a new experimental facility, Hall D, devoted {{in large part to the}} exploration of the gluonic excitations of QCD make it a propitious time to review the flux tube model. The flux tube model (FTM) of Isgur and Paton is now nearly 20 years old[1] and much has been learned in <b>the</b> meantime. This <b>note</b> <b>shall</b> review <b>the</b> foundations and predictions of the FTM and compare it, where possible, to lattice gauge or other theoretical tests.

40|$|AbstractPol (1996) and Arenas (1996) {{independently}} introduced transfinite {{extensions of}} finite order of mappings {{by the use}} of the length of a partially ordered set and Borst's order, respectively.

In <b>the</b> present <b>note,</b> we <b>shall</b> show that both the transfinite extensions given by Pol and Arenas are the same if we ignore the values, and give an affirmative answer to Arenas' question as follows: a metrizable space X has the order dimension O-dim X if and only if X has large transfinite dimension Ind X.

DG]), we re-examine [...] - and {{reformulate}} when in need [...] - several basic notions in super C^∞-algebraic geometry as {{guided by the}} mathematical formulation of Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz fermionic strings and of Green-Schwarz fermionic strings {{from the viewpoint of}} Grothendieck on Algebraic Geometry. Two theorems that are the super counterpart of Theorem 3. 1. 1 and Theorem 3. 2. 1 of D(11. 3. 1) are proved. They unify the notion of "smooth maps from an Azumaya/matrix super smooth manifold with a fundamental module to a super smooth manifold" introduced in D(11. 2), making it a complete super parallel to the setting for D-branes in the realm of algebraic geometry in D(1) (arXiv: 0709. 1515 [math. AG]) and D(2) (arXiv: 0809. 2121 [math. AG]), and in the realm of differential or C^∞-algebraic geometry in D(11. 1) and D(11. 3. 1). A prototypical definition of dynamical fermionic stacked D-brane world-volume on a space-time in the same spirit of RNS fermionic strings or GS fermionic strings is thus laid down. Similar to D(11. 3. 1), which paved the path to the construction of non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action (D(13. 1) (arXiv: 1606. 08529 [hep-th])) and the standard action (D(13. 3) (arXiv: 1704. 03237 [hep-th])) for fundamental bosonic stacked D-branes, <b>the</b> current <b>notes</b> <b>shall</b> serve <b>the</b> same for the construction of supersymmetric action for fundamental fermionic stacked D-branes of various dimensions [...] - a theme of another subseries of the D-project.
