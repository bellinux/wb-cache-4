50|$|Studies by {{professor}} Brian Wansink, {{founder of the}} Cornell Food and Brand Lab have observed that people serve themselves {{in proportion to the}} plate size that they have been given. For example, while 3 ounces of pasta on a 10 inch plate look like a sizeable portion, the same amount on a 12 inch plate looks comparatively much <b>smaller.</b> <b>This</b> is <b>thought</b> to occur {{as a result of the}} Delboeuf illusion, whereby the size of the dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to over-serve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones.|$|R

40|$|Eosinophils were {{isolated}} from the mammary gland of Fasciola hepatica-infected cattle by intramammary infusion with a crude extract from adult F. hepatica. Up to 5 x 10 (9) eosinophils with a purity of over 90 % could be obtained from a single quarter of the gland. The major contaminating cells were monocytes which reached their peak several days following the eosinophil peak. Two major proteins {{were isolated}} from bovine eosinophil granules, a high molecular weight peroxidase-active protein and a smaller molecular weight predominantly basic protein. <b>This</b> <b>smaller</b> protein was <b>thought</b> to be the bovine equivalent of guinea-pig and human major basic protein (MBP), although it possessed an unusually high concentration of cysteine. The bovine MBP {{had a profound effect}} on juvenile F. hepatica in vitro causing damage and death at concentrations down to 1 x 10 (- 6) M. The damage was detected by a 51 Cr release assay and/or a viability assay involving microscopical examination of the flukes. Other cations, especially protamine sulphate, were also shown to kill flukes, although both lysozyme, found in neutrophils, and the peroxidase-positive peak from bovine eosinophils were unable to mediate any detectable damage...|$|R
