Its study provides us with ways of understanding how these changes came about. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which representations of school mathematics gradually were influenced by ideas from the Modern Mathematics movement, how these new ideas merged into local educational traditions, and how they were transformed into meaningful practice. This work is centred on the Portuguese context from the middle 1950 s to the middle 1960 s, and builds on Chervel’s notion of school culture and Gruzinski’s discussion of connected histories...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> of Brazil {{in the context}} of globalization. From a field research conducted among agents in charge of the creation and simultaneous globalization of the discourse about the existence of a “Brazilian fash- ion”, we could perceive current uses of Brasilianness in global and market terms. Such uses reveal a passage from the “mestizo” to the “diverse” as the typical characteristic of Brazilianness, a notion that is now conceived in its plural form. This conception is based on a perspective that tries to enumerate differences rather than subsume them into a single type, since the enumeration of the so-called national diversity would be the most convenient posture to adopt within the world market of symbolic goods, in which the notion of “cultural diversity” currently takes prime position...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for, and {{a case study}} <b>of,</b> the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a social <b>representation.</b> The basis <b>of</b> the thesis is derived from an understanding <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> as a complex, dynamic, pluralistic phenomena that both exist in time and draw their form and meaning from past and present knowledge(s). We are guided by an interest in understanding how one might study a social representation that is already an entrenched social phenomena and how one might go about studying such an entity in a systematic fashion over time. We devised a method through which data can be aggregated over a bound, measurable unit of time and analyzed systematically into core and peripheral systems, allowing for the study <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> long duration. Our methodology thus embeds social representations in particular historical, temporal moments {{in order to assess}} the structural formation <b>of</b> the <b>representation.</b> To assess the applicability of our methodology, we undertook a study <b>of</b> the social <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> physicians in televised medical dramas. The case of the physician was selected because of their existence as a known social phenomenon of long-duration with a prominent, continuous social presence. In our exploration of this case, we sought to answer two questions. The first asks, ‘what is the social <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> the physician as presented in televised medical dramas’, while the second queries is ‘if and how this social representation has changed over time’. We present thus not only the identification and <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>representation,</b> that <b>of</b> the physician, but we also offer a methodology with which to do so. Our methodology demonstrates that exploring representations in the past as a way to study the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> social <b>representation</b> has potential to generate new knowledge about old things. While the study of newly emerging phenomena {{presents a}}n ideal time to study social <b>representations,</b> the study <b>of</b> older <b>representations</b> offers the opportunity to better understand how knowledge is created, changed, and re-created...|$|R

The theoretical framework {{of this study is that}} <b>of</b> Moscovici’s social <b>representations</b> (1961 / 76, 1998), with reference to Flament and Abric’s work on the dynamic relation between nucleus and peripheral system (1996), which lead to various kind <b>of</b> adjustment and <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the whole <b>representation</b> or part <b>of</b> it. The methodology to address the analysis of texts is ethnographic, well-known to read social representation from judicial literature (Altheide 1996, DalLago 2002). Most acts of law considered are from the ‘emergency legislation’, produced in EU, USA, UN, Nato and Italy. Results show that terrorism cripples the perypheral system of western Law (habeas corpus, natural judge, just trial) and weakens the nucleus <b>of</b> the <b>representation</b> (from legitimate defence to humanitarian war, to preventive war) : this has a strong impact on the American loss of individual freedom in favour of social security, whilst in Europe there is a higher resistance to this crisis of liberal values.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{swirling}} around most businesses is not structure information but semi-structure information, such as spreadsheets, and documents created {{by an individual}} or company. However, in spite of success of data management of structure data by using databases, current enterprise information infrastructure is poorly suited {{for dealing with the}} continuing, rapid explosion of semi-structure data in enterprise. In this paper we discuss a system based on the integration between XML and RDB in a threetiered framework, which undertakes research at the intersection of XML and RDB, exploits their strengths in a common framework, and expands their applicability in the area of semi-structure data management. Through a discussion of the fundamental architecture in general and its components in particular, we depict the basic principles that should form the basis for the design of the architecture based on the integration of XML and RDB. The key contribution of this paper is the framework for semi-structure data management, which is orchestrated through the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation,</b> query and updating between XML data and RDB data.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{processes}} of comprehension underlying any mathematical activity we must start from the epistemological and cognitive characteristics that are specific to mathematics. The mathematical activity is based on <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> semiotic <b>representations</b> in other semiotic representations. Solving problem in a mathematical way always requires mobilizing, explicitly or implicitly, two registers <b>of</b> semiotic <b>representation.</b> We can then observe the various kinds of threshold of comprehension that block many students {{at different levels of}} the curriculum. Firstly there are two kinds <b>of</b> <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> semiotic <b>representations</b> that are quite different sources of difficulties. But one ignores or rejects the one that requires shifting the register within a representation is produced for two reasons. Either because only one kind <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> is important from a mathematical point of view, or because one believes that a multirepresentation, now obvious with computers, removes any difficulty <b>of</b> the <b>representation</b> conversion, as it is the case in other fields of knowledge. Secondly, for understanding when one learns mathematics one needs first to recognize and not to justify. The ability to solve problems, to explore them in a mathematical way, to anticipate possible treatments, to check by oneself the validity of a procedure is basically the ability to recognize the same object in two different representations or different objects in almost similar representations. This ability requires a coordination of various registers separated by cognitive gaps. The conceptualization in mathematics emerges only from this coordination. We take several examples to give an insight both of the specific problems of comprehension in learning mathematics and of the cognitive way of analyzing them. And we highlight the need of an explicit and global cognitive approach in mathematics education so that learning mathematics means for all students to develop their ability to think, to see, to imagine and to organize information...|$|R
