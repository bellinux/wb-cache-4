50|$|LMA {{receives}} electrical power, cooling, {{and heating}} from a <b>trigeneration</b> (CCHP) facility, the Medical Area Total Energy Plant (MATEP).|$|E
50|$|In 2013, the {{extensive}} foreign project in Sydney, was completed, where TEDOM built two <b>trigeneration</b> centres {{with a total}} electrical output of 11.8MW.|$|E
50|$|A plant {{producing}} electricity, {{heat and}} cold {{is called a}} <b>trigeneration</b> or polygeneration plant. Cogeneration systems linked to absorption chillers use waste heat for refrigeration.|$|E
50|$|Aalst Chocolate {{utilizes}} a <b>Trigeneration</b> System {{in their}} chocolate production, which reduces greenhouse gases emission of a combined total 4.9 million {{standard cubic feet}} a year.|$|E
50|$|TEDOM offers CHP {{units in}} three product series: MICRO (up to 50 kW), CENTO (up to 500 kW), QUANTO (up to 10 MW). The {{products}} {{of each individual}} line are manufactured in two basic configurations: with an operation frequency of 50 Hertz (intended mostly for the European market) or 60 Hertz (intended mostly for the American market). Aside from natural gas, most of the CHP units are also capable of operating on biogas, landfill gas, or mine gas. The company offers CHP units in several versions depending on which environment the unit must operate in: a version without a sound enclosure (for installation into sound-proof areas), with a sound enclosure (for indoor installations), and a container version (for outdoor installations).CHP units {{are closely related to}} <b>trigeneration</b> units, but in addition to power and heat, the <b>trigeneration</b> units also produce cold energy. TEDOM included the <b>trigeneration</b> units in its portfolio as well.|$|E
50|$|Most {{industrial}} countries generate {{the majority of}} their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output. These plants have excellent economies of scale, but usually transmit electricity long distances resulting in sizable losses, negatively affect the environment. Large power plants can use cogeneration or <b>trigeneration</b> systems only when sufficient need exists in immediate geographic vicinity for an industrial complex, additional power plant or a city. An example of cogeneration with <b>trigeneration</b> applications in a major city is the New York City steam system.|$|E
5000|$|Heat output {{may be used}} {{also for}} cooling (for example in Summer), thanks to an {{absorption}} chiller.If cooling is achieved in the same time, Thermal efficiency in a <b>trigeneration</b> system is defined as: ...|$|E
5000|$|Cogeneration {{delivers}} the joint products {{of heat and}} power; <b>trigeneration</b> provides cold, heat and power. With extraction steam turbines, cogeneration has variable proportions; with an internal combustion engine the proportions of heat and power are fixed.|$|E
50|$|The {{supply of}} {{high-temperature}} heat first drives a gas or steam turbine-powered generator. The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating. At smaller scales (typically below 1 MW) a gas engine or diesel engine may be used. <b>Trigeneration</b> differs from cogeneration {{in that the}} waste heat is used for both heating and cooling, typically in an absorption refrigerator. CCHP systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants. In the United States, the application of <b>trigeneration</b> in buildings is called building cooling, heating and power (BCHP). Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction.|$|E
50|$|Cogeneration has its {{greatest}} benefits when scaled to fit buildings or complexes of buildings where electricity, {{heating and cooling}} are perpetually needed. Such installations include {{but are not limited}} to: data centers, manufacturing facilities, universities, hospitals, military complexes, and schools. Localized <b>trigeneration</b> has addition benefits as described by distributed generation. Redundancy of power in mission critical applications, lower power usage costs and the ability to sell electrical power back to the local utility {{are a few of the}} major benefits. Even for small buildings such as individual family homes <b>trigeneration</b> systems provide benefits over cogeneration because of increased energy utilization. This increased efficiency can also provide significant reduced greenhouse gas emissions, particularly for new communities.|$|E
50|$|At {{the first}} level, decentralised energy master plans, <b>trigeneration,</b> {{renewable}} energy and Advanced Waste Treatment, Decentralised Water and Automated Waste Master Plans {{are being developed}} to create a city-wide green infrastructure plan which will be embedded into the City’s master plan and operations.|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, the {{combination}} of the SOFC and gas turbine can give result in high overall (electrical and thermal) efficiency. Further combination of the SOFC-GT in a combined cooling, heat and power (or <b>trigeneration)</b> configuration (via HVAC) also has the potential to yield even higher thermal efficiencies in some cases.|$|E
50|$|Following {{completion}} of the two-year-long procurement process Cogent Energy (owned by Origin Energy) was appointed by Sydney as the energy services provider to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the city-wide <b>trigeneration</b> network. Heads of agreement were signed in April 2012 and the development agreement was executed in August 2012.|$|E
50|$|From 2008 to 2009 Jones {{worked as}} an energy and climate change {{consultant}} both in the UK and overseas, including working for the City of Sydney {{on a number of}} energy and climate change projects and advising on the delivery of the climate change targets in Sustainable Sydney 2030, in particular on <b>trigeneration</b> and other green infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|Cogeneration or {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) {{is the use}} of a heat engine or power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time. <b>Trigeneration</b> or combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector.|$|E
50|$|Under Moore's leadership, {{the city}} of Sydney is aiming to reduce carbon {{emissions}} 70 per cent by 2030. It has installed bicycle lanes; upgraded its car fleet to hybrids; planted 10,000 trees; provided 600 on-street car-share spaces; installed Sydney's largest building-based solar photovoltaic system; installed water harvesting in 11 major parks and voted to install two new <b>trigeneration</b> plants.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} a hybrid energy system is a {{photovoltaic}} array coupled with a wind turbine. This would create more output from the wind turbine during the winter, whereas during the summer, the solar panels would produce their peak output. Hybrid energy systems often yield greater economic and environmental returns than wind, solar, geothermal or <b>trigeneration</b> stand-alone systems by themselves.|$|E

It is more than twice as efficient as conventional grid electricity and helped the development gain BREEAM sustainable community status.

50|$|The RDF-Powerstation is {{directly}} integrated {{in a building}} like a business centre and {{is used as a}} cogeneration or <b>trigeneration</b> plant. Due to that the incineration unit and all additional components, which are necessary for the operation of the plant and the utilization of the energy, are located in the consumers’ area. So the energy is produced and used at the same place. The technical realization of this concept is based on the configuration of the process diagram.|$|E
50|$|Waste of the {{by-product}} heat {{is reduced}} if a cogeneration system is used, {{also known as}} a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Limitations to the use of by-product heat arise primarily from the engineering cost/efficiency challenges in effectively exploiting small temperature differences to generate other forms of energy. Applications utilizing waste heat include swimming pool heating and paper mills. In some cases, cooling can also be produced by the use of absorption refrigerators for example, in this case it's called <b>trigeneration</b> or CCHP (combined cooling, heat and power).|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Jones was {{appointed}} as chief development officer, energy {{and climate change}} by the City of Sydney to provide leadership, strategic direction and high level advocacy to promote the changes which support the development and delivery of green infrastructure within the City {{as set out in}} Sustainable Sydney 2030. Sydney has an ambitious target to reduce CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030 from 2006 levels which will require at least 330 MWe of combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) or <b>trigeneration</b> to deliver 70% of the city’s electricity requirements by 2030 with the remainder coming from local renewable energy.|$|E
50|$|Steam {{for heating}} is {{inherently}} fuel efficient; boiler efficiencies approach 90%. Approximately 30% of the ConEd steam system’s installed capacity and 50% {{of the annual}} steam generated comes from cogeneration. Cogeneration and Heat Recovery Steam Generation (HRSG) significantly increase the fuel efficiency of cogenerated electricity and thereby reduces the emission of pollutants, such as NOx, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter, and reduce the city's carbon footprint. Con Edison is promoting the use of steam for cooling in the summer months, {{something that can be}} accomplished with the installation of absorption chillers. Such <b>trigeneration</b> systems result in additional energy and pollution savings, while reducing peak electrical loads.|$|E
50|$|The product {{portfolio}} consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines {{have the capability to}} start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and <b>trigeneration</b> for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.|$|E
5000|$|Changes in the New South Wales {{political}} climate meant {{the state government}} was granted approval authority over local councils for developments deemed [...] "state significant projects". Therefore, in 2009 it was the state government of New South Wales that provided approval of an enhanced master scheme of Central Park that was put forth by London based architectural firm Foster and Partners. Foster and Partners along with Paris based firm Ateliers Jean Nouvel and Sydney based firm PTW Architects collaborated to form the Central Park project's architectural team. The new master scheme included a larger floor area, additional open space, <b>trigeneration</b> as well as provisions to ensure the project's buildings could achieve a 5 star green star rating.|$|E
50|$|Central Park is {{projected}} to utilise its own low-carbon natural gas power plant, which shall allow for thermal energy to be produced for both residents and employees. The first stage of this measure involves a two megawatt tri generation energy plant which, when completed in November 2015, will run on natural gas and {{have the capacity to}} produce carbon thermal energy, heating and cooling for 3000 residences and 65,000 square metres of retail and commercial space. Tri generation is believed to be twice as efficient as coal fired power plants and it is forecasted that Central Parks’ <b>trigeneration</b> energy plant could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 190,000 tonnes over the 25-year design life of the plant.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his time}} at Woking, Jones reduced CO2 {{emissions}} by 77.5% from 1990 levels to 2004, improved the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock within its area by 30% from 1996 to 2004 and undertook groundbreaking work on energy and water efficiency, private wire CHP cogeneration and <b>trigeneration</b> decentralised energy systems, environmentally friendly waste recycling/recovery and energy from waste technologies, alternative fuels for transport, renewable energy and fuel cells. Under Jones, Woking installed 81 private wire decentralised energy systems, nearly 10% of the UK’s total installed solar energy photovoltaics and the first fuel cell CHP in the UK. Woking was able to implement private wire networks under the UK’s exempt licensing regime [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{viability}} of CHP (sometimes termed utilisation factor), especially in smaller CHP installations, {{depends on a}} good baseload of operation, {{both in terms of}} an on-site (or near site) electrical demand and heat demand. In practice, an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat (heat driven operation) or be run as a power plant with some use of its waste heat, the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency. The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for <b>Trigeneration</b> exist. In such cases, the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an absorption chiller.|$|E
5000|$|Santos Place was {{designed}} by Donovan Hill Architect, and constructed by Hutchinson Builders (in a Design & Construct procurement method). The {{total cost of the}} building's construction is A$270 million and it provides 33 000 m2 of floor area. Santos Place is Australia's largest building to receive a 6 star green building design rating. [...] It features energy efficiency measures such as [...] "high performance double glazing, substantial external sun shading, state of the art ventilation and an energy-efficient gas-powered <b>trigeneration</b> system". [...] Sensored lighting switches off automatically if no movement is detected after five minutes. Rainwater is collected on the roof and stored in tanks {{on the top of the}} building. Construction of the building was done with 20% recycled concrete and 90% recycled steel. It includes a two-level gymnasium and 280 secured basement bicycle parks.|$|E
5000|$|The Carnot {{method is}} an {{allocation}} procedure for dividing up fuel input (primary energy, end energy) in joint production processes that generate {{two or more}} energy products in one process (e.g. cogeneration or <b>trigeneration).</b> It is also suited to allocate other streams such as CO2-emissions or variable costs. The potential to generate mechanical or electrical work (exergy) is used as the distribution key. For heat this potential can be assessed the Carnot efficiency. Thus, the Carnot method {{is a form of}} an exergetic allocation method. It uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis. The main application area of this method is cogeneration, {{but it can also be}} applied to other processes generating a joint products, such as a chiller generating cold and producing waste heat which could be used for low temperature heat demand. The Carnot method's advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams; only endogenous process parameters are needed. Thus, the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a transient computer {{model of a}} <b>trigeneration</b> system using TRNSYS software. This simulation model can accurately reproduce the results from a real world experiment of a <b>trigeneration</b> system conducted over five days. This model is then applied to an entire cooling season to show the primary energy usage of a <b>trigeneration</b> system using an adsorption chiller to meet the cooling load. These results can then {{be compared to the}} primary energy usage of a residence with a traditional grid-powered Vapor Compression System (VCS) air conditioner. In order to evaluate the geographic feasibility of this <b>trigeneration</b> system, four different cities were selected for analysis. The chosen cities had various climate conditions to aid in comparison. An analysis was performed on the primary energy usage, environmental impact, and economic cost of the <b>trigeneration</b> system to demonstrate the feasibility and likely implementation of one form of <b>trigeneration</b> technology...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{feasibility}} of using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in <b>trigeneration</b> plants is examined through thermodynamic modeling and thermoeconomic optimization. Three novel <b>trigeneration</b> systems are considered. Each one of these systems consists of an ORC, a heating-process heat exchanger, and a single-effect absorption chiller. The three systems are distinguished by {{the source of the}} heat input to the ORC. The systems considered are SOFC-trigeneration, biomass- <b>trigeneration,</b> and solar-trigeneration systems. For each system four cases are considered: electrical-power, cooling-cogeneration, heating-cogeneration, and <b>trigeneration</b> cases. Comprehensive thermodynamic analysis on each system is carried out. Furthermore, thermoeconomic optimization is conducted. The objective of the thermoeconomic optimization is to minimize the cost per exergy unit of the <b>trigeneration</b> product. The results of the thermoeconomic optimization are used to compare the three systems through thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analyses. This study illustrates key output parameters to assess the <b>trigeneration</b> systems considered. These parameters are energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, net electrical power, electrical to cooling ratio, and electrical to heating ratio. Moreover, exergy destruction modeling is conducted to identify and quantify the major sources of exergy destruction in the systems considered. In addition, an environmental impact assessment is conducted to quantify the amount of CO 2 emissions in the systems considered. Furthermore, this study examines both the cost rate and cost per exergy unit of the electrical power and other <b>trigeneration</b> products. This study reveals that there is a considerable efficiency improvement when <b>trigeneration</b> is used, as compared to only electrical power production. In addition, the emissions of CO 2 per MWh of <b>trigeneration</b> are significantly lower than that of electrical power. It was shown that the exergy destruction rates of the ORC evaporators for the three systems are quite high. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} using more efficient ORC evaporators in <b>trigeneration</b> plants. In addition, this study reveals that the SOFC-trigeneration system has the highest electrical energy efficiency while the biomass-trigeneration system and the solar mode of the solar <b>trigeneration</b> system have the highest <b>trigeneration</b> energy efficiencies. In contrast, the SOFC-trigeneration system has the highest exergy efficiency for both electrical and <b>trigeneration</b> cases. Furthermore, the thermoeconomic optimization shows that the solar-trigeneration system has the lowest cost per exergy unit. Meanwhile the solar-trigeneration system has zero CO 2 emissions and depends on a free renewable energy source. Therefore, it can be concluded that the solar-trigeneration system has the best thermoeconomic performance among the three systems considered...|$|E

This paper presents a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model (FMCDM) for <b>trigeneration</b> systems selection and evaluation. The multi-criteria decision-making methods are briefly reviewed combining the general decision-making process. Then the fuzzy set theory, weighting method and the FMCDM model are presented. Finally, several kinds of <b>trigeneration</b> systems, whose dynamical sources are, respectively stirling engine, gas turbine, gas engine and solid oxide fuel cell, are compared and evaluated with a separate generation system. The case for selecting the optimal <b>trigeneration</b> system applied to a residential building is assessed from the technical, economical, environmental and social aspects, and the FMCDM model combining analytic hierarchical process is applied to the <b>trigeneration</b> case to demonstrate the decision-making process and effectiveness of proposed model.
