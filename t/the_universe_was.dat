5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> about one second old.|$|E

5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang (the quark epoch), <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
40|$|The last 2, 500 {{years have}} been {{dominated}} by the belief, expressed in different forms, that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> lawful, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> a knowable system governed by rules which determine the future uniquely and completely. An extreme way to express this belief is to claim overconfidently {{that the study of}} some branches of science will soon be completed, will soon attend an end. Our aim is to challenge this apocryphal hypothesis by arguing, with complexity-theoretic arguments, that <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> lawless, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> lacking any kind of general ordered structure implied by the term "law"...|$|R

40|$|It seems {{improbable}} {{that life}} would {{exist in a}} naturalistic <b>universe.</b> But if <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>were</b> spatially infinite, then seemingly improbable events {{would be expected to}} happen; life would be expected to exist. It follows that the existence of life provides evidence that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> spatially infinite. Is <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> spatially infinite or spatially finite? Are there an infinite number of stars and planets, or only a finite number? I will argue that the very existence of life provides evidence for the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> spatially infinite, with an infinite number of stars and planets. (For short, I will call this hypothesis the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> infinite. ...|$|R
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{observable}} <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same in all directions as observed from Earth. <b>The</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that <b>the</b> large-scale <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A <b>Universe</b> that <b>is</b> both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|R
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized {{to account for the}} asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, when <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 EP Instant 0 in <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked {{a return to}} their earlier, harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings. Both {{the name of the}} group and the title of the album are references to the work of Greek-French intellectual Cornelius Castoriadis.|$|E
5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> that cannot <b>be</b> seen. Because of the {{gravitational}} effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> dark matter. <b>The</b> spatial distribution of dark matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|R
5000|$|Craig {{concludes that}} the cause of the {{existence}} of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> an [...] "uncaused, personal Creator ... who sans <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.|$|R
5|$|The {{ultimate}} fate of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> still unknown, {{because it}} depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>were</b> sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout <b>is</b> positive and <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly {{starting a new}} Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>were</b> insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>is</b> not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> appears to <b>be</b> flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|R
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets.

More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E

5000|$|The {{beliefs on}} <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> {{speculation}} about the infinite or the limited nature of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> There <b>are</b> four ways these beliefs were expressed: ...|$|R

5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid.
