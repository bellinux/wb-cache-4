5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in 1950, silencing skeptics who thought the team stood out {{only because of the}} poor quality of competition in the AAFC. After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in {{the first game of the}} season, the Browns advanced to the championship game, where <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Rams 30–28 on a last-second Lou Groza field goal. Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL's first-ever Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During the offseason, the Rockets {{went for}} a change of visual identity, making navy blue and silver the new primary colors while {{adopting}} a new cartoon-inspired logo and pinstriped jerseys. The Rockets won 48 games in the 1995–96 campaign, in which Olajuwon became the NBA's all-time leader in blocked shots. <b>They</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Lakers {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, but were swept by the eventual Western Conference Champions Seattle SuperSonics in the second round.|$|E

The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach {{acquired}} two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, {{and defensive}} center Bill Russell. Powered by these new recruits, the Celtics went 44–28 {{in the regular}} season, and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award. The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E

At the first game <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> later champion Omonia, 2–1, in an away game at Makario Stadium in Nicosia. This defeat was the first Omonia suffered at the stadium since they began competing in it. Nea Salamina finished seventh for the season.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} {{progress}} through four rounds {{to reach the}} final. Matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Liverpool's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. <b>They</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> previous season's runners-up Saint-Étienne by a single goal over two legs, while they defeated FC Zürich 6–1 on aggregate in the semi-final. Borussia Mönchengladbach's route to the final was more difficult; {{all but one of}} their ties were won by a margin of just one goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, as a Second Division side, Sunderland {{reached the}} FA Cup Final, where <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> cup-holders Leeds United. A first half goal by Scotsman Ian Porterfield {{was the only}} goal of the game. Jimmy Montgomery {{produced}} a double save, first from a Trevor Cherry header, and then from a shot by Peter Lorimer, to prevent Leeds from scoring. At {{the end of the}} game Sunderland manager Stokoe ran onto the pitch to embrace his goalkeeper, a gesture perpetuated by the statue currently standing outside the Stadium of Light. Only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have since equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.|$|E

5|$|In March 1967, Dougan {{dropped into}} the Second Division after being signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Ronnie Allen for a £50,000 fee. He marked his home debut on 25 March by scoring a hat-trick against Hull City. He ended the 1966–67 season with nine goals in 11 games for Wolves, and helped the club to secure {{promotion}} to the First Division. He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the Los Angeles Wolves in the United Soccer Association, scoring three goals in eleven games to help Wolves to win the West Division title and then captained the side and scored a goal as <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Washington Whips 6–5 in the USA Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{qualified}} for {{the playoffs for the}} third consecutive season.

They began the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 15 against the Philadelphia Flyers. <b>They</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Flyers, Washington Capitals, and Carolina Hurricanes to earn a second-straight berth in the Stanley Cup Final. In the Finals, the Penguins defeated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games in a rematch of the previous season's Stanley Cup Final to win the franchise's third league title.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, McCarty {{joined the}} senior team at St. Thomas More, skipping the junior team entirely. He continued {{in his role}} as a running back while switching to the secondary defensively. Despite being a rare Grade 9 player on the senior team, {{he was one of the}} Knights' two leading rushers that year. McCarty scored a touchdown in the AAA B.C. championship game, helping the Knights win their first senior title as <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Pinetree T-Wolves 29–6. While K.C. Steele, the Knights' coach, has a policy of not recording player statistics, it is estimated that McCarty finished 1999 with over 1,000 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland's games {{consisted}} of local competitions and the FA Cup. Additionally, {{they participated in}} friendlies with Football League clubs; <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> League champions Preston North End on 28 April 1889. As their popularity grew, they applied for admission into the Football League. At the League's annual meeting that considered this application, Sunderland offered to pay towards other clubs' travelling costs, {{to compensate for the}} extra distance these club would need to travel. This offer secured their place in the Football League. They replaced Stoke, one of the original League founding members, who failed to be re-elected. In their second season in the Football League, Sunderland won the title, by five points over Preston North End. This success was repeated in the following season, when Sunderland won their second League title, this time 11 points ahead of their nearest contenders. That season also included an 8–1 win over West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|The French won {{a further}} five {{successive}} tournaments {{before they were}} beaten 3–2 by Great Britain in 1933. Australia were the last champions {{before the onset of}} the Second World War. <b>They</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> United States 3–2 in 1939. Upon resumption of the tournament in 1946, it was renamed the Davis Cup after the death of Dwight D. Davis in 1945. The United States regained the title after they beat Australia 5–0. They retained the title until 1950 when Australia won 4–1. This marked the start of Australian dominance of the Davis Cup, as they only lost three times from 1950 to 1967. Prior to 1972, the champion received a bye directly to the final. This was changed so that the champion had to play in every round.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{began the}} 20th century as champions but the gap that {{distinguished}} {{them from their}} competitors was diminishing. Football in England was becoming more competitive as more teams formed. Villa did remain a significant force in the game though. Despite a run of four victories {{at the start of}} the 1900–01 season, Villa finished fourth from bottom. In the 1902–03 season Villa won 12 of their last 15 games to finish only one point behind champions Sheffield Wednesday. In 1905, Villa won the FA Cup with a then record crowd of 101,117 watching the match at Crystal Palace, where Villa beat Newcastle United 2–0. In the same season, Villa finished fourth and this helped to boost the coffers at the club. After the success of 1905, Villa went through a barren patch and it was not until the 1909–10 season that Villa threatened to regain the title. In that season, <b>they</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> reigning champions Manchester United 7–1. Villa won the championship for the first time in 10 years to take a then record, sixth title. The 1910–11 season was very close and the title was decided on the last day of the season when Villa lost to Liverpool and Manchester United beat Sunderland to take the title. The following season, Villa finished sixth. Yet in 1913, Villa won the FA Cup for a then record-equalling fifth time. By the end of what was to be called Villa's golden era, when the First World War began, the club had won the League Championship six times and the FA Cup five times. This included the League and Cup Double in 1896–97, a feat which would not be repeated for more than 60 years.|$|E
