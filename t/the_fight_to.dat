5|$|Du Bois {{used his}} {{influential}} {{role in the}} NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film The Birth of a Nation premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful. The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate bayonet and musket battle followed. Women and {{children}} fled the fight into the river, where many drowned immediately. The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> a willow island, which was being peppered with canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson looking {{to close the}} {{distance}} early. Jackson immediately went for a double-leg takedown, and picked Silva up. Silva then locked his legs, creating a standing closed guard, and applied a guillotine choke. The two stayed in this position until Jackson loosened his own grip, taking <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> the ground for the first time, with Silva holding onto the chokehold.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} Schmitt {{established}} radio {{communication with the}} 1st Battalion, 9th infantry. When daylight came Schmitt and his group {{saw that they were}} surrounded by North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was eager to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing was to take <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E

5|$|This {{campaign}} {{starts as}} Yodit attempts to flee from her nephew Gidajan, who has framed her for theft. She then seeks {{the hand of}} the Syrian prince Zanobis in marriage and performs several deeds to increase her reputation, having to deal with the Beja tribes, Nobatia, and the Ikshids. Then she defends the pass of Darginda from the army of Dagnajan, the king of Aksum, and his allies, the Begemder, while also dealing with Alodians and Orthodox monks, killing the king before he makes it through the mountain pass. Following this, she takes <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> Gidajan and takes control of several stelae in the region surrounding the city of Massawa before taking the city itself. She pursues her nephew to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942, Bladin's {{strength}} in NWA consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly Bristol Beaufighter and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, Lockheed Hudson light bombers, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies B-25 Mitchell medium bombers and USAAF B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. As Japanese air raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland, and his fighters {{close to the}} coast where they could intercept the raiders. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1January 1943, he stepped up offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the Timor and Arafura Seas as the Allies took <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese. He often employed his own judgement {{in the selection of}} targets, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming. On 27February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield, near Koepang on Timor, that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Paul Allen pledged {{at least}} $100million toward <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> end the Ebola virus {{epidemic}} in West Africa, {{making him the}} largest private donor in the Ebola crisis. He also created a website called TackleEbola.org {{as a way to}} spread awareness as well as serve as a way donors can fund projects in need. The site additionally highlights organizations working to stop Ebola that Allen supports such as International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières, Partners in Health, UNICEF and World Food Program USA. On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action and support to bring the number of Ebola cases down to zero. As part of his ongoing commitment to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Paul Allen Foundation partnered with the United States Department of State and MRIGlobal to develop a new first of its kind medevac biocontainment units. These units will be used by the U.S. State Department to help safely evacuate healthcare workers who might fall ill to infectious diseases such as Ebola.|$|E
