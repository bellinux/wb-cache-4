500|$|David L.G. Arnold {{comments}} in the book Leaving Springfield that the episode is a satire on [...] "society's lazy, uninformed attitude about the electoral process", as well as [...] "a comment on the role in society of a cadre of elites (the Republican party) who see themselves as naturally suited to lead". The episode also portrays Republicans as willing {{to break the law}} in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob's line: [...] "Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king. That's why I did this: <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you</b> from yourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1994 Anime America convention, Nagai {{talked about}} the {{contrast}} between Honey and the dark Cosplay City: [...] "I thought... well, what would Honey-chan do if she appeared in a dark futuristic city like in BATMAN. In the movie BATMAN, everything is dark. Dark background and dark characters. However, {{in the case of}} Honey-chan, she’s super cheerful and sunny. She really stands out due to the dark background." [...] He believed that New Cutie Honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters' expositions, and that Honey instead [...] "makes her own moves, and she carries the whole story". On the relative weakness of male characters in the series, he said, [...] "Honey-chan is like a mother, and she loves to protect weak men. Their existence is her reason to live, like oh, 'I have to fight <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Angel" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and Steve Bray and {{released}} worldwide on April 10, 1985. The song first began as a demo and was recorded as early as April 1984 for her second studio album, Like a Virgin. However, the whole project was held off, much to Madonna's frustration, by the continuing sales of her self-titled debut album, which had by then sold over a million copies in United States. She had decided to release [...] "Angel" [...] as the initial single from the album, but changed her mind, after the recording of the title track [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was complete. [...] "Angel" [...] was an ode to [...] "a heavenly love" [...] and inspired from Madonna's Catholic upbringing with the singer saying, [...] "I think it's important to call angels to you <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you...</b> That's part of the ritualistic moment. The calling of angels." [...] The track was ultimately released as the third single, and included the song [...] "Into the Groove", from Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan, on the B-side of the 12-inch maxi-single.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} verdict was issued, [...] a group of professors at al-Azhar University, the [...] "theological centre of Egypt", issued a joint {{statement}} calling for Abu Zayd's execution. [...] The Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization (which assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981 and was engaged in a guerrilla war with the government at the time) {{issued a statement saying}} the professor should be killed for abandoning [...] his Muslim faith. But calls for his death were not limited to insurgents. Even a newspaper published by the ruling political party of the ostensibly secular anti-fundamentalist regime, The Islamic Banner, [...] declared that `execution` was a fitting penalty if Abu Zayd failed to repent. In addition Abu Zayd received threats in the mail, one promising [...] "No matter how much the police tries <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you,</b> you will not get away.".|$|E

2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>you.</b> If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious.
