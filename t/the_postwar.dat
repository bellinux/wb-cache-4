5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts. Brundage, who applied for a commission in the Army Ordnance Corps but was rejected, in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period {{became a member of}} the Construction Division Association, composed of men who had built facilities for the military, and later became its president from 1926 to 1928.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{stabilization}} of the unemployment rate-between the pre- 1930 and post- 1948 eras is an artifact of improvements in data collection procedures. Prewar methods are used to construct postwar unemployment data {{that are consistent with}} the historical data. <b>The</b> constructed <b>postwar</b> series is nearly as volatile as the pre- 1930 unemployment data. <b>The</b> constructed <b>postwar</b> data are systematically more volatile than <b>the</b> actual <b>postwar</b> data because <b>the</b> cyclical behavior of the labor force and productivity are misspecified in the construction procedures. The relationship between the actual and constructed postwar unemployment series is used to construct new historical data. ...|$|R
5|$|In August 1944 General Leslie Groves, {{director}} of the Manhattan Project, appointed Smyth to <b>the</b> <b>Postwar</b> Policy Committee, which was charged with proposing government policy {{for research and development}} of atomic energy after the war was over. The committee recommended that a national commission modeled on the OSRD fund and oversee continued production and fundamental research in government laboratories, universities, and the private sector.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> era, the 509th Composite Group {{was one of}} the {{original}} ten bombardment groups assigned to Strategic Air Command on 21 March 1946 and the only one equipped with Silverplate B-29 Superfortress aircraft capable of delivering atomic bombs. It was standardized as a bombardment group and redesignated the 509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy, on 10 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period, De Soto {{continued}} {{to serve with}} the Navy, mostly in South American waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. She caught fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>postwar</b> {{communist}} regime developed {{the city as}} an industrial and commercial centre. It was elevated {{to the status of}} a museum town, as it was the birthplace of the leader of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Enver Hoxha, who had been born there in 1908. His house was converted into a museum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>postwar</b> period saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage}} of labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, and resolved jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.|$|E
5|$|The volume {{continues}} briefly through <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period, where harsh experiences persisted {{even after}} slavery ended. For example, Black Codes apprenticeship laws were {{a means for}} former slaveowners to own the labor of the formerly enslaved children.

5|$|William Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who {{had fought}} in the war, freed his slave Prince Whipple because of revolutionary ideals.

5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> {{decline of}} variety and music hall and {{increased}} competition from cinema and television, the theatre went into decline and was closed on 31 January 1955.

5|$|After leaving office, Voorhis {{remained}} in his Alexandria, Virginia, house, completing his book, Confessions of a Congressman. In early 1947, {{he was offered}} the job of {{executive director of the}} Cooperative League of the USA. The Voorhis family relocated to Winnetka, Illinois, near the League's Chicago headquarters. The League, which included both consumer and producer cooperatives, had fallen on hard times in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period. Under his leadership, the League's financial position gradually improved and some major cooperatives that had remained aloof from the League were persuaded to join. The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E

5|$|After {{the work}} was completed, Lacroma {{underwent}} sea trials beginning on 9 July 1906. She was thereafter assigned to her role as the yacht for the Marinekommandant, at that time Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. The ship saw no significant service during World War I. In 1915, Lacroma was completely disarmed and thereafter used as a barracks ship for German U-boat crews in Pola starting in 1916. After Austria-Hungary's defeat in November 1918, was {{handed over to the}} new Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1918. In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> division of war prizes, the ship was awarded to Italy, where she was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> era {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters {{in the late}} 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
