When Steve {{questions}} him on {{why he is}} cleaning it, Roger reveals he is using {{it in order to}} have sex with Snot. At the Wild West Land amusement park, Steve spills the news to Snot, showing the stress ball as proof. Devastated, Snot ends his relationship with Roger, which upsets Roger as well. Steve brings back up his original 31 flavors idea, but Snot still remains depressed from his broken relationship. Steve devises another idea to get him and Roger back together. In his Jenny disguise, Roger meets Snot again and apologizes for his past actions, and Snot accepts him back into their relationship again, at least until Roger gets hit and killed by a bus, much to Snot's depression once again until Steve tells Snot he has gotten closer to having sex with someone <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group has ever been. Roger shows up again at the scene in another disguise and tells Steve that he faked his death, explaining his ability to move very fast as he sets up a decoy of his Jenny persona right before the bus hits it.|$|E

500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

500|$|In May 1963, The Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham {{as their}} manager; {{he was a}} former {{publicist}} who had been directed to the band by his previous clients, the Beatles. Because Oldham was only nineteen and had not reached the age of majority—he was also younger <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band—he could not get an agent's licence nor sign any contracts without his mother also signing. By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton in order to secure record financing and assistance booking venues. Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted. Initially, Oldham tried to apply the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager: making the band members wear suits. Later, he changed his mind and imagined a band which contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, an unclean appearance. He later said he wanted to make the Stones [...] "a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables" [...] and to [...] "establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic". Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist. On Stewart's decision, Oldham later said [...] "Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [...] to remember the faces in the picture." [...] Later, Oldham reduced the ages of the band members in publicity to make them appear as teenagers.|$|E
500|$|The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, {{headquartered}} in Chicago, hired Haynes as their field superintendent in 1890 after the company's {{board of directors}} [...] "discovered that Elwood Haynes knew more about natural gas <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state". He and his wife moved to Greentown where he oversaw {{the construction of the}} company's first pumping wells. The company planned to construct a natural gas line from eastern Indiana to Chicago, a distance of over , which would be the first long-distance natural gas pipeline built in the United States. Haynes supervised the design and construction phases of the project. Because of the length of the line and the temperature changes between the two points, moisture in the natural gas condensed on the pipe, and during colder times would freeze the pipes in some locations. The problem was a significant setback to the operation, which had to stop pumping during the winter months. Haynes solved the problem by creating a refrigeration device that would cause the moisture (which was a diluted form of gasoline) to condense, freeze, and fall into a reservoir. These devices were installed between the main lines and pumping stations and effectively removed all the moisture from the natural gas before it was pumped into the lines. This prevented water buildup in the pipes and allowed the pipes to be used year round. The concept was a significant advance in early refrigeration technology and was further developed by others in later years.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
