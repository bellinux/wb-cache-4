40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Timothy Shedd and Gregory Nellis; 118 pp. Two test facilities were used to study the characteristics and method of spray cooling. Spray cooling {{is a process that}} delivers liquid droplets from an atomizer to a surface that is hotter than the saturation temperature of the fluid. The droplets impact the surface and spread, causing a thin liquid film to form. This liquid film is capable of removing large heat loads from the surface. Ten nozzle designs were tested, including arrays of between 1 and 16 nozzles. Each nozzle design was tested at a minimum of 4 flow rates. The emphasis {{of this study is to}} investigate the behavior of the film on the die surface to determine ways to improve on spray cooling designs for future designs. The first test facility used to investigate the limits and abilities of the nozzles was a heat <b>transfer</b> <b>stand.</b> Measurements of the applied heat load of each die and the junction tempera- tures at 8 locations per die were taken. Measurements were also recorded for the conditions of the fluid being delivered to the die. From these, values of critical heat fluxes, heat trans- fer coefficients, and surface temperature distributions were obtained. The measured critical heat fluxes of the nozzle designs that were tested ranged from 8. 5 to 75. 7 W/cm 2. Local heat transfer coefficients ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 4 W/cm 2 ? K. Another heat transfer related property that was investigated was the efficiency of the design. The efficiency was defined as the critical heat flux divided by the sum of the available latent and sensible heat capacities of the fluid. Experimental results showed that nozzle designs with lower efficiencies could reach higher levels of critical heat flux and had more desirable heat transfer coefficients. Efficiencies at critical heat flux were calculated to be between 0. 17 and 0. 35. Lower values of efficiency mean that the system is less reliant on the two-phase component of heat transfer. Designs that are capable of removing heat with-out surface nucleate boiling were found to perform better. A visualization test stand was also designed and constructed for the visualization por- tion of the study. A 2000 ?A thick coating of indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass die created a transparent, resistive heating element. Measurements of the film thickness under adia- batic conditions were taken using an optical technique based on the angle of total internal reflection. Experimental film thicknesses were measured to be 42 - 918 ?m. A numerical model was developed to predict the film thicknesses; values predicted were 79 - 280 ?m. The results of these two tests were correlated to understand how the spray distribution and patternization effects the heat transfer characteristics.

Using Onsager's reciprocity relations we prove that spin pumping and spin-transfer torques are two fundamentally equivalent dynamic processes in magnetic structures with itinerant electrons. We review {{the theory of}} the coupled motion of the magnetization order parameter and electron for textured bulk ferromagnets (e. g. containing domain walls) and heterostructures (such as spin valves). We present first-principles calculations for the material-dependent damping parameters of magnetic alloys. Theoretical and experimental results agree in general well.

After accounting for taxes and transfers the poverty rates for the same year became 6%, 7.5%, 5.7%, 7.7%, and 9.7% respectively, for an average reduction of 18.7 p.p. Compared to the US, which has a poverty level pre-tax of 28.3% and post-tax of 17.4% for a reduction of 10.9 p.p., the effects of tax and transfers on poverty in all the Nordic countries are substantially bigger. In comparison to France (27 p.p. reduction) and Germany (24.2 p.p. reduction), however, the taxes and transfers in the Nordic countries are smaller on average.|$|R

The procedure is less extensive and provides a direct “orthodromic” line of pull with good muscular excursion and power.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{international}} trade literature {{has focused on the}} effects of exporting and its benefits in an open economy. Scholars note that engaging in trade enhances knowledge spillovers, and results in income growth and income convergence among trading partners. Although the macro-literature has long addressed economic convergence, there has been relatively little research examining the effect of exporting on ex post firm performance. Likewise, there has been little research that examines the differential learning-by-exporting effects across industries. In this paper we build upon the convergence literature to argue that engaging in exporting provides firms, especially firms in technologically lagging industries, the opportunity to benefit disproportionately from knowledge spillovers. Using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 1997, we investigate empirically how exporting differentially influences the innovative outcomes of firms in technologically leading vs lagging industries. We find evidence that firms in technologically lagging industries (in which Spain lags the global technology frontier) learn more from exporting than those firms in technologically leading industries (in which Spain is at, or near, the global technology frontier). The results enrich the traditional convergence argument by suggesting that industry heterogeneity matters to knowledge <b>transfer,</b> and <b>stands</b> to play a substantial role in reducing knowledge gaps.

The category “budget interests” is defined as the system of budget necessities of the interest holders, implemented through budget activities of entities and aimed at seeking benefits through the budget, in order to guarantee functioning and development of the society, the state, legal entities and physical persons. “Budget necessities” are defined as the need in budget funds to achieve and sustain, at a certain level, life activities of individuals, social groups, society, state and legal entities.
