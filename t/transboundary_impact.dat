40|$|Using {{a global}} {{atmospheric}} chemistry model, we have quantified {{for the first}} time, intercontinental transboundary contributions to crop ozone exposure and subsequent yield reductions in the Northern Hemisphere. We apply four metrics (AOT 40, M 7, M 12, W 126) to assess the impacts of 100 % reductions in anthropogenic NO x emissions from North (N) America, South East (SE) Asia and Europe on global and regional exposure of 6 major agricultural crop types to surface ozone, and resultant crop production losses during the year 2000 growing season. Using these metrics, model calculations show that for wheat, rice, cotton and potato, 100 % reductions in SE Asian anthropogenic NO x emissions tend to produce the greatest global reduction in crop production losses (42. 3 – 95. 2 %), and a 100 % reduction to N~American anthropogenic NO x emissions results in the greatest global impact on crop production losses for maize and soybean (59. 2 – 85. 9 %). A 100 % reduction in N~American anthropogenic NO x emissions produces the largest <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact,</b> resulting in European production loss reductions of between 14. 2 % and 63. 2 %. European NO x emissions tend to produce a smaller <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact,</b> due to inefficiency of transport from the European domain. The threshold nature of the AOT 40 ozone-exposure metric results in strong dependence of non-local emissions impacts on the local ozone concentration distribution. Our calculations of absolute crop production change under emission reduction scenarios differ between the metrics used, however we find {{the relative importance of}} each region's <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact</b> remains robust between metrics. Our results demonstrate that local air quality and emission control strategies have the potential to partly alleviate ozone-induced crop yield loss in continents downstream, in addition to effectively mitigating local ozone-induced production losses...|$|E
30|$|When {{considering}} the groundwater potential and annual safe yield for the basin {{the potential for}} <b>Transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> must be considered. Lake Nyasa is shared between three countries while the basin borders three countries, Zambia and Malawi along the north western boundary marked by the Songwe River and Mozambique on the southern boundary (Fig.  1). The Songwe River marks the border of Tanzania with Zambia and Malawi, the river is gaining having a high groundwater baseflow. On the Zambia/Malawi side are high hills and mountains which fall towards the river indicating the groundwater flow direction is also towards the river. Extraction of groundwater within the basin (Tanzania) is unlikely to impact groundwater across the border {{and the potential for}} <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> are considered very low. However over extraction of groundwater may impact baseflow to the river and therefore surface flows in the river which may impact users {{on both sides of the}} border. The southern basin boundary with Mozambique is an arbitrary line which doesn’t follow topographic features, therefore there is a potential for <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts.</b> However the length of border is short and in a mountainous area with high rainfall and low population limiting the potential for extraction. The potential for <b>transboundary</b> groundwater <b>impacts</b> are therefore considered low to very low.|$|R

This paper aims to critically analyse the legal and procedural features of bilateral cooperation through the comparison of two case studies related to water management projects (the Sela and Alqueva dams). The paper highlights procedural weaknesses and puts forward a “Good Practice Model” for cooperation under transboundary EIA processes.

40|$|Enhanced {{surface ozone}} {{concentrations}} {{are known to}} be harmful to vegetation, reducing crop growth and yields. Tropospheric ozone concentrations have increased steadily since pre-industrial times, driven by in-situ production from anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), CO and volatile organic compounds. Transport of ozone and its precursors between continents has been shown to contribute to surface ozone air quality exceedences in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Using a global atmospheric chemistry model, we have quantified for the first time, intercontinental contributions to crop ozone exposure and yield reduction in the Northern Hemisphere. We apply three metrics (AOT 40 /M 7 /M 12) to assess the impacts of NOx emissions from each of the Northern Hemispheres three major industrialised regions (North (N) America, South East (SE) Asia and Europe) on global and regional exposure of 6 major agricultural crop types to harmful ozone concentrations, and the resultant yield losses during the 2000 growing season. Using these metrics, model calculations show that for wheat, rice, cotton and potato, 100 % reductions in SE Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions tend to produce the greatest global reduction in crop yield losses (48. 8 to 94. 7 %) with the same cuts to N American emissions resulting in the greatest global impact on crop yield reductions for maize and soybean (57. 5 to 81. 7 %). N American NOx emissions produce the largest <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact,</b> resulting in European yield loss reductions of between 12. 4 % and 55. 6 %, when a 100 % cut is applied to NOx emissions from the N American region. European NOx emissions tend to produce a smaller <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact,</b> due to inefficiency of transport from the European domain. The threshold nature of the AOT 40 ozone-exposure metric, results in a strong dependence of the diagnosed impact from trans-boundary emissions on local ozone concentration. In addition, we find that in parts of the United States, biomass burning emissions may make important contributions to ozone-induced crop yield reductions. Our results demonstrate that local air quality and emission control strategies have the potential to partly alleviate ozone-induced crop yield loss in continents downstream, in addition to effectively mitigating local ozone-induced yield losses...|$|E

40|$|Not long ago, China's {{environmental}} problems would have barely mattered beyond its borders. Now, while Chinese policy-makers {{have begun to}} tackle {{a wide range of}} domestic environmental challenges, the <b>transboundary</b> <b>impact</b> of China's domestic environmental difficulties deserves greater attention. Although China has historically neglected the transboundary impacts of its {{environmental problems}}, state actors are increasingly focusing on transboundary environmental relations. Based upon extensive field research in the Mekong Region, I have identified a number of situations in which China has sought to engage in transboundary environmental management. However, at the same time, in the same region, I have identified other situations where it has not been willing to take its transboundary environmental management responsibilities seriously. This dissertation seeks to explain this pattern of behavior. In particular, my assumption is that under certain circumstances, non-state actors, including civil society organizations and multilaterals, operating both inside China and in the world-at-large, through a process I call networked governance, are able to influence China's willingness to take its transboundary environmental responsibilities seriously. This research suggests it is increasingly important for these external non-state actors to better understand the mechanisms they can utilize to engage China's decision-makers in collaboratively managing transboundary natural resources. The Chinese central government is slowly relinquishing its role of supreme decision-maker. The Mekong Region is a complex web of inter-organizational networks that reach out, formally and informally, to China's environmental policy and decision-makers, at both the provincial and national levels. (cont.) Based on an analysis of four detailed case studies, I conclude that these networks exert 'extra-bureaucratic' influence over China's policy and decision-making, generating a specific form of environmental governance in the region. China appears to be slowly shifting its approach to the management of transboundary natural resources. by Erik Nielsen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Consumer {{information}} labelling is a {{vital part}} of modern environmental regulation, which has significant advantages over traditional command and control and market mechanism approaches. However, labelling has been accused of distorting competitive conditions by promoting discrimination between imported and domestic like products and by misleading consumers about certain types of products. The problem is qualitatively different from other types of trade dispute because labelling speaks directly to the consumer and her role within freely operating markets. The conflict has become entrenched in textual and ideological disagreements and demands a new approach that acknowledges the importance of providing consumers with information about the environmental implications of their purchasing decisions, while continuing {{to protect the rights of}} exporting WTO Members. This article explores the nature of consumer information labelling in regulatory theory and environmental law and policy, and develops an analytical framework that may help to break the current deadlock. This points towards the use of a proportionality approach with particular emphasis on the distance between consumers and the <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> of their purchasing choices.

Talks between international socio-environment groups, public–private dam partners, and Mekong countries are increasingly fractious and dysfunctional. The departure of the multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, from large-scale infrastructure funding has allowed the private sector access to investment opportunities in hydropower, {{and as a result}} facilitated the promise of rapid hydropower growth in the Lao PDR. The antagonism of international social and environmental groups towards these dams is due primarily to the <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> of multiple constructions and modifications to the Mekong.

40|$|The {{judgment}} of the International Court of Justice in the Pulp Mills (Argentina v. Uruguay) case makes a very important contribution to international law relating to shared international water resources and to international environmental law more generally. It does much to clarify the relationship between procedural and substantive rules of international environmental law. The Court linked interstate notification of new projects {{to the satisfaction of}} the customary due diligence obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm. It found that environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an essential requirement of customary international law in respect of activities having potential transboundary effects. The real significance of the judgment is that it held that the duty to notify, and the related duty to conduct an EIA taking account of <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts,</b> exist in customary international law and thus apply to all states, not just those that have concluded international agreements containing such obligations. The Court confirmed that for shared international water resources, the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation, universally accepted as the cardinal rule of international water law, is virtually synonymous with the concept of sustainable development, and suggests that considerations of environmental protection are absolutely integral to the equitable balancing of interests involved. The judgment makes it clear that the principle of equitable utilisation ought to be understood as a process, rather than a normatively determinative rule.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the {{economic}} assessment of large projects is sensitive to assumptions about discounting future costs and benefits. Projects that require high upfront investments and take years to begin producing economic benefits can be difficult to justify with the discount rates typically used for project appraisal. While most economists argue that social discount rates should be below 4 %, many international development banks and government planning agencies responsible for project appraisal can be found using rates of 7 - 12 % or more. These agencies justify choosing higher discount rates to account for the opportunity cost of capital. Meanwhile, a new and robust debate has begun in economics over whether social discount rates of even 3 - 4 % are too high in the context of climate change. This paper reviews the recent discounting controversy and examines its implications for the appraisal of an illustrative hydropower project in Ethiopia. The analysis uses an integrated hydro-economic model that accounts for how the dam’s <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> vary with climate change. The real value of the dam is found to be highly sensitive to assumptions about future economic growth. The argument for investment is weakest under conditions of robust global economic growth, particularly if these coincide with unfavourable hydrological or development factors related to the project. If however long-term growth is reduced, the value of the dam tends to increase. There may also be distributional or local arguments favouring investment, if growth in the investment region lags behind that {{of the rest of the}} globe. In such circumstances, a large dam can be seen as a form of insurance that protects future vulnerable generations against the possibility of macroeconomic instability or climate shocks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses a {{framework}} of contextualised critical hydropolitics with reference to political ecology and environmental justice in order to investigate different framings of water resources management practices in the Sesan transboundary river basin. The study applies an ethnographic approach to observe and assess how participation and integration are conceptualised and manifested {{in the form of}} debates and discussions at public meetings and other contexts. The result of the empirical research shows that integration and participation are framed and interpreted in various ways, shifting from a critique and challenge to existing ways of doing things toward an appropriation of progressive discourse by more powerful actors to claim legitimacy and maintain authority in water governance. The case of IWRM-led planning in the Mekong and Sesan demonstrates how integration and participation become programmatic- the circumstances that the voices of the dam-affected people and their concerns are programmatised and grassroots grievances and responses to the impacts of Sesan dams relevant to transboundary governance are downplayed and depoliticised. As a result, the involvement of the dam-affected people in water resources management continues to be short-changed and they are generally left out of the Sesan decision-making process. In the case of Sesan advocacy, as demonstrated by grassroots movements such as the 3 SPN, integration and participation are framed in terms of what may be termed a ‘justice-orientation’ to transboundary governance which has greater significance in bringing about justice for the dam-affected people. The thesis concludes that the social framings of Sesan <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> through a discourse of integration and participation are devices for hegemonic actors such as development bank agents and water managers to claim their legitimacy in Sesan water resources management and impose their views of governance on other actors...|$|R

40|$|A {{reduction}} of trade barriers will influence the overall scale of agricultural activities, {{the structure of}} agricultural production in different countries, the mix of inputs and outputs, the production technology, and the regulatory framework. These adjustments, in turn, will impact on the international and domestic environment by increasing or reducing environmental harm and creating or destroying environmental amenities. International environmental effects include transboundary spill-overs, such as greenhouse gas emissions, changes in international transport flows, and the potential introduction of non-native species, pests and diseases alongside agricultural products. Domestic environmental effects include ground- and surfacewater pollution from fertiliser and pesticide run-offs, and changes in land-use that affect landscape appearance, flood protection, soil quality, and biodiversity. This study illustrates the direction and magnitude {{of some of the}} environmental impacts by combining preliminary results on the commodity market impacts of agricultural trade liberalisation with agri- environmental indicators. The international environmental impacts indicate that projected medium-term increases in ruminant livestock numbers could lead to substantial increases in methane emissions in some OECD countries, which could warrant the attention of policy makers in the context of existing Kyoto Protocol commitments on greenhouse gas emissions. With respect to domestic environmental impacts, the quantitative analysis suggests that agricultural prices and production intensity would decrease in countries that have had historically high levels of fertiliser and pesticide application, so that environmental stress in these countries would be relieved. Countries where increases in production intensity occur might be able to accommodate increased application rates of agro-chemicals relatively easily, as their historical levels of fertiliser and pesticide use tend to be low. Projections on the effects of further agricultural trade liberalisation on land use do not suggest substantial changes in agricultural land. Yet, the analysis does not allow to derive firm conclusions on prospective changes in landscape appearance, soil and flood protection, and biodiversity, since the projections did not explicitly consider some environmentally sensitive areas, such as pastures and marginal agricultural land.

40|$|United States {{commercial}} fisheries are managed by regional councils whose jurisdictions are circumscribed by political boundaries. Species range often spans management borders, linking fishing regions by participation. On the East Coast, individuals commonly prosecute several fisheries managed by different councils. This study tests both {{the existence and}} magnitude of policy-induced <b>transboundary</b> <b>impacts</b> on fishery participation, {{with the goal of}} providing a quantitative starting point for further investigation into the economic and social impact of spillover fishing effort. Regulatory structures vary across a spectrum from open access to individual harvest rights. In 2010, the New England Fishery Management Council expanded a cooperative rights-based management program – “sectors” – to enhance stock sustainability and economic efficiency in the groundfish fishery. Groundfish sector management altered the deployment of fishing effort in New England. Newly idled groundfish fishers possess the potential to increase participation in regulated open access Mid-Atlantic fisheries characterized by low entry barriers. This study utilizes econometric methods to estimate the transboundary effect of sector management on Mid-Atlantic fisheries. The use of a difference-in-differences estimation strategy allows the author to evaluate the causal link between New England sector management and altered fishing effort directed towards Mid-Atlantic managed species. Econometric methodology is employed to control for exogenous factors that may also affect fishing effort and to assess the unobservable policy counterfactual of present day Mid-Atlantic effort levels in the absence of New England groundfish sectors. The study finds that the establishment of groundfish sectors does affect Mid-Atlantic fisheries, but impacts are not uniform across species nor are they uniform across the 17 groundfish sectors. Further, effort redirection can be more or less pronounced when looking at the behavior of enrolled sector members, or looking only at those sector members who are now inactive in New England fisheries. Certain sectors are identified as redirecting more effort towards Mid-Atlantic species. While cumulative effort spillover {{does not seem to be}} pushing Mid-Atlantic fisheries perilously close to capacity limits, the identified influx can impact profitability in effort-receiving fisheries and could potentially have a negative effect on socioeconomic outcomes in the greater regional fishing economy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze long term changes of surface water quality in Latvia, spatial {{variability}} of water chemical composition, possible impacts of different pollution sources as well as to analyze the measures to protect national water resources - river basin management. Within this study, the concentrations of major water ingredients and microelements in major rivers and lakes of Latvia have been determined. Metal concentrations in river and lake waters were compared with water chemical composition. The mean concentrations of trace metals in inland waters of Latvia are appreciably lower than the estimated world averages for river waters and close to or lower than background values, unless regional impacts determined by local geochemistry. This may be explained by a comparatively lower level of anthropogenic load. In the same time in several places, direct anthropogenic impacts are evident, regarding influences of point sources both <b>transboundary</b> transport <b>impacts.</b> Also, different processes related to pollution of surface waters in Latvia have been analyzed. At first the analysis of changes and composition of pollutant emissions in Latvia has been realized, and the obtained results were compared with actual composition of atmospheric precipitation and their changes in time...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{defines the}} concept of ecologization of {{international}} relations, analyses trends and steps of ecologization and environmental law development. Special role of UN in global environmental problems solving is highlighted. Ecologization of international regulation of marine-related activities is considered as an extremely importantdue to marine resources degradation, marine <b>transboundary</b> pollution, human <b>impact</b> in the coastal zones, high level of uncertainty and risk of marine-related activities. Ecologization of international relations in the Black Sea basin is realized by mechanism of conventions, international programs and international projects. Special role of the Black Sea Commission and International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River is emphasized. Recommendations for rasing the level of international relations ecologization in the Black Sea basin are mad...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In recent years, the {{potential}} adverse <b>impacts</b> of <b>transboundary</b> pollution have received heightened attention both domestically and abroad. 1 International pollution may detrimentally affect outer space, the atmosphere, the oceans, the weather, {{and possibly the}} climate, freshwater bodies, groundwater aquifers, farmland, cultural heritage, and life forms. 2 Specific pollution threats include acid deposition, nuclear contamination, debris in outer space, stratospheric ozone depletion, and toxic petroleum spills. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, on April 26, 1986, raised the world 2 ̆ 7 s consciousness about {{the potential}}ly devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution. 3 Given this backdrop and the emerging interdependence of nations, particularly within the European Economic Community, {{it is not surprising}} that the United States, later joined by twenty-five other countries, signed the 2 ̆ 2 Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context 2 ̆ 2 (hereinafter 2 ̆ 2 the Convention 2 ̆ 2) at Espoo, Finland on February 25, 1991. 4 Among its provisions, the Convention establishes legal procedures for bilateral and multilateral protests against future sources of transboundary pollution. 5 The Convention also establishes a <b>transboundary</b> environmental <b>impact</b> assessment process similar to the process implemented under the U. S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which is the first national environmental impact assessment law passed by the U. S. government. 6 However, three years have passed since the United States signed the Convention, and it still has not been formally adopted. 7 Consequently, questions about its legal basis remain. This Article examines issues relating to the implementation and enforceability of the Convention in the United States [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Asia faces serious {{challenges}} in water, food and energy security for its growing and rapidly urbanising population. ● Scientific {{understanding of the}} mechanisms underpinning these three critical resources, as well as general awareness, have greatly improved of late, but little has changed on the ground. ● Rational use of these resources requires integrated planning that reflects interdependencies and trade-offs, but government planning is mainly sector-based and not open to an integrated approach. ● Shared international resources, such as of trans-border rivers, highlight the challenges of effective planning for sustainable use. ● This chapter analyses the Mekong River basin and discusses how this shared resource could be rationally used through nexus approach. ● It recommends strengthening the Mekong River Commission via bolstered resources and coordinating authority, and encourages China to participate as a full member. It also recommends <b>Transboundary</b> Environmental <b>Impact</b> Assessments of river projects be conducted to reflect synergic and trade off nexus effect across the whole river basin. 1. Nexus approach for sustainable regional integration in resources security Water, energy and food are fundamental to human survival, economic growth and sustainable development. Rapid urbanisation and global population growth are placing huge pressures on these resources, the shortage of any one of {{which could lead to}} social and political instability, geopolitical conflict, human health hazards as well as irreparable environmental damage, both within individual countries and beyond national borders. Ensuring human basic needs such as water, food and energy often extends beyond the capacity of a single nation, and although regional cooperation intends to promote resource access beyond national borders (Rosner and Granit 2012), efforts to date hav...|$|R
