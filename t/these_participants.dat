5|$|On the Eastern Front in World War II Suslov was {{a member}} of Military Council of the North Caucasian Front and led the Stavropol Krai Headquarters of the Partisan Divisions (the local guerrilla movement). According to Soviet historiography, Suslov's years as a guerrilla fighter were highly successful; however, testimonies from {{participants}} differ from the official account. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> claim that {{there were a number of}} organisational problems which reduced their effectiveness on the battlefield. During the war, Suslov spent much of his time mobilising workers to fight against the German invaders. The guerrilla movement he led was operated by the regional party cells. During the liberation of the Northern Caucasus, Suslov maintained close contact with the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.|$|E

25|$|Schneider et al. {{also studied}} {{the effects of}} {{combining}} music therapy with standard motor rehabilitation methods. In this experiment, researchers recruited stroke patients without prior musical experience and trained half of them in an intensive step by step training program that occurred fifteen times over three weeks, in addition to traditional treatment. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> were trained to use both fine and gross motor movements by learning {{how to use the}} piano and drums. The other half of the patients received only traditional treatment {{over the course of the}} three weeks. Three-dimensional movement analysis and clinical motor tests showed participants who received the additional music therapy had significantly better speed, precision, and smoothness of movement as compared to the control subjects. Participants who received music therapy also showed a significant improvement in every-day motor activities as compared to the control group. Wilson, Parsons, & Reutens looked at the effect of melodic intonation therapy (MIT) on speech production in a male singer with severe Broca's aphasia. In this study, thirty novel phrases were taught in three conditions: unrehearsed, rehearsed verbal production (repetition), or rehearsed verbal production with melody (MIT). Results showed that phrases taught in the MIT condition had superior production, and that compared to rehearsal, effects of MIT lasted longer.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{has found}} that people also engage in sexual {{activity}} for reasons associated with self-determination theory. The self-determination theory {{can be applied to}} a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership. Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation. [...] The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation. This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.|$|E

2500|$|Lorazepam {{is a type}} of benzodiazepine, a {{psychoactive drug}} used for the {{short-term}} treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures including status sedation of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of aggressive patients. Research has been conducted to investigate the effects of lorazepam on TOT states in response to general knowledge question. In a recall task, participants who received lorazepam showed the same number of total recall answers to participants who had not received lorazepam. [...] However, the lorazepam participants produced more incorrect recall responses to their TOT states. Lorazepam may inhibit the retrieval of the correct response. Participants under the influence of lorazepam did not experience the subjective feeling that they were in a TOT state (i.e., the feeling of being on the verge of recalling the word). <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> experienced the subjective feeling of a TOT state only after they were told that their response was incorrect. [...] As a result, it appears that <b>these</b> <b>participants</b> are not aware that their answer is incorrect and only experience the subjective feeling of TOT states if they are told their answer is incorrect. Lorazepam may create conditions where alternative answers come to mind more easily. Furthermore, lorazepam suppresses emotions, which may be why participants taking this drug do not experience the subjective feelings that accompany TOT states; thus enabling the recall of alternative responses. These findings suggest that lorazepam does not increase the probability of TOT states but it does inhibit the retrieval of correct responses and the subjective feeling of TOT states, leading participants to give incorrect answers without being aware.|$|E
2500|$|Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a {{grounded}} theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult [...] "careleavers" [...] (N = 28, aged 18–26) in Israel and Germany {{to assume a}} helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying {{as a result of}} helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self-efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers:"The fact that I could bring a runaway girl back to her home and I made her trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, {{these are the things that}} give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better situation than others" [...] (p. 45).|$|E

2500|$|An {{incident}} {{that took place}} on Golden State Freeway June 17, 1992, brought public attention {{to the existence of}} organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud. These schemes generally consist of three different levels. At the top, there are the professionals—doctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries and/or file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud. Next are the [...] "capper (insurance fraud)s" [...] or [...] "runners", the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. <b>These</b> <b>participants</b> at the bottom-rung of the scheme are desperate people (poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash) who are paid around $1000 USD to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks, playing a kind of Russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them. According to investigators, cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups. What makes busting these staged-accident crime rings difficult is how quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement, after a crackdown in a particular region. As a result, in the US several levels of police and the insurance industry have cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim histories.|$|E
