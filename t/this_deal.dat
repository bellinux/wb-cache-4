5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When <b>this</b> <b>deal</b> fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having the}} better chances, York drew 0–0 {{at home with}} Cambridge United, before being beaten 3–1 away by Wrexham, in which Wilkinson scored a late {{consolation}} goal. The club made an attempt to re-sign former striker Clayton Donaldson on loan from Crewe Alexandra, but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later, due to him being injured. York's first double of the season came with a 2–0 away win over Woking, the goals coming from Wilkinson and McBreen. Iyseden Christie's loan spell at Kettering from Stevenage was to be terminated for a loan move to York to go ahead, but <b>this</b> <b>deal</b> fell through.

Hours later, Ella and Rumpelstiltskin meet to sign the deal. Ella lies to him and says she is expecting twins and will give him both of the babies in exchange for improving the crops and wealth of the kingdom. A skeptical Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but as he signs the contract, he is rendered powerless due to a special red quill pen, that was created by The Blue Fairy. He is captured, but Thomas disappears soon after. Ella demands that Rumpelstiltskin tell her what has happened, but he claims not to have done anything. He reminds her that all magic has a price, and that until her debt is paid she will never see Thomas again.|$|E

To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} licensed to Georgetown University under the callsign WGTB, and was programmed by Georgetown {{students with a}} progressive rock format. In 1979, the Georgetown administration decided that the station did not fit with the public image they desired for the university, and sold the station to the University of the District of Columbia for US$1. UDC took ownership officially on March 12, 1980, and WGTB became WDCU, with a jazz format. During a budgetary crisis in mid-1997, the school sold WDCU for $13 million to C-SPAN, a non-profit funded by the cable television industry. UDC had planned to sell the station to Christian radio conglomerate Salem Communications; however <b>this</b> <b>deal</b> was unsuccessful, leading to C-SPAN’s accepted purchase of WDCU. Once the station was purchased, broadcasting of C-SPAN Radio on WCSP-FM began on October 9, 1997.|$|E
5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For <b>this</b> <b>deal,</b> Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the RNZAF {{considered}} options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals {{to upgrade the}} Skyhawks. After {{the decision was made}} to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of <b>this</b> <b>deal</b> on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up, and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part of the purchase agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service.|$|E
5|$|In late January 2017, it was {{announced}} that WIN and Southern Cross Austereo had commenced negotiations over the sale of SCA's Ten affiliate station NRN in Northern NSW in exchange for WIN's Wollongong radio station i98FM. <b>This</b> <b>deal</b> would have given SCA access to the Wollongong radio market and allowed WIN to expand into the Northern NSW market for the first time, giving it coverage across all regional eastern Australian markets. Southern Cross later withdrew from negotiations on 20 February 2017 with no explanation given. However, WIN and Southern Cross later finalised an agreement on 28 March 2017 where they would sell NRN to WIN for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. NRN was maintained as Ten Northern NSW until playout and transmission are transferred to WIN on 1 September 2017, at that point the station adopted the WIN branding. The channel numbers will also be reshuffled to align with WIN's other stations, but as Nine-owned NBN Television holds the 8-numbered digital channels in northern NSW, NRN's digital channels will remain on the 5-numbered digital channels.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to <b>this</b> <b>deal,</b> in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E
