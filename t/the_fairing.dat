5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{the nozzle}} {{protruded}} from the back, but this {{turned out to}} be aerodynamically disadvantageous. In June 2004, between flights 14P and 15P, a fairing was added, smoothly extending the fuselage shape to meet the flared end of the nozzle. On flight 15P the new fairing overheated, due to being black on the inside and facing a hot, black nozzle. <b>The</b> <b>fairing</b> softened, and the lower part crumpled inwards during boost. Following that flight the interior of <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> was painted white, and some small stiffening ribs were added.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> took {{a five-year}} hiatus from 1942 to 1946. But <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> {{was back in}} {{operation}} in 1947. 1950 saw the first carnival rides at <b>the</b> <b>Fair.</b> In 1956, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> Board petitioned <b>the</b> Alaska Legislature for official designation as <b>the</b> Alaska State <b>Fair.</b> In 1960, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> celebrated its 25th anniversary and was paid a visit by President John F.

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>fair</b> {{was held}} in 1878 and was known as <b>the</b> Lutherville <b>Fair.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} year, 1879, <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> was moved to its current location in Timonium and was held from September 9 through September 12. In 1906, <b>the</b> Lutherville <b>Fair</b> merged with <b>the</b> Pimlico <b>Fair</b> and became known as <b>the</b> Maryland State <b>Fair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fair</b> was suspended from 1943 through 1945 during World War II. In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> grew to its current length of 11 days.|$|R
50|$|In August 1893, the U.S. Congress {{approved}} for <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> {{to be held}} in Golden Gate Park. Prior to <b>the</b> Midwinter <b>Fair's</b> opening day, in 1893, Isaiah West Taber won the concession to be the official photographer of <b>the</b> <b>fair.</b> Taber documented <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> from when <b>the</b> grading of the land began, and continued photographing <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> throughout its entirety. He sold his photos in a striking, multi-story pavilion during the exposition, on <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> grounds. At <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> he compiled about 130 of his original photographs into a souvenir book entitled Souvenir of the California Midwinter International Exposition. Much of what is known about <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> especially visually, comes from Taber's photographs.|$|R

25|$|The {{first flight}} of a Falcon 9 v1.1 (CASSIOPE, September 2013) {{was the first}} launch of the Falcon 9 v1.1 {{as well as the}} Falcon 9 family {{configured}} with a payload fairing. <b>The</b> <b>fairing</b> separated without incident during the launch of CASSIOPE as well as the two subsequent GTO insertion missions. In Dragon missions, the capsule protects any small satellites, negating the need for a fairing.|$|E

It has a stereo with speakers in <b>the</b> <b>fairing,</b> Bluetooth media players, tire pressure sensors, air-adjustable rear shock, and motorized windshield adjustment. Initial reports from the press were favorable for styling, performance, and handling. The Chieftain was named 2013 Motorcycle of the Year by RoadRunner Motorcycle Touring & Travel magazine.|$|E

25|$|Ergonomic and {{cosmetic}} {{changes for the}} 2008 model include a higher windscreen, and interlocking gauge faces with a digital speedometer, {{as well as a}} new gear indicator and adjustable shift light. <b>The</b> <b>fairing</b> fasteners were hidden to uncomplicate custom paint work. The twin-spar aluminum frame was carried over from the previous version, and wheelbase, rake/trail, and seat height were the same, while overall length grew by two inches, and the taller windscreen added about ½inch. Weight was saved by omitting the centerstand.|$|E
25|$|Kliper's {{design was}} {{another attempt to}} solve the {{geometric}} problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, {{to be used for}} eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and <b>the</b> <b>fairing</b> over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had.|$|E

That same year, <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> accepted 10,890 exhibit entries - the highest on record. <b>The</b> <b>Fair</b> set another record in 2003, with 312,419 visitors attending <b>the</b> <b>Fair</b> over a 12-day period.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, an arson {{occurred}} {{just before}} the opening of <b>the</b> <b>fair,</b> burning several large structures. Along with <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> commissioners, Governor Tom McCall felt <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> should go on, so many groups donated time and money for the cleanup and sent facilities like tents {{from as far away}} as the Portland Rose Festival so <b>the</b> <b>fair</b> could open.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fair</b> is {{operated}} by a board of 100 shareholders. The shares were first sold in 1901 {{to raise funds for}} <b>the</b> <b>fair's</b> continued operation. Shares are passed through families and give the shareholders 100th ownership and a vote in <b>fair</b> proceedings. <b>The</b> <b>fair,</b> however, is a completely non-profit venture and shareholders receive no portion of <b>the</b> <b>fair's</b> revenue.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2014, the European Space Agency (ESA) {{agreed to}} be a partner on the DC4EU project, and will also {{investigate}} whether the Dream Chaser can use ESA avionics and docking mechanisms. [...] ESA will also study launching options for the [...] "Europeanized" [...] Dream Chaser, particularly whether it can be launched within the Ariane 5's large aerodynamic cargo fairing – or, like the Atlas V, without it. In order to fit within <b>the</b> <b>fairing,</b> the Dream Chaser's wing length {{will have to be}} reduced slightly, which is thought to be easier than going through a full aerodynamic test program to evaluate and prove it along with the Ariane for flight without <b>the</b> <b>fairing.</b>|$|E

The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through <b>the</b> <b>fairing.</b> From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.|$|E
