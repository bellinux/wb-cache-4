5|$|The art colony at Eagle's Nest was {{populated}} by Chicago artists, {{all members of}} the Chicago Art Institute or the University of Chicago art department, who gathered in Ogle County to escape <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat</b> of Chicago. Two of the charter members of the art colony were the Chicago architects, Allen and Irving Kane Pond, who designed the Oregon Public Library building. It was the Ponds' association with the Eagle's Nest Art Colony that led them to design the library.|$|E

According to historians Joseph Persico and Hazel Rowley, the affair between Mercer and Franklin likely began in 1916, when Eleanor {{and the children were}} vacationing at Campobello Island to avoid <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat,</b> while Franklin remained in Washington, D.C. In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend.|$|E

60|$|Like European Russia, also, the Saskatchewan {{district}} has {{a climate of}} extremes--the thermometer having a wide range; but it is well understood that {{the growth of the}} cereals and of the most useful vegetables depends chiefly on the intensity and duration of <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heats,</b> and is comparatively little influenced by the severity of winter cold, or the lowness of the mean temperature during the year. Therefore it is important to observe that the northern shore of Lake Huron has <b>the</b> mean <b>summer</b> <b>heat</b> of Bordeaux, in southern France, or 70 degrees Fahrenheit; while Cumberland House, in latitude 54 degrees, longitude 102 degrees, on the Saskatchewan, exceeds in this respect Brussels and Paris.|$|R
5|$|Grant {{was nearly}} broke and worried {{constantly}} about leaving {{his wife a}} suitable {{amount of money to}} live on. Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat</b> and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade in}} New England ice {{expanded}} during the 1830s and 1840s across the eastern {{coast of the}} U.S., while new trade routes were created across the world. The first and most profitable of these new routes was to India: in 1833 Tudor combined with the businessmen Samuel Austin and William Rogers to attempt to export ice to Calcutta using the brigantine ship the Tuscany. The Anglo-Indian elite, concerned {{about the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat,</b> quickly agreed to exempt the imports from the usual East India Company regulations and trade tariffs, and the initial net shipment of around a hundred tons (90,000kg) sold successfully. With the ice fetching for three pence (£0.80 in 2010 terms) per pound (0.5kg), the first shipment aboard the Tuscany produced profits of $9,900 ($253,000), and in 1835 Tudor commenced regular exports to Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.|$|E
5|$|This final Confederate assault {{through the}} Wheatfield {{continued}} past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat</b> and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed {{to the left}} along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield.|$|E

5|$|During the British Raj, Darjeeling's {{temperate}} climate {{led to its}} development as a hill station for British residents seeking to escape <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat</b> of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly. Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and Lieutenant Robert Napier were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849. The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842. In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850. Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there. Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the Bengal Presidency after 1864. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881 further hastened {{the development of the}} region. In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major landslides that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{relocated}} from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans {{finally found}} {{success on the}} field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities - it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a full size CFL field, also, it was an indoor, air-conditioned facility which meant the teams playing there {{did not have to}} deal with <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>heat.</b> The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached {{as a member of the}} Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.|$|E
