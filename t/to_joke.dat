5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|The role of Johnny {{was written}} by Jarmusch {{specifically}} for Joe Strummer, {{who had been the}} frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two were together in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> with the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 {{the band}} {{returned}} to BOSS Studios to record enough material for two full-length albums. Both were originally offered to Alternative Tentacles, {{with the first}} being Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac. Before either album could be released, though, Alternative Tentacles had to acquire the master tapes from Bob O'Neill, BOSS Studios' namesake and owner. He refused to release them until he'd been reimbursed for the sessions, and Alternative Tentacles couldn't immediately afford to pay. After months of waiting, the band issued the concert recording Live PCPPEP on Alternative Tentacles out of financial desperation in September 1984. Mostly made up of live performances of songs from their debut, it prompted some critics and fans <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that they had released the same album twice. Meanwhile, Bob O'Neill was preparing to release Psychic... on his own Ward 9 label to recoup his expenses.|$|E

5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> and tease these girls, deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1995–96 season, {{shortly after}} Watford's relegation from the First Division, Hessenthaler signed for Gillingham for £235,000, a record fee at the time for the club. He quickly became a key player at Priestfield Stadium. In the 1998–99 season, he {{returned}} to his best form, and he played in the Gills' first ever match at Wembley Stadium. This match was the final of the play-offs against Manchester City, which Gillingham lost after a penalty shoot-out. Shortly afterwards, Gillingham manager Tony Pulis, who had signed Hessenthaler, was dismissed from his post. He was replaced by Peter Taylor, who appointed Hessenthaler as player-coach. In his first season in this new role, he was once again a regular in the Gillingham team, making a total of 47 appearances as the club recorded its highest position to date in the English football league system and best ever run in the FA Cup. Although the cup run came to an end with a 5–0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea of the Premier League, Hessenthaler's high-energy performance prompted Chelsea chairman Ken Bates <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that he had been keen to sign the player until he discovered to his surprise that he was 35 years old (although Hessenthaler was in fact only 34 at the time). Gillingham once again qualified for the play-off final, with Hessenthaler making his second appearance at Wembley as the Gills beat Wigan Athletic 3–2 after extra time to secure promotion to the Football League First Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history.|$|E

25|$|In 1994 Landrieu made an {{unsuccessful}} {{bid for the}} office of Mayor of New Orleans; the office went to Marc Morial, the son of another former mayor (the contest between sons of former mayors prompted some commentators <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> about establishing a tradition of primogeniture for the city's top office).|$|E
25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not <b>to</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E

25|$|The CTM then proceeded, {{with the}} {{implicit}} {{help of the}} State, to eliminate independent union leaders in industrial unions such as miners, oil and railroad workers. The state exercised its authority to oust uncooperative union leaders, either by removing them directly or manipulating internal union elections. The CTM concurred, leading some observers <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that the CTM now meant se teme ("to be feared").|$|E
25|$|The Cavaliers were a {{young team}} in 2006, leading Groh <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that the 2007 team {{was playing the}} 2006 season. While Groh had {{frequently}} played true freshman in earlier seasons, sometime for very limited action, he redshirted the entire freshman class in 2006 except for defensive lineman Nate Collins. Several players from that class {{are expected to be}} contributors in 2007, in particular running back Keith Payne has generated excitement among fans. Several talented true freshmen, such as quarterback Peter Lalich, joined the team in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} {{problems of the}} College were based upon {{the fact that there}} had been a failure to find a 'local Carnegie' – a business magnate who could finance the University by providing endowments and financing the payment of staff. The passing of the Technical Instruction Act empowered local authorities to level a rate for technical instruction. Bristol was able to apply for a further £2,000 in funds and a further £500 was gained in return for an agreement that free places would be made available to some students. This money was used to build an Engineering block. A few months earlier the Medical School building had been finished and formally incorporated into the College. It was not until 1899 that the College began to receive any kind of state funding, leading one lecturer <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that the motto of the College should be not Knowledge is power but College is poor; until this time the college was wholly dependent upon the student fees paid for the courses. However, the College was expanded as finances allowed during the 1890s after it had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times the decade before.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard's authorship in mid-1938 of a still-unpublished {{manuscript}} called Excalibur {{is highlighted}} by the Church of Scientology as a key step in developing the principles of Scientology and Dianetics. The manuscript is said by Scientologists to have outlined [...] "the basic principles of human existence" [...] and {{to have been the}} culmination of twenty years of research into [...] "twenty-one races and cultures including Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, Philippine Tagalogs and, as he was wont <b>to</b> <b>joke,</b> the people of the Bronx".|$|E
500|$|The Gentleman's Magazine of 1797 {{reviewed}} The History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell, {{commenting on}} his claim ("Resurgam", Latin for 'I shall rise') to have {{returned from the}} dead (having announced {{the end of his}} literary life back in 1791), and continuing <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> about his excesses throughout.

500|$|Like {{the pilot}} episode, [...] "The Transformation" [...] begins on the {{passenger}} section of an airplane in flight. Actor Mark Valley was asked how the episode differed from the pilot, leading him <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> that [...] "it's a completely different airline this time." [...] His character, John Scott, was first seen in an episode about a plane disaster; accordingly, IGN expressed, it made sense thematically to have his last appearance be in an episode about a similar type of disaster. The Los Angeles Times viewed the flight number of 718 and its subsequent crash as a nod to co-creator J.J. Abrams' other series, Lost.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{was known}} <b>to</b> <b>joke</b> {{frequently}} during his lifetime, displayed humor throughout his presidency, and {{was famous for}} his storytelling. His numerous jokes and one-liners have been labeled [...] "classic quips" [...] and [...] "legendary." [...] Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War. As a microphone test in preparation for his weekly radio address in August 1984, Reagan made the following joke: [...] "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes." [...] Former aide David Gergen commented, [...] "It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{chief of}} {{thoracic}} surgery, Benjamin L. Aaron, decided {{to perform a}} thoracotomy lasting 105 minutes because the bleeding persisted. Ultimately, Reagan lost over half of his blood volume {{in the emergency room}} and during surgery, which removed the bullet. In the operating room, Reagan removed his oxygen mask <b>to</b> <b>joke,</b> [...] "I hope you are all Republicans." [...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans." [...] Reagan's post-operative course was complicated by fever, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The surgery was routine enough that they predicted Reagan would be able to leave the hospital in two weeks and return to work at the Oval Office within a month.|$|E
