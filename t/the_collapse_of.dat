We assume <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> speed <b>of</b> fluid is {{very large and}} investigate such a situation by recently proposed high-speed approximation scheme. We show that if {{the value of the}} pressure divided by the energy density is bounded below by some positive value, <b>the</b> high-speed <b>collapse</b> is necessarily halted. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> perfect fluid <b>of</b> realistic ideal gas experiences the pressure bounce. However even in the case of mono-atomic ideal gas, arbitrarily large tidal force for freely falling observers are realizable by setting <b>the</b> initial <b>collapsing</b> velocity exceedingly large. In order that <b>the</b> high-speed <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> cylindrical perfect fluid forms spacetime singularity, the equation of state should be very soft.
