40|$|Although antispin <b>tail</b> <b>parachutes</b> {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in spin demonstrations for some time, very little published information is available concerning the size of parachute, the bridle-line length, and the type and location of pack to use for particular airplane. The present paper {{is an attempt to}} supply data relating to these factors. The paper is in two parts. The first part reviews the principles of operation of the antispin parachutes, views the principles of operation of the antispin parachutes, summarized available information on actual installations, and discusses parachute loads and pack locations. The second part of the paper reports on systematic tests in the NACA- 15 -foot and 20 -foot free-spinning tunnels at the Langley memorial Aeronautical Laboratory to determine the minimum size and the optimum bridle-line lengths for antispin <b>tail</b> <b>parachutes</b> for current military airplanes. It is concluded that airplanes weighing between 7500 and 14, 000 pounds require parachutes 8 feet in diameter and bridle-line lengths between 20 and 50 feet. A positive-ejection mechanism is desirable to throw the parachute clear of the tail and to assure rapid opening. The pack and attachment point must be so located that the equipment will not foul the tail surfaces...|$|R

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{classical}} {{cases where}} this favourable response was not achieved, notably some early T-tail jet aircraft. In {{the event of a}} very high angle of attack, the horizontal stabilizer became immersed in downwash from the wing and fuselage, causing excessive download on the stabilizer, increasing the angle of attack still further. The only way an aircraft could recover from this situation was by jettisoning tail ballast or deploying a special <b>tail</b> <b>parachute.</b> The phenomenon became known as 'deep stall'.|$|E

50|$|The wing was {{mid-mounted}} {{with some}} dihedral {{and also with}} forward sweep to improve the visibility from the tandem cockpit. The fuselage was PFP skinned over PFP frames, with a shaped balsa outer layer for smoothness. This proved to be too easily damaged and was replaced on the second aircraft with a glass-fibre shell. The HKS-1 had a fully retractable monowheel undercarriage, assisted by partially retractable nose-skid/nose-wheel combination. In the absence of airbrakes it used a <b>tail</b> ribbon <b>parachute.</b> It had a 100° V-tail of similar construction to the wings.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} by Dipl-Ing Klaus Holighaus and the {{prototype}} first flew in May 1974. The production examples incorporated several improvements in January 1975. The Janus has a glass-fibre monocoque fuselage {{similar to that}} of the Nimbus-2 but the cockpit section is lengthened to accommodate the two pilots in tandem with dual controls under a right-hand side hinged one-piece canopy. Landing gear consists of either a non-retractable main wheel (Janus A, B & C) or a retractable main wheel (later models of Janus C and all Ce's) with a drum or disc brake, and a nose-wheel. The two-piece wings have 2° forward sweep on the leading edge, and have camber-changing flaps which are operated between +12° and -7°. The Janus has upper surface airbrakes, and although uncommon the Janus C could also be fitted with a <b>tail</b> <b>parachute.</b>|$|E
50|$|A US {{certification}} standard for civil airplanes up to 12,500 lb maximum takeoff weight is Part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, applicable to airplanes in the normal, utility and acrobatic categories. Part 23, §23.221 requires that single-engine airplanes must demonstrate recovery from either a one-turn spin if intentional spins will be prohibited or six-turn spins if intentional spins will be approved. Even large, passenger-carrying single-engine airplanes like the Cessna Caravan must {{be subjected to}} one-turn spins by a test pilot and repeatedly demonstrated to recover within {{no more than one}} additional turn. With a small number of airplane types the FAA has made a finding of equivalent level of safety (ELOS) so that demonstration of a one-turn spin is not necessary. For example, this has been done with the Cessna Corvalis and the Cirrus SR20/22. Successful demonstration of the one-turn spin does not allow an airplane type to be approved for intentional spinning. If an airplane is to be approved for intentional spinning, it must be repeatedly subjected to a spin of six turns and then demonstrated to recover within one and a half additional turns. Spin testing is a potentially hazardous exercise and the test aircraft must be equipped with some spin-recovery device such as a <b>tail</b> <b>parachute</b> or jettisonable ballast, or some method of rapidly moving the center of gravity forward.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a 1 / 30 - scale model of the Grumman XFlOF- 1 airplane to determine its spin and recovery characteristics. The investigation included erect and inverted spins for both the straight-wing and swept-wing configurations. Tests to determine the optimum size spin-recovery parachutes and the rudder forces required for recovery were also made. The results indicated that in the straight-wing configuration, satisfactory recoveries of the airplane will be obtained from erect and inverted spins by rudder reversal alone. In the swept-wing configuration recoveries will be unsatisfactory from erect spins. Unsweeping the wings during the spin and reversal of the rudder, however, will lead to eventual recovery. The test results also indicated that, if existing small ailerons are made deflectable through large angles, satisfactory recoveries will be obtained from erect spins in the swept-wing configuration by simultaneous movement of the rudder to against the spin and movement of the ailerons to with the spin. Normal-size ailerons deflected through a normal range would also be effective. Satisfactory recoveries by rudder reversal will be obtained from inverted spins in the swept-wing configuration. In the straight-wing configuration a 14. 2 -foot <b>tail</b> <b>parachute</b> or a 5. 0 -foot wing-tip parachute opened on the outer wing tip will effect satisfactory recovery of the airplane by parachute action alone; a 30. 0 -foot <b>tail</b> <b>parachute</b> or a 10. 0 -foot wing-tip parachute will be required for the swept-wing configuration.

50|$|Second Lieutenant Kingsley's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} life above and beyond the call of duty, June 23, 1944 near Ploesti, Rumania, while flying as bombardier of a B17 type aircraft. On the bomb run 2d Lt. Kingsley's aircraft was severely damaged by intense flak and forced to drop out of formation but the pilot proceeded over the target and 2d Lt. Kingsley successfully dropped his bombs, causing severe damage to vital installations. The damaged aircraft, forced to lose altitude and to lag behind the formation, was aggressively attacked by 3 ME-109 aircraft, causing more damage to the aircraft and severely wounding the tail gunner in the upper arm. The radio operator and engineer notified 2d Lt. Kingsley that the tail gunner had been wounded and that assistance was needed to check the bleeding. 2d Lt. Kingsley made {{his way back to the}} radio room, skillfully applied first aid to the wound, and succeeded in checking the bleeding. The <b>tail</b> gunner's <b>parachute</b> harness and heavy clothes were removed and he was covered with blankets, making him as comfortable as possible. Eight ME-109 aircraft again aggressively attacked 2d Lt. Kingsley's aircraft and the ball turret gunner was wounded by 20mm. shell fragments. He went forward to the radio room to have 2d Lt. Kingsley administer first aid. A few minutes later when the pilot gave the order to prepare to bail out, 2d Lt. Kingsley immediately began to assist the wounded gunners in putting on their parachute harness. In the confusion the tail gunner's harness, believed to have been damaged, could not be located in the bundle of blankets and flying clothes which had been removed from the wounded men. With utter disregard for his own means of escape, 2d Lt. Kingsley unhesitatingly removed his parachute harness and adjusted it to the wounded tail gunner. Due to the extensive damage caused by the accurate and concentrated 20mm. fire by the enemy aircraft the pilot gave the order to bail out, as it appeared that the aircraft would disintegrate at any moment. 2d Lt. Kingsley aided the wounded men in bailing out and when last seen by the crewmembers he was standing on the bomb bay catwalk. The aircraft continued to fly on automatic pilot for a short distance, then crashed and burned. His body was later found in the wreckage. 2d Lt. Kingsley by his gallant heroic action was directly responsible for saving the life of the wounded gunner.|$|R

Also, tests were made {{to determine the effect}} on the spin and recovery characteristics of a large radar store, of empty and full external wing tanks, and of an asymmetrical condition when one empty or one full external wing tank is carried. Spin-recovery parachute tests were also performed. The results of the tests indicate that erect spins obtained on the airplane for the normal loading should be satisfactorily terminated by rudder reversal to full against the spin, ailerons moved to with the spin, followed one-half turn later by forward movement of the stick to neutral. With the radar store, with wing tanks empty, or with an asymmetrical condition when one empty tank is on either wing, satisfactory recoveries can be obtained by using the same technique as for the normal loading. Recoveries for the model with a rearward center-of-gravity loading (external wing tanks full) or with a full tank on the wing inboard of the spin axis will be slow to unsatisfactory with rudder reversal to full against the spin followed by brisk forward stick movement. With a full tank on the wing outboard of the spin axis, the recoveries will be satisfactory.
