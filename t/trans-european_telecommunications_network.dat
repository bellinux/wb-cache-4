How to evaluate is a key step for the management of <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> construction. According to the characteristic of <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network,</b> an evaluation system is proposed in this paper. This paper set up a scientific evaluation system for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> based on factor analysis and function point analysis. Through the study found that enhanced KPI index is the most important factor for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network.</b> The evaluation system have played an important significance for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The latest {{generations of}} <b>telecommunications</b> <b>networks</b> have been {{designed}} to deliver higher data rates than widely used second generation <b>telecommunications</b> <b>networks,</b> providing flexible communication capabilities that can deliver high quality video images. However, these new generations of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>networks</b> are interference limited, impairing their performance in cases of heavy traffic and high usage. This limits the services offered by a <b>telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> operator to those that the operator is confident their network can meet the demand for. One way to lift this constraint would be for the mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> operator to obtain the cooperation of a broadcast network operator so that during periods when the demand for the service is too high for the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> to meet, the service can be transferred to the broadcast network. In the United Kingdom the most recent <b>telecommunications</b> <b>networks</b> on the market are third generation UMTS networks while the terrestrial digital broadcast networks are DVB-T networks. This paper proposes a way for UMTS network operators to forecast the traffic associated with high demand services intended to be deployed on the UMTS network and when demand requires to transfer it to a cooperating DVB-T network. The paper aims to justify to UMTS network operators the use of a DVB-T network as a support for a UMTS network by clearly showing how using a DVB-T network to support it can increase the revenue generated by their network...|$|R
