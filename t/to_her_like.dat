They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on." [...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{returned}} to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> people [...] "in a burning house". Worse, anarchists and other radicals {{around the world}} refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she {{returned to}} London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere—which she called [...] "more fascist than the fascists"—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano Vázquez, {{sent a message to}} her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as [...] "our spiritual mother". She called it [...] "the most beautiful tribute I have ever received".|$|E

[...] until the only person still talking was Hepburn. When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her, she asked what was the matter; Hawks {{asked her if she}} was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> that again since she was old friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jenna Bans and {{directed}} by Tom Verica. Edward Ornelas edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, one of them was always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E
500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Like</b> kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E

He said that although his aim was to [...] "make public transport safer for everyone from the train platform, to the bus stop to the mode of transport itself", he would consult women on whether separate carriages would be welcome, after the idea was suggested to him. His statement was condemned by Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, with Cooper stating that Corbyn's plan was [...] "turning the clock back instead of tackling the problem", while Conservative Women's Minister Nicky Morgan said she was [...] "uncomfortable with the idea", it sounding <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> [...] "segregation".|$|E

2500|$|In several interviews, Octavia Butler has {{acknowledged}} that a series of family and life experiences influenced her novel Kindred. Butler’s grandmother worked chopping sugar cane, and did the laundry of her family {{as well as for}} the white family whom she worked for. Butler spent a great deal of her childhood feeling ashamed that her mother was a housemaid. She also resented her mother for allowing her employers to treat her like dirt, talking <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>like</b> she was less than a human being. As she grew older, Butler realized that her mother endured all that disrespect in order to provide for her. This, in turn, inspired her to write a series of female characters—Alice, Sarah, and Dana—whose capacity of endurance and sacrifice in the face of exploitation is heroic. [...] Butler’s work experiences also helped her develop the protagonist of the novel, Dana. Just like Butler, Dana works at a number of jobs--"from blue collar to low grade white collar, clerk typist"—while struggling to become a published writer. Like Dana, when work is hard to come by, Butler goes home, bakes a solitary potato for her daily meal and keeps on writing.|$|E
2500|$|The Big Sister was, {{according}} to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, {{the first thing}} Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators {{when they arrived at}} 2K Marin. The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive words on a page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. [...] " [...] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that’s really the hard challenge that we had with her. Actually in terms of design, there were lots of fun things, like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>like</b> broken wings," [...] Weir recalled. Motion capture sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product. In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal {{of the rest of the}} character.|$|E
