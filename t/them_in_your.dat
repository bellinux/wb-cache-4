500|$|The band is not musically polished. Paul has joked that, if {{they had}} known of the band’s popularity, they might have made [...] "an effort to sing in tune. But it’s hard to {{anticipate}} {{that sort of thing}} when you’re just writing silly songs and recording <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> living room over a weekend.". While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, I could do that, too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less you want <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> community." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Falling Down" [...] is a rock {{song that}} {{features}} [...] "aggressive" [...] guitar and drum lines powered by [...] "bloopy" [...] synths. Bill Lamb of About.com {{noted that the}} song seemed {{to be influenced by}} Avril Lavigne. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the song sounded [...] "suspiciously similar to Pink's 'U + Ur Hand'." [...] The song is set in common time, and has a tempo of 140 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D aerycryllian mode, and Gomez's vocals span from the low note of A3 to high note of D5. It follows the chord progression Dm–C–Dm-C. Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single 4 out of 5 stars, calling the song [...] "catchy" [...] and commending Gomez's [...] "sassy" [...] vocals and its lyrics. Lamb also noted that [...] "The mix leaves in Gomez' [...] occasional breathless delivery that only conveys more immediacy for the song." [...] A CBBC reviewer complimented the song's [...] "catchy lyrics", stating [...] "you will have <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> head for days!" [...] Rob Perez of NocheLatina called the track one of the best on the album. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the song and its lyrics sounded [...] "uninspired." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Griffons have a {{shortened}} snout, {{heat stroke}} {{is not a}} major concern for them as it is with other flat-faced breeds. [...] The breed's shortened muzzle may cause respiratory problems in extreme heat, but overall they tolerate both hot and cold weather well. [...] As with any breed, owners must use common sense and not leave them outdoors without protection from the elements or subject them to rigorous exercise during extreme temperatures, so let <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> house for cool air and some water.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
