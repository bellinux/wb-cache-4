5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> at the officer's command. On each side of <b>the</b> <b>cannon,</b> three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge <b>the</b> <b>cannon,</b> and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> {{disappeared}} from the Caltech campus, having been taken by people posing as contractors, fooling a security guard with a phony work order. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> was not at its normal location outside Fleming House, where it is normally locked to the ground, due to ongoing renovations. The identity of the perpetrators was initially unknown, and there was speculation {{that it had been}} stolen by nearby Harvey Mudd College, who had been responsible for a well-known theft of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> almost twenty years prior.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1994 season, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> and Mariners parted ways, as Seattle {{moved its}} AAA team to nearby Tacoma. <b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> signed an {{affiliation}} {{agreement with the}} Pittsburgh Pirates, which lasted for three seasons. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> became <b>the</b> AAA affiliate of the Chicago White Sox.|$|R
50|$|Despite a Week 1 win in 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> season got ugly quick. At 3-6, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> traded away captain Will Manny and Joe LoCascio to the New York Lizards for Dave Lawson and Chris LaPierre on June 27. On July 14, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> {{announced}} that neither Lawson nor LaPierre would suit {{up for the}} team that season. Dave Lawson informed team officials {{that he would be}} retiring from the league while Chris LaPierre decided not to report to <b>the</b> team.. <b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> finished <b>the</b> season on a six-game losing streak. At 3-11, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> posted <b>the</b> worst record in the league and tied their franchise-worst record from 2001, their inaugural season.|$|R
500|$|The {{public square}} also {{features}} two surplus Civil War era <b>cannons.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>cannons</b> [...] "guard" [...] the eastern {{entrance to the}} Ogle County Courthouse. Both cannons {{were put in place}} sometime between 1898 and 1900. <b>The</b> Columbiad <b>Cannon</b> (<b>the</b> southern most <b>cannon)</b> was cast in 1846 in Boston, Massachusetts. <b>The</b> northern most <b>cannon,</b> <b>the</b> Parrot <b>Cannon,</b> was cast in 1864.|$|R
5|$|Texians dug up <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> {{and mounted}} it on cart wheels. In {{the absence of}} cannonballs, they {{gathered}} metal scraps to fill <b>the</b> <b>cannon.</b> James C. Neill, who had served in an artillery company during the War of 1812, was given command of <b>the</b> <b>cannon.</b> He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, together to form the first artillery company of Texians. A local Methodist minister, W. P. Smith, blessed their activities in a sermon which made frequent reference to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch hole. On {{the top of the}} vent on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> is a flat circular space called the vent field where the charge is lit. If <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E
5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. <b>The</b> <b>cannon</b> soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard <b>the</b> <b>cannon,</b> and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> and laboriously restored it to working condition. <b>The</b> <b>cannon</b> was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>cannon</b> is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E

50|$|Alberta's most {{prominent}} baseball rivalry existed between <b>the</b> Calgary <b>Cannons</b> and Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League. <b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> existed from 1985 to 2002 while the Trappers existed from 1980 to 2004. The rivalry never {{reached the same}} level as it did in other sports, however, and ultimately both teams relocated to the United States (the Trappers to Round Rock, Texas, and <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> to Albuquerque, New Mexico). The Trappers captured four PCL championships during their existence, while <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> won none.|$|R
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
5|$|Solid {{documentary}} evidence of cannon {{appeared in the}} middle east around the 1360s, however some historians consider the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> there to be far earlier.|$|E
5|$|The cannon's fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales {{blacksmith}} Noah Smithwick, <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> {{was abandoned}} after the cart's axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Béxar {{to assist in}} Austin's siege. Smithwick reported that <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick's descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> used in the battle. The Curator of Military History at the Smithsonian Institution verified that Wagner's cannon was a type of small swivel gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner's cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.|$|E
50|$|In the 1999-2000 NBL season, Bruton {{once again}} {{returned}} to coaching, {{this time for}} <b>the</b> Canberra <b>Cannons.</b> Like with <b>the</b> Hobart Devils, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> were in financial difficulty {{at the time and}} their future was looking bleak. The 2002-03 season saw the financial difficulties of <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> reaching boiling point and it was announced their license would be sold. This series of events resulted in Bruton quitting <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> and not following the club in their move to Newcastle as the Hunter Pirates.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2017 Boston <b>Cannons</b> {{season was}} <b>the</b> seventeenth season for <b>the</b> Boston <b>Cannons</b> of Major League Lacrosse. <b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> came {{in trying to}} improve upon their 8-6 record in 2016. Although they were one of seven teams tied upon {{the top of the}} standings with an 8-6 record, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> were one of three teams not given a playoff berth {{following}} tiebreaker procedures.|$|R
50|$|What {{is known}} is that Trask {{displayed}} <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> outside his home for many years. In February 1906, during the Nelson Carnival, one of <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> was removed as a prank from outside {{his house and}} later recovered by the Police. Their last owner, William David Stoney Johnston, bequeathed them to Nelson City Council {{when he died in}} 1999. After restoration, <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> and carriages were given to Council in 2005.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} cannon {{inscribed with}} a {{date of manufacture}} is a bronze cannon. It is dated to 1298 according to an inscription in the 'Phags-pa script. Outside of archaeological finds, appearances of <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> in Chinese art may suggest that <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> was invented {{as early as the}} 12th century. The oldest artistic representation of a cannon is a stone relief sculpture dated to 1128. The sculpture was discovered in 1985 carved in the walls of Cave 149 of the Dazu Rock Carvings in Dazu, Chongqing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> listed in <b>the</b> table above {{a total of}} 29 12-pound cannons were produced, that sank with their ship during transport in 1759. The quality of <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> had from Bernt Anker's ownership been good according to the manager Lars Semb; none of the guns had cracked during testing for 30 years. During Ancher & Wærn's ownership of Moss Jernverk <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> were labelled [...] "AW", while later on [...] "MW" [...] was used. A common inscription on <b>the</b> <b>cannons</b> was [...] "Liberalitate optimi" [...] (by the sovereign's most kind generosity), which pointed to the privileges and the large loan from the state.|$|R
5|$|An {{experimental}} steam cannon guarding Port Royal Sound {{was built}} around 1900, {{in what is}} now Port Royal Plantation. <b>The</b> <b>cannon</b> was fixed but its propulsion system allowed for long range shots for the time.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> {{would be}} cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, <b>the</b> <b>cannon</b> would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Bore: The hollow {{cylinder}} bored down {{the centre of}} <b>the</b> <b>cannon,</b> including {{the base of the}} bore or bottom of the bore, the nearest end of the bore into which the ordnance (wadding, shot, etc.) gets packed. The diameter of the bore represents the cannon's calibre.|$|E

In <b>the</b> trade, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> gave up Connor Gill and Ryan Curtis and in return they acquired Michael Powell, Ben DeFelice, and a 2008 conditional draft choice. After the 2008 season, Powell left lacrosse {{to pursue a career}} as a singer with his band [...] "Villains Trust". <b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> selected Paul Rabil as the first overall pick in the 2008 MLL Draft.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cannons</b> began play in 1985 as the AAA {{affiliate}} of the Seattle Mariners.

[...] Following a 6–2 opening road-trip, Calgary's home opener was scheduled for April 19. [...] It was snowed out, however, as were attempts to play the following two days. On their fourth attempt, <b>the</b> <b>Cannons</b> finally played their first home game on April 22 against the Tucson Toros. [...] Parker threw the ceremonial first pitch out to Calgary's mayor, Ralph Klein.

5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at <b>the</b> <b>Cannon</b> Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for <b>the</b> <b>Cannon</b> alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E
