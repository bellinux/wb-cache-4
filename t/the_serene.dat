25|$|Before {{the coming}} of Europeans to the New World, the area which is now Windsor Terrace was {{inhabited}} by the Canarsee Indians. Specifically, the Gowanus and Werpos tribes inhabited the surrounding area. The land, which was then in the far northwestern corner of the Town of Flatbush, was purchased as a farm by John Vanderbilt. Some parts of the land were also maintained by the Martense family, who owned land in the area through 1895. This area was desirable due to its proximity to downtown Brooklyn, {{as well as the}} recent construction of the Coney Island Plank Road through the area and of <b>the</b> <b>serene</b> Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger's early {{quest for}} a 'total image' {{explains}} the lack of illusory depth, the profuse light, and the refusal to depict a marked difference between the foreground, background and the woman's frame. Metzinger added a conspicuously tropical setting presumably {{under the influence of}} Paul Gauguin's Mahana no atua, Day of the Gods (1894) or Henri (lLe Douanier) Rousseau's Le Rêve (two more painters the artist greatly admired). Bacchante is already typical of Metzinger's style, with its sumptuous textures, sinuous harmony of line (for example the arching trees and foliage), and depiction of <b>the</b> <b>serene</b> attitude and chaste sensuality of the Bacchante's body—all enlisted in Metzinger's {{quest for a}}bsolute perfection.|$|E

500|$|The {{music critic}} Colin Mason {{described}} Bush's music thus: [...] "His range is wide, {{the quality of}} his music consistently excellent.

He is surpassed only in melody, as are the others, by Walton, but not even by him in harmonic richness, nor by Tippett in contrapuntal originality and the expressive power of rather austere musical thought, nor by Rawsthorne in concise, compelling utterance and telling invention, nor by Rubbra in handling large forms well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{monolith}} of Gomateshwara {{commissioned by}} Chavundaraya {{is considered the}} high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka.

It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. Their free standing pillars called Mahasthambha or Bhrahmasthambha are also considered unique, examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar. At the top of the pillar whose shaft (cylindrical or octagonal) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated Brahma and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions.|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{observes that}} in [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] Andersen blended his {{childhood}} {{memories of a}} primitive world of violence, death, and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about <b>the</b> <b>serene,</b> secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept {{him as one of}} their own. Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, [...] "was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly felt as though he did not belong, and longed {{to be a part of}} the upper class. The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the bourgeoisie were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of [...] "The Princess and the Pea", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20mattresses.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{success was}} in the 1670s with Moronobu's paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women. [...] Colour in prints came gradually—at first added by hand for special commissions. [...] By the 1740s, artists such as Masanobu used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour. [...] From the 1760s the success of Harunobu's [...] "brocade prints" [...] led to full-colour production becoming standard, each print made with numerous blocks. [...] Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku that came in the late 18th century. [...] In the 19th century followed a pair of masters best remembered for their landscapes: the bold formalist Hokusai, whose Great Wave off Kanagawa {{is one of the}} best-known works of Japanese art; and <b>the</b> <b>serene,</b> atmospheric Hiroshige, most noted for his series The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō. [...] Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.|$|E
500|$|Late Registration has {{a diverse}} number of collaborations for its {{individual}} tracks. West chose his guest artists {{based on the}} effect each of their voices had on him when he heard them, citing <b>the</b> <b>serene</b> vocals of Adam Levine, the trademark sound of Brandy, and the lyricism of Lupe Fiasco and Paul Wall as primary examples. Adam Levine, lead vocalist of pop rock band Maroon 5 is featured on the album's opening track, [...] "Heard 'Em Say." [...] The two had previously collaborated when Maroon 5 commissioned West to produce a remix for [...] "This Love" [...] and later developed a friendship while sitting together on a flight to Rome for the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards. While playing songs from his second album on his iPod for him during the flight, West came across the demo for [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] to which Levine added a R hook he had recently written and thought was perfect for it. [...] The track was recorded quickly after the 2005 Grammy Awards ceremony, as Levine only {{had a couple of}} free hours available for time in the studio, and Brion was able to translate the two compositions in a matter of hours.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to <b>the</b> <b>serene</b> glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

[...] She further praised the visuals and themes, comparing it to those of director Yasujirō Ozu. In his review for Variety critic Peter Debruge stated that Hosoda's direction [...] "appeals to the hard-to-please teen crowd by taking mind-bending ideas and planting them within a relatable contempo context." [...] He also praised the CG animation in the OZ sequences. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Hosoda's style and said that it [...] "adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that <b>the</b> <b>serene</b> real world seems like a dream state." [...] He also likened Hosoda's style to that of Hayao Miyazaki and Nintendo. Hartlaub complained that Kenji's character is [...] "a bit too over-caffeinated in the first part" [...] {{and concluded that the}} film is [...] "the kind of fun and quirky film that you don't see very often in art houses this time of year." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He stated that [...] "Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments" [...] and also praised Satoko Okudera's writing, stating that it [...] "stakes a claim for the non-virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan’s medieval era." [...] He also praised the OZ animation sequences as [...] "visually ravishing explorations of white-on-white cyberspace, but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé." [...] Burr notes that in the film, [...] "it's what's old that's made to seem refreshingly new." [...] In his review for the New York Post V.A. Musetto gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called the film [...] "great despite its structural problems". Musetto also complained about the storyline, stating that the [...] "sci-fi elements seem silly rather than suspenseful."
