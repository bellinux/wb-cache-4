5|$|Seamounts {{may thus}} be vital {{stopping}} points for some migratory animals, specifically whales. Some recent research indicates whales may use such features as navigational aids throughout their migration. For a long <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been surmised that many pelagic animals visit seamounts as well, to gather food, but {{proof of this}} aggregating effect has been lacking. The first demonstration of this conjecture was published in 2008.|$|E

5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to make a choice, in direction 0 the next <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E

Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having not done so since 2001.|$|E

Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E

5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death.

At the same <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E

5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> been repeatedly suggested that Mandela {{would have preferred to}} develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E

In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
