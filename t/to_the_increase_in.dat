5|$|The Iron Duke-class {{ships were}} 622feet 9inches (189.9metres) long overall, {{and had a}} beam of 90ft (27.4m) and a draught of 29ft (8.8m). This was an {{increase}} of 25ft (7.7m) in length and 1ft (.3m) in width over the preceding King George V-class ships. The Iron Dukes displaced 25,000long tons (25,400tonnes). This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 R-1 had a B-1 {{airframe}} {{with the}} exception of a modification in the fuselage which enabled an additional oil tank. This was installed to feed the engine due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> range after the addition of the extra fuel tanks.|$|E

5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s.

5|$|After {{successful}} test marketing from 1974, John Smith's Bitter {{was distributed}} in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire Bitter. Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer. By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> motor {{traffic in}} the early 20th century, the {{capacity}} of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with preliminary work on the northern approach road. By this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{population}} after protective {{legislation was}} put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was {{made available to the}} public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led to mass {{migration}} to the city; this resulted {{in many areas of}} the city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E
5|$|The P-4 {{contained}} {{many changes}} from the P-2 and P-3. The jettisonable loads {{were capable of}} considerable variation. Two external SC 1800kg (3,960lb) bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC 1,800kg plus four SC 250kg; or one SC 2,500kg external bomb could be carried on an ETC Rüstsatz rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L oil tank could be added {{in place of the}} internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The empty weight of the P-4 increased to 6,775kg (14,936lb), and the full takeoff weight increased to 13,500kg (29,762lb) owing to the mentioned alterations.|$|E

The spatial distributions {{of the differences in}} AOD and clear-sky DSRS were similar, indicating that direct radiation effects resulted in cooling over the major sources of aerosols. However, the changes in clear-sky DSRS due to increased AOD (Fig.  3 c) cannot explain all of the changes in SAT (Fig.  3 b).|$|R
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The town {{began as}} a small {{shipping}} community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and Dover. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after {{the building of a}} pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> foreign travel and to a lesser degree exposure to flooding that has prevented the town's redevelopment.|$|E

This results in the hybrid approach producing a better BER that also degrades slowly {{as a function of}} interference power.|$|R
5|$|With a {{third of}} all town centre {{businesses}} in the leisure industry, Bournemouth has a booming nightlife economy and is a popular destination for stag and hen parties. These party-goers contribute £125 million a year to the economy and support 4,000 jobs. In 2010 the town was awarded a Purple Flag for providing a wide variety of night-time activities while maintaining the safety of both residents and visitors. An independent report published in 2012 indicates there has been a rise in antisocial behaviour which it attributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> nightlife.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War drove up the demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E
