40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a phased drowsy {{instruction}} cache with on-demand wakeup prediction policy (called “phased on-demand policy”) {{to reduce the}} leakage and dynamic energy with less performance overhead. As in prior non-phased on-demand policy, an extra stage for wakeup is inserted before the fetch stage in pipeline. The drowsy cache lines are woken up in wakeup stage and the wakeup latency is overlapped with the fetch latency. Unlike in non-phased on-demand policy, The tag and data array are accessed in two phases. The <b>tag</b> <b>blocks</b> are in active mode {{all the time and}} are accessed in wakeup stage.

Experiments on 9 SPCE 2000 benchmarks show that, compared with prior non-phased on-demand policy, our proposed policy can save 75. 4 % of energy for I-Cache and improve the EDP of whole processor by 6. 9 %.

40|$|Abstract—In radio {{frequency}} identifications (RFIDs), an idle slot can be {{interrupted by the}} reader and takes less time than the other slots. In this case, the widely used binary splitting (BS) protocol is not optimal. M-ary splitting (M> 2) with a carefully selected M outperforms BS, because it can take into account smaller duration of the idle slots. In this paper, we provide optimal value of M (M) for varying slot sizes that yields minimum identification time. The proposed scheme is called optimal splitting (OS). We also revise OS to deal with mobile tags and propose the optimal splitting with arrival <b>tags</b> <b>blocking</b> (OS-ATB) protocol. Extensive simulations show that OS and OS-ATB consistently yield better performance than the other splitting and tree-based schemes. Note to Practitioners — An RFID reader can interrupt the slot in which no tags reply for a predefined time interval, resulting in an short idle slot. In this case, binary splitting {{is not the best}} choice but simple increase of the splitting level can yield much better performance. Since the slot sizes are usually fixed for a given system, the optimum value can be calculated offline without introducing extra computation complexity during the realtime identification. Index Terms—Mobile tags, optimal splitting, {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID), splitting algorithms, tag anticollision. I...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of a low pH environment, the channel-forming T domain of diphtheria toxin undergoes a conformational change that allows for both its own insertion into planar lipid bilayers and the translocation of the toxin's catalytic domain across them. Given that the T domain contributes only three transmembrane segments, and the channel is permeable to ions as large as glucosamine+ and NAD−, {{it would appear that the}} channel must be a multimer. Yet, there is substantial circumstantial evidence that the channel may be formed from a single subunit. To test the hypothesis that the channel formed by the T domain of diphtheria toxin is monomeric, we made mixtures of two T domain constructs whose voltage-gating characteristics differ, and then observed the gating behavior of the mixture's single channels in planar lipid bilayers. One of these constructs contained an NH 2 -terminal hexahistidine (H 6) <b>tag</b> that <b>blocks</b> the channel at negative voltages; the other contained a COOH-terminal H 6 <b>tag</b> that <b>blocks</b> the channel at positive voltages. If the channel is constructed from multiple T domain subunits, one expects to see a population of single channels from this mixture that are blocked at both positive and negative voltages. The observed single channels were blocked at either negative or positive voltages, but never both. Therefore, we conclude that the T domain channel is monomeric...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Embedded {{languages}} {{have been}} used to support compositional descriptions for various domains. In this paper, we look at the domain of paper folding, or Origami-based geometry, in which sequences of paper folding are used to describe points and lines on the plane. Based on seven basic origami axioms, we design and develop an embedded domain specific language for the descriptions of such constructions in Haskell. We argue that the embedded language approach, that is composing a model using the basic constructors in the domain specific language, gives a compositional and concise way to describe Origami models. We look into analysis, manipulation and generation of origami models using this approach, including textual explanations of models, analysis of models to discover inherent preconditions (or constraints) in a description and basic animation of the folding of a model. Finally, we look into the <b>tagging</b> of <b>blocks</b> within a construction, enabling different evaluations at various levels of abstraction according to the user’s knowledge of Origami. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose the}} use of “selective {{blocking}} ” by “blocker tags ” {{as a way of}} protecting consumers from unwanted scanning of RFID tags attached to items they may be carrying or wearing. While an ordinary RFID tag is a simple, cheap (e. g. five-cent) passive device intended as an “electronic bar-code ” for use in supply-chain management, a blocker tag is a cheap passive RFID device that can simulate many ordinary RFID tags simultaneously. When carried by a consumer, a blocker tag thus “blocks ” RFID readers. It can do so universally by simulating all possible RFID tags. Or a blocker <b>tag</b> can <b>block</b> selectively by simulating only selected subsets of ID codes, such as those by a particular manufacturer, or those in a designated “privacy zone. ” We believe that this approach, when used with appropriate care, provides a very attractive alternative for addressing privacy concerns raised by the potential (and likely) widespread use of RFID tags in consumer products.

40|$|SummaryThe {{cylindrical}} Hsp 100 chaperone ClpA mediates ATP-dependent {{unfolding of}} substrate proteins bearing “tag” sequences, {{such as the}} 11 -residue ssrA sequence appended to proteins translationally stalled at ribosomes. Unfolding is coupled to translocation through a central channel into the associating protease, ClpP. To explore the topology and mechanism of ClpA action, we carried out chemical crosslinking and functional studies. Whereas a tag from RepA protein crosslinked proximally to the flexible N domains, the ssrA sequence in GFP-ssrA crosslinked distally in the channel to {{a segment of the}} distal ATPase domain (D 2). Single substitutions placed in this D 2 loop, and also in two apparently cooperating proximal (D 1) loops, abolished binding of ssrA substrates and unfolded proteins lacking <b>tags</b> and <b>blocked</b> unfolding of GFP-RepA. Additionally, a substitution adjoining the D 2 loop allowed binding of ssrA proteins but impaired their translocation. This loop, as in homologous nucleic-acid translocases, may bind substrates proximally and, coupled with ATP hydrolysis, translocate them distally, exerting mechanical force that mediates unfolding...|$|R

40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage. However, excessive activity of PARP- 1 exacerbates brain injury via NAD+ depletion and energy failure. The purpose of this study was to determine if tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) covering multiple regions of the PARP- 1 gene are related to outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. DNA from 191 adult patients with severe TBI was assayed for four tSNPs corresponding to haplotype blocks spanning the PARP- 1 gene. Categorization as favorable or poor outcome was based on Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assigned at 6 months. PARP- 1 enzyme activity was indirectly evaluated by quantifying poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) -modified proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and gender, the AA genotype of SNP rs 3219119 was an independent predictor of favorable neurologic outcome. This SNP <b>tags</b> a haplotype <b>block</b> spanning the automodification and catalytic domains of the PARP- 1 gene. SNP rs 2271347 correlated with CSF PAR-modified protein level. This SNP, which did not correlate with outcome, <b>tags</b> a haplotype <b>block</b> spanning the promoter region of the PARP- 1 gene. We conclude that after severe TBI in humans, a PARP- 1 polymorphism within the automodification-catalytic domain is associated with neurological outcome, while a polymorphism within the promoter region was associated with CSF PAR-modified protein level. These findings must be replicated in a prospective study before the relevance of PARP- 1 polymorphisms after TBI can be established...|$|R
