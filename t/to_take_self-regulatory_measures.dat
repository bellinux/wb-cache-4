40|$|Most {{models of}} {{voluntary}} self-regulatory actions designed to preempt environmental regulations assume certainty regarding {{the likelihood of}} the regulatory threat. We examine industry voluntary self-regulatory behavior under uncertainty of two sorts: first, the likelihood that an advocacy group triggers legislative action, and second, the likelihood that legislation passes once a legislative proposal has been put forward. We find that increasing the uncertainty of either type can decrease or increase self-regulatory actions. The latter result calls into question conventional wisdom, which suggests that a strong and credible regulatory threat is needed to induce industry <b>to</b> <b>take</b> voluntary <b>self-regulatory</b> actions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine whether children would benefit from a feedforward self-modeling (FSM) video and to explore possible explanatory mechanisms for the potential benefits, using a self-regulation framework. To this end, children were involved in learning two five-skill trampoline routines. For one of the routines, a FSM video was provided during acquisition, whereas only verbal instructions were provided for the alternate routine. The FSM involved editing video footage such that it showed the learner performing the trampoline routine at a higher skill level than their current capability. Analyses of the data showed that while physical performance benefits were observed for the routine that was learned with the FSM video, no differences were obtained in relation to the <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures.</b> Thus, the FSM video enhanced motor skill acquisition, but this could not be explained by changes to the varied self-regulatory processes examined...|$|R

The results showed the existence of positive bivariate correlations between all <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> and adherence to recommended health behaviours, but multiple regression analysis identified self-discipline {{to be the most important}} direct predictor of health behaviour. Furthermore, positive correlations were observed between all types of self-regulatory resources and well-being, while self-control and future orientation were identified as the strongest direct predictors of well-being. Interestingly, increased adherence to dietary recommendations directly influenced well-being in a negative way.

These guidelines reflect DMA’s long-standing policy of high levels of ethics and {{the responsibility of the}} Association, its members, and all marketers to maintain consumer and community relationships that are based on fair and ethical principles. In addition to providing general guidance to the industry, the Guidelines for Ethical Business Practice are used by DMA’s Committee on Ethical Business Practice, an industry peer review committee, as the standard to which direct marketing promotions that are the subject of complaint to DMA are compared.

All marketers should support the guidelines in spirit and not treat their provisions as obstacles to be circumvented by legal ingenuity. These guidelines also represent DMA’s general philosophy that <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> are preferable to governmental mandates. Self-regulatory actions are more readily adaptable to changing techniques and economic and social conditions. They encourage widespread use of sound business practices.

40|$|The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers has {{generally}} been lauded as a system of self-regulation that offers the advantages of speed, flexibility and low cost administration by experts. Many of its provisions are uncontroversial and do indeed reflect a consensus view about {{the way in which}} takeovers should be carried out. However, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition on defensive measures by management {{in the event of a}} takeover is far more controversial. This article argues that the City Code – and the prohibition on defensive measures in particular - was introduced because the common law had demonstrated itself incapable of putting in place a system of takeover regulation that ensured the takeover remained a viable means of ensuring managerial accountability to shareholders. Its introduction in 1968 fundamentally transformed the UK 2 ̆ 7 s system of corporate governance. Through its prohibition on defensive measures once a takeover becomes imminent, the Code truncates the general management discretion that lies at the heart of company law and forces management to focus on the generation of short-term shareholder value. What is striking is that this fundamental reorientation of the way in which companies are controlled was brought about not by an Act of Parliament but by a <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> put in place by financial institutions. Following the implementation of the Takeover Directive, which itself was heavily influenced by the City Code, the Companies Act 2006 now requires the Takeover Panel to maintain that prohibition...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{is a complex}} and evolving practice. The rise of sexual discrimination in cyberspace {{is only one of}} the most recent and most striking examples of the phenomenon 2 ̆ 7 s increasing complexity. Sexual harassment law, however, has not kept pace with this evolution. Discrimination law has not been adequately 2 ̆ 2 updated 2 ̆ 2 to address new and amplified practices of sex discrimination. Its two principal limitations are (1) it treats only sexual harassment that occurs in certain protected settings (e. g. the workplace or school) as actionable and (2) it assumes that both the activity and the resulting harm of sexual harassment occur in the same protected setting. Thus, it is unable to address any harassment that occurs completely or partially outside of traditionally protected settings. By contrast, this Article proposes a 2 ̆ 2 multiple-setting 2 ̆ 2 conception of sexual harassment that both moves beyond traditionally protected settings and explicitly acknowledges that sexual harassment in one setting can produce harms in another. In order to address multiple-setting harassment, a third-party liability regime similar to that of traditional sexual harassment law should be introduced into nontraditional contexts. In the particular case of online harassment, liability should attach to website operators. This regime will create an incentive for website operators to adopt preemptive, <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> against online sexual harassment, much as employers have done in the offline setting...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{negative}} effects on Internet consumers, the divulgence of personal {{information to the public}} has been reported {{as one of the most}} serious infringements on consumer rights. Both consumers and sellers around the world have sought to come up with an optimal solution for information privacy. Several incompatible characteristics of regulating consumer privacy in e-commerce between the U. S. and Korea were explored, and curative suggestions were made to establish a new legal framework to protect online consumer privacy. First, Korea’s regulations for protecting online consumer privacy were found to be centrally controlled, while the U. S. authorities have encouraged self-regulation. Considering the long run efficiency of self-regulation, the Korean authorities should seek more <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> and establish consensus among the businesses to voluntarily protect consumer online privacy. Second, U. S. regulations on protection of online consumer privacy are for the most part commercially oriented and controlled by the FTC, whereas in Korea, an administrative department, the Ministry of Information and Communication, regulates online consumer privacy as a primary authority, resulting in lack of specialization in the matters of consumer protection. To improve the efficiency and specialization in regulation of online consumer privacy in Korea, it would be necessary to promulgate a directive specially designed for protecting consumer privacy and delegating the regulatory power to the Korea Consumer Protection Agency established by the Consumer Protection Act. Finally, international arbitration is recommended as the best tool to resolve and prevent the intricacies of international litigation brought against violation of online consumer privacy...|$|R
40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{amended the}} Commodity Exchange Act and adopted an {{explicit}} prohibition regarding activity {{commonly known as}} spoofing in commodities markets. This Note argues that the spoofing prohibition is a necessary step towards improved market discipline and price integrity in the relevant commodities markets. It fills an important gap in the CEA in relation to an elusive form of price manipulation activity by providing an explicit statutory authority on which regulators and market operators may rely in policing suspect trading strategies falling under the spoofing umbrella. Congress’ explicit denouncement of spoofing as an illegal act has ramifications not only for traders, but also for brokers and market makers. In the past, when courts have considered the issue of secondary liability of brokers regarding manipulative activity of their customers {{in the context of}} wash sales, they have determined the CEA’s explicit prohibition of wash sales and the relatively easier identification of wash sales activity as important factors that may potentially increase the secondary liability risk of derivatives brokers. Applying the same analogy to spoofing, greater public awareness and the increasing visibility of spoofing activity (resulting from improvements in the monitoring systems of regulators and market operators) will provide strong incentives for market participants to adapt to changing norms. However, areas of concern, such as risk of selective enforcement and inconsistencies among the applicable market rules, will pose challenges in the spoofing prohibition’s implementation. Therefore, regulators must seek cooperation with relevant market operators to encourage structural reform and <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures,</b> such as implementation of appropriate structural safeguards into the trading infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Background: The adverse {{relation}} between dietary {{trans fatty acid}} (TFA) intake and coronary artery disease risk is well established. Many countries in the European Union (EU) and worldwide have implemented different policies to reduce the TFA intake of their populations. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the added value of EU-level action by estimating the cost-effectiveness of 3 possible EU-level policy measures to reduce population dietary TFA intake. This was calculated against a reference situation of not implementing any EU-level policy (i. e., by assuming only national or <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures).</b> Design: We developed a mathematical model to compare different policy options at the EU level: 1) to do nothing beyond the current state (reference situation), 2) to impose mandatory TFA labeling of prepackaged foods, 3) to seek voluntary agreements toward further reducing industrially produced TFA (iTFA) content in foods, and 4) to impose a legislative limit for iTFA content in foods. Results: The model indicated that to impose an EU-level legal limit or to make voluntary agreements may, over the course of a lifetime (85 y), avoid the loss of 3. 73 and 2. 19 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), respectively, and save > 51 and 23 billion euros when compared with the reference situation. Implementing mandatory TFA labeling can also avoid the loss of 0. 98 million DALYs, but this option incurs more costs than it saves compared with the reference option. Conclusions: The model indicates that there is added value of an EU-level action, either via a legal limit or through voluntary agreements, with the legal limit option producing the highest additional health benefits. Introducing mandatory TFA labeling for the EU common market may provide some additional health benefits; however, this would likely not be a cost-effective strategy. JRC.

40|$|The {{development}} and market introduction of ion-specific sensors, like the {{ion selective electrode}} (ISE) and ion selective field effect transistor (ISFET) sensor, has {{paved the way for}} completely new systems for application of fertilisers to crops in greenhouses. This paper illustrates the usefulness of these sensors, by elaborating on a new fertigation strategy in greenhouses aiming at less pollution, more efficient use of fertilisers and eventually, crop quality control. The basic idea of this strategy is to keep the concentration of the individual ions in the drainage water of a set of plants constant at a level that is non-limiting to ion-transport and nutrient uptake. In this way, the uptake of ions by the plants is intrinsically compensated for, thus, satisfying the demand of the plant by exploiting its <b>self-regulatory</b> behaviour. <b>Measuring</b> ion concentrations also enables the design of even more advanced feedback-controlled nutrient dispensers, functioning {{on the basis of a}} model-based control strategy that uses sensors connected to the plant...|$|R
40|$|A {{host state}} {{has become a}} victim of “fair and {{equitable}} treatment” investment standard offered to the foreign investment protection. Foreign investment dissatisfied with host state legitimate public measures affecting their investment demand FET protection alleging investment protection violation. Foreign investors strong pitching for FET standard protection subordinating every sovereign host state regulatory action is creating friction between the parties. While host state insists non-discriminatory police power inherited in FET regulation for public measures, in contrast, foreign investors demand absolute protection of foreign investment. Emerging and developing host country were early targets of foreign investment. A capital export from developed source state to emerging and developing host state is not anymore unidirectional but bidirectional. The investment from emerging and developing economies to developed countries are in rapid increase. Earlier emerging and developing host country were in voracious attack from established source state foreign investors. These suffering host states were fighting for their sovereign rights to regulate for public protection and interests, however, no to avail. Developed source state supporting implicitly for their investor’s investment protection became a victim of themselves. Rules applied to other became a loop to themselves whom they are now fighting to defend host state administrative rights for the public purpose. The absolute FET has become more fickle {{and in a way}} of balancing stage recognising outstanding and value of regulatory rights in FET. My dissertation explores on the same line that FET protection standard for foreign investors and their investment is reciprocal to host state just and equitable regulatory public measures. Host state non-discriminatory measures are non-compensable and legitimate of sovereign rights when public protection and security demands. This adduces long believed and practiced host state necessary steps of domestic law and order. It is evidence by Modern Model BIT, in arbitration practices and even developed source states opposing absolute FET standard protection. These methods proved that predatory nature of alleging FET violations are not only harming host country but also negativity in foreign investors and their investment. The future is not about only host state rights regulatory measures but also foreign investors and their investment <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> like corporate social responsibility...|$|R

Nevertheless they have done so in contrasting ways and the resulting governance modes for assisted reproductive technology (ART) and embryonic stem-cell research vary greatly. Instead of imposing their steering capacity in a ‘top-down’ fashion, governments have <b>taken</b> pre-existing <b>self-regulatory</b> arrangements in the field into account and built up governance mechanisms in conjunction with private actors and pre-existing modes of private governance.
