50|$|Mice: Among vertebrates, it {{is known}} that mammals are endotherms that are capable of homeostatic thermoregulation. Mice have been shown to have some <b>thermosensitivity</b> within the SCN, {{although}} the regulation of body temperature by mice experiencing hypothermia is more sensitive to whether they are in a bright or dark environment; {{it has been shown that}} mice in darkened conditions and experiencing hypothermia maintain a stable internal body temperature, even while fasting. In light conditions, mice showed a drop in body temperature under the same fasting and hypothermic conditions. Through analyzing genetic expression of Clock genes in wild-type and knockout strains, as well as analyzing the activity of neurons within the SCN and connections to proximate nuclei of the hypothalamus in the aforementioned conditions, it has been shown that the SCN is the center of control for circadian body temperature rhythm. This circadian control, thus, includes both direct and indirect influence of many of the thermoregulatory behaviors that mammals engage in to maintain homeostasis.|$|E

Respirometry {{was carried out in}} an open-top static system and RMR corrected for seawater–atmosphere O 2 exchange using mass-balance equations. For both species RMR increased linearly with increasing temperature (T). RMR for mulloway was 5. 78 T − 29. 0 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1 and for yellowtail kingfish was 12. 11 T − 39. 40 mg O 2 kg− 0. 8 h− 1. The factorial difference in RMR between mulloway and yellowtail kingfish ranged from 2. 8 to 2. 2 depending on temperature. The energetic cost of routine activity can be described as a function of temperature for mulloway as 1. 93 T − 9. 68 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1 and for yellowtail kingfish as 4. 04 T − 13. 14 kJ kg− 0. 8 day− 1. Over the full range of temperatures tested Q 10 values were approximately 2 for both species while Q 10 responses at each temperature increment varied considerably with mulloway and yellowtail kingfish displaying <b>thermosensitivities</b> indicative of each species respective niche habitat. RMR for mulloway was least thermally dependent at 28. 5 °C and for yellowtail kingfish at 22. 8 °C.

40|$|Preoptic–anterior {{hypothalamic}} (PO/AH) neurones {{sense and}} regulate body temperature. Although controversial, {{it has been}} postulated that warm-induced depolarization determines neuronal <b>thermosensitivity.</b> Supporting this hypothesis, recent studies suggest that temperature-sensitive cationic channels (e. g. vanilloid receptor TRP channels) constitute the underlying mechanism of neuronal <b>thermosensitivity.</b> Moreover, earlier studies indicated that PO/AH neuronal warm sensitivity is due to depolarizing sodium currents that are sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). To test these possibilities, intracellular recordings were made in rat hypothalamic tissue slices. Thermal effects on membrane potentials and currents were compared in PO/AH warm-sensitive, temperature-insensitive and silent neurones. All three types of neurones displayed slight depolarization during warming and hyperpolarization during cooling. There {{were no significant differences}} in membrane potential <b>thermosensitivity</b> for the different neuronal types. Voltage clamp recordings (at − 92 mV) measured the thermal effects on persistent inward cationic currents. In all neurones, resting holding currents decreased during cooling and increased during warming, and there was no correlation between firing rate <b>thermosensitivity</b> and current <b>thermosensitivity.</b> To determine the thermosensitive contribution of persistent, TTX-sensitive currents, voltage clamp recordings were conducted in the presence of 0. 5 μm TTX. TTX decreased the current <b>thermosensitivity</b> in most neurones, but there were no resulting differences between the different neuronal types. The present study found no evidence of a resting ionic current that is unique to warm-sensitive neurones.

40|$|Hypoxia is {{well known}} to reduce the body {{temperature}} (Tb) of mammals, although the neural origins of this response remain uncertain. Short-term hypoxic exposure causes {{a reduction in the}} lower critical temperature of the thermal neutral zone and a reduction in whole body thermal conductance of rodents, providing indirect support that hypoxia lowers Tb in a regulated manner. In this study, we examined directly the potential for changes in central <b>thermosensitivity</b> to evoke the hypoxic metabolic response by heating and cooling the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (the area which integrates thermoreceptor input and regulates thermoeffector outputs) using chronic, indwelling thermodes in ground squirrels during normoxia and hypoxia (7, 10 and 12 % O 2). We found that the threshold hypothalamic temperature for the metabolic response to cooling (Tth) of ∼ 38 °C in normoxia was proportionately reduced in hypoxia (down to 28 – 31 °C at 7 % O 2) and that the metabolic <b>thermosensitivity</b> (α; the change in metabolic rate for any given change in hypothalamic temperature below the lower critical temperature) was comparatively reduced by 5 to 9 times. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that the fall in temperature that occurs during hypoxia {{is the result of a}} reduction in the activation of thermogenic mechanisms. The decrease in the central <b>thermosensitivity</b> in hypoxia, however, appears to be a critical factor in the alteration of mammalian Tb.

The level of secretion of a major pathogenic factor, intermedilysin, was not affected by dnaK mutation. We further examined the function and property of the S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system by using Escherichia coli ΔdnaK and ΔrpoH mutant strains. S. intermedius DnaK could not complement the <b>thermosensitivity</b> of E. coli ΔdnaK mutant.

The S. intermedius DnaK chaperone system was also able to efficiently eliminate the aggregated proteins from ΔrpoH mutant cells.

Moloney murine sarcoma virus MuSVts 110 shows a similar balance between unspliced and spliced RNAs, differing only in that the splicing of its RNA is, in addition, growth temperature sensitive. We have generated N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) -treated MuSVts 110 revertants in which splicing was virtually complete at all temperatures and have investigated the molecular basis of this reversion {{on the assumption that}} the findings would reveal cis-acting elements controlling MuSVts 110 splicing <b>thermosensitivity.</b> In a representative revertant (NMU- 20), we found that complete splicing was conferred by a G-to-A substitution generating a consensus branchpoint (BP) signal (-CCCUGGC- to -CCCUGAC- [termed G(- 25) A]) at - 25 relative to the 3 ' ss. Weakening this BP to -CCCGAC- [G(- 25) A,U(- 27) C] moderately reduced splicing at the permissive temperature and sharply inhibited splicing at the originally nonpermissive temperature, arguing that MuSVts 110 splicing <b>thermosensitivity</b> depends on a suboptimal BP-U 2 small nuclear RNA interaction. This conclusion was supported by results indicating that lengthening the short MuSVts 110 polypyrimidine tract and altering its uridine content doubled splicing efficiency at permissive temperatures and nearly abrogated splicing <b>thermosensitivity.</b> In vitro splicing experiments showed that MuSVts 110 G(- 25) A RNA intermediates were far more efficiently ligated than RNAs carrying the wild-type BP, the G(- 25) A,U (- 27) C BP, or the extended polypyrimidine tract. The efficiency of ligation in vitro roughly paralleled splicing efficiency in vivo [G(- 25) A BP > extended polypyrimidine tract > G(- 25) A,U(- 27) C BP > wild-type BP]. These results suggest that MuSVts 110 RNA splicing is balanced by cis elements similar to those operating in other retroviruses and, in addition, that its splicing <b>thermosensitivity</b> is a response to the presence of multiple suboptimal splicing signals...|$|E
40|$|The current thesis {{examined}} whether sex-differences {{in local}} and whole-body heat loss are evident after accounting for confounding differences in physical characteristics {{and rate of}} metabolic heat production. Three experimental studies were performed: the first examined whole-body heat loss in males and females matched for body mass and surface area during exercise at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production; the second examined local and whole-body heat loss responses between sexes during exercise at increasing requirements for heat loss; the third examined sex-differences in local sweating and cutaneous vasodilation to given doses of pharmacological agonists, as well as during passive heating. The first study demonstrates that females exhibit a lower whole-body sudomotor <b>thermosensitivity</b> (553 ± 77 vs. 795 ± 85 W•°C- 1, p= 0. 05) during exercise performed at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production.

In this experiment, changes in the vascular tone of the hands and feet were mapped to demonstrate the separate and combined influences of mean body and local skin temperature changes. Methods Eight males participated in three trials. Three pre-experimental conditions were established via water immersion (oesophageal temperatures: 36. 1, 37. 0, 38. 5 °C), with core and mean skin temperatures then clamped (water-perfusion garment) whilst five thermal treatments were applied to the right hand and left foot (5, 15, 25, 33, 40 °C). This yielded 15 thermal combinations under which hand and foot blood flows were measured (displacement plethysmography). Results Lower volume-specific blood flows were observed at the foot for almost all temperature combinations. When thermoneutral and moderately hyperthermic, the cutaneous <b>thermosensitivity</b> of the hand was significantly greater: thermoneutral: 0. 2 vs. 0. 1 (foot) mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 °C− 1 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05); moderate hyperthermia: 0. 4 vs. 0. 2 (foot) mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 °C− 1 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The hand was 13 times more responsive to core temperature elevations than an equivalent local skin temperature change. For the foot, this <b>thermosensitivity</b> differed by a factor of 26. Conclusion These observations identified the hands as heat radiators, with the feet resisting heat loss, and reinforce the dominance of central thermal feedback, particularly in controlling foot blood flow. However, <b>thermosensitivity</b> to local skin temperature changes was highly plastic, site-specific and dictated by thermal and regional variations in vaso- and venoconstrictor tone...|$|E

40|$|The {{lethal effect}} of an Escherichia coli pgsA null mutation, which causes a {{complete}} lack of the major acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, is alleviated {{by a lack of}} the major outer membrane lipoprotein encoded by the lpp gene, but an lpp pgsA strain shows a thermosensitive growth defect. Using transposon mutagenesis, we found that this <b>thermosensitivity</b> was suppressed by disruption of the rcsC, rcsF, and yojN genes, which code for a sensor kinase, accessory positive factor, and phosphotransmitter, respectively, of the Rcs phosphorelay signal transduction system initially identified as regulating the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes. Disruption of the rcsB gene coding for the response regulator of the system also suppressed the <b>thermosensitivity,</b> whereas disruption of cpsE did not. By monitoring the expression of a cpsB′-lac fusion, we showed that the Rcs system is activated in the pgsA mutant and is reverted to a wild-type level by the rcs mutations. These results indicate that envelope stress due to an acidic phospholipid deficiency activates the Rcs phosphorelay system and thereby causes the thermosensitive growth defect independent of the activation of capsule synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Both prokaryotic and {{eukaryotic}} cells contain multiple {{heat shock}} protein 40 (Hsp 40) and {{heat shock protein}} 70 (Hsp 70) proteins, which cooperate as molecular chaperones to ensure fidelity at all stages of protein biogenesis. The Hsp 40 signature domain, the J-domain, is required for binding of an Hsp 40 to a partner Hsp 70, and may {{also play a role}} in the specificity of the association. Through the creation of chimeric Hsp 40 proteins by the replacement of the J-domain of a prokaryotic Hsp 40 (DnaJ), we have tested the functional equivalence of J-domains from a number of divergent Hsp 40 s of mammalian and parasitic origin (malarial Pfj 1 and Pfj 4, trypanosomal Tcj 3, human ERj 3, ERj 5, and Hsj 1, and murine ERj 1). An in vivo functional assay was used to test the functionality of the chimeric proteins on the basis of their ability to reverse the <b>thermosensitivity</b> of a dnaJ cbpA mutant Escherichia coli strain (OD 259). The Hsp 40 chimeras containing J-domains originating from soluble (cytosolic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -lumenal) Hsp 40 s were able to reverse the <b>thermosensitivity</b> of E. coli OD 259. In all cases, modified derivatives of these chimeric proteins containing an His to Gln substitution in the HPD motif of the J-domain were unable to reverse the <b>thermosensitivity</b> of E. coli OD 259. This suggested that these J-domains exerted their in vivo functionality through a specific interaction with E. coli Hsp 70, DnaK. Interestingly, a Hsp 40 chimera containing the J-domain of ERj 1, an integral membrane-bound ER Hsp 40, was unable to reverse the <b>thermosensitivity</b> of E. coli OD 259, suggesting that this J-domain was unable to functionally interact with DnaK. Substitutions of conserved amino acid residues and motifs were made in all four helices (I-IV) and the loop regions of the J-domains, and the modified chimeric Hsp 40 s were tested for functionality using the in vivo assay. Substitution of a highly conserved basic residue in helix II of the J-domain was found to disrupt in vivo functionality for all the J-domains tested. We propose that helix II and the HPD motif of the J-domain represent the fundamental elements of a binding surface required for the interaction of Hsp 40 s with Hsp 70 s, and that this surface has been conserved in mammalian, parasitic and bacterial systems. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the main}} of thermosensitive {{polymeric}} materials, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergoes volume changes {{in response to}} external temperature changes. While in some potential applications, a fast response rate is needed. In this article, effect of the initiator on <b>thermosensitivity</b> of PNIPAM hydrogels was carried out. The characterization of the resulting hydrogels was gravimetrically measured, and the result displays that with increasing the initiator dosage, much faster deswelling rate and much faster shrinking/swelling dynamic response are obtained...|$|E
40|$|Thermosensitive {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} replication-defective mutants have been {{isolated}} {{by using an}} autoradiographic selection method. The mutants have been analyzed genetically and biochemically. Some of the mutants show <b>thermosensitivity</b> of in vitro deoxyribonucleic acid replication. These can be classified into three groups according to their behavior in in vitro complementation assays. This classification is congruent with that obtained by genetic mapping by using cotransduction frequencies with selected markers in P 1 transduction analysis...|$|E
40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) is {{an enzyme}} that initiates the secondary antibody diversification events of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). AID {{is expressed in}} activated B lymphocytes and deaminates cytidines to uridines, thus introducing mutations and/or double-strand breaks throughout the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus. Although AID activity is mostly targeted to the Ig locus, it mutates many other genes at lower rates and this off-target activity induces genomic lesions leading to transformation of B cells. The structure of AID has not been solved, which is partially the reason that several important questions remain unanswered about its mechanism of action. Our lab has recently shown that AID from different species has disparate rates of deamination, and that the deamination rate of AID from each species is thermosensitive, such that fish AID are cold-adapted relative to human AID. Here, we have measured the activity of purified AID from human, zebrafish, channel catfish, pufferfish (takifugu), and hybrid AID containing {{various parts of the}} aforementioned, over a wide range and fine increments of temperatures. Our aim was to elucidate the relationship between <b>thermosensitivity</b> of AID and its primary structure, by identifying region(s) and/or residue(s) within the enzyme that affect <b>thermosensitivity.</b> We found that this characteristic is mostly determined by the C-terminus in the sense that swapping this region resulted in transferring <b>thermosensitivity</b> patterns from the donor enzyme. We also found that AID activity is not always optimal at native physiological temperature, such that human AID is optimal at 32 °C instead of 37 °C. Based on our data, we postulated that this finding may have implications for evolution of AID. Overall, our work has shed light on mechanistic features of AID as well as aspects on its evolution...|$|E
