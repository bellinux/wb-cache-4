2500|$|Fw 190 F-8/U3 — heavy torpedo bomber was {{outfitted}} with an ETC 502, which {{allowed it to}} carry one BT-1400 heavy torpedo (...) [...] Owing {{to the size of}} the torpedo, the U3's <b>tail</b> <b>gear</b> needed to be lengthened. The U3 also was fitted with the 2,000PS BMW 801S engine, and the tail from the Ta 152.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the complex, failure-prone fuselage mounted main gear legs of the earlier Fw 159, {{one of the main}} features of the Fw 190 was its wide-tracked, inwards-retracting landing gear. They were designed to withstand a sink rate of 4.5 meters per second (15 feet per second, 900 feet per minute), double the strength factor usually required. Hydraulic wheel brakes were used. [...] The wide-track landing gear produced better ground handling characteristics, and the Fw 190 suffered fewer ground accidents than the Bf 109. (The Bf 109's narrow-track, outwards-retracting landing gear hinged on its wing root structure to help lower weight, but this led to inherent weakness and many failures and ground loops.) The Fw 190's retractable <b>tail</b> <b>gear</b> used a cable, anchored to the [...] "elbow" [...] at the midpoint of the starboard maingear's transverse retraction arms, which ran aftwards within the fuselage to the vertical fin to operate the tailwheel retraction function. The tailwheel's retraction mechanical design possessed a set of pulleys to guide the aforementioned cable {{to the top of the}} tailwheel's oleo strut, pulling it upwards along a diagonal track within the fin, into the lower fuselage — this mechanism was accessible through prominently visible twin triangular-shaped hinged panels, one per side, in the fin's side sheetmetal covering. On some versions of the Fw 190 an extended oleo strut could be fitted for larger-sized loads (such as bombs or even a torpedo) beneath the fuselage.|$|E

5000|$|Sōji Mitsuka is an {{ordinary}} high school boy {{who has an}} obsession for twintail hair. One day he encounters a mysterious girl named Twoearle, who is from a parallel world, when monsters appear in his town and declare that all twintails in the world belong to them. These monsters feed off [...] "attribute power", the spiritual energy of humans. Twoearle entrusted Sōji with <b>Tail</b> <b>Gear,</b> imaginary armor initiated by powerful twintail attributes. With the armor, Sōji transforms into Tail Red, a twintail warrior (tsuinteiruzu kankei-sha), to protect Earth.|$|E

25|$|As the Type 90-3 {{showed little}} {{improvement}} over the Type 14-2 from which it was developed, in 1931, Yokosuka developed the further refined Type 14-3 Reconnaissance aircraft, with a new <b>tail,</b> a <b>geared</b> Lorraine-Dietrich 3 engine and significantly improved performance.|$|R
40|$|A failed <b>Tail</b> <b>Gear</b> Box (TGB) housing of a {{helicopter}} was analyzed. Analysis showed that the gearbox failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks initiated at the mounting lugs and propagated by low cycle fatigue. There were no metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities associated with fatigue crack initiation. Fatigue appears to be stress related. The possibility of excessive load/vibration on the TGB housings in question may be examined...|$|E

40|$|Strains were {{monitored}} for NALLA 2 Structural components at critical locations : 60 {{locations for}} wing, 50 for fuselage, 6 each for horizontal tail, vertical <b>tail,</b> landing <b>gear</b> and nose gear and 20 locations for wing fuselage joint. While the wing fuselage joint was tested upto the ultimate load, {{the rest of}} the components were loaded upto the limit load only. The measured strains have proved the linear behaviour upto the limit Load, with zero yield, validating the structural integrity, of the components...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{conditions}} was that {{the design of the}} Bf 108 would be used for the new aircraft. This created substantial difficulties. To speed up the project both the wings and the fuselage were based on already-built Kl 107 components. Since the fuselage was too short, Bucher extended it at the tail with a welded tubular steel framework covered with sheet metal, which also housed the <b>tail</b> landing <b>gear.</b> The wings were widened at the root and moved forward in order to accommodate additional fuel tanks, which replaced the two rear seats.|$|R
2500|$|In 1935 Boeing {{designed}} a four-engine airliner {{based on its}} B-17 heavy bomber (Boeing Model 299), then in development, calling it the Model 307. It combined the wings, <b>tail,</b> rudder, landing <b>gear,</b> and engines from their production B-17C with a new, circular cross-section fuselage of [...] diameter, designed to allow pressurization.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} get the promised {{performance}} out of the aircraft, the design included a number of drag-reducing features. On the simple end was a well-faired cockpit, the absence of struts and other drag-inducing supports on the <b>tail.</b> The landing <b>gear</b> (including the tailwheel) was retractable and completely enclosed in flight.|$|R
50|$|The Su-47 is {{of similar}} {{dimensions}} to previous large Sukhoi fighters, {{such as the}} Su-35. To reduce development costs, the Su-47 borrowed the forward fuselage, vertical <b>tails,</b> and landing <b>gear</b> of the Su-27 family. Nonetheless, the aircraft includes an internal weapons bay, and space set aside for an advanced radar.|$|R

2500|$|The V3 third {{prototype}} airframe, {{with the}} code PC+UC, became a true jet when it flew on 18 July 1942 in Leipheim near Günzburg, Germany, piloted by [...] test pilot Fritz Wendel. This was almost nine months {{ahead of the}} British Gloster Meteor's first flight on 5 March 1943. Its retracting conventional <b>tail</b> wheel <b>gear</b> (similar to other contemporary piston powered propeller aircraft), a feature shared with the first four Me 262 V-series airframes, caused its jet exhaust to deflect off the runway, with the wing's turbulence negating {{the effects of the}} elevators, and the first takeoff attempt was cut short.|$|R

50|$|Total {{production}} of the DH.83/DHC.83C Fox Moth was 153, being 98 in England, two in Australia and 53 in Canada after WWII. A number of different engines were used, including the 130 hp (97 kW) Gipsy IIIA on most British-built aircraft and the 145 hp (108 kW) Gipsy Major 1C on the 53 postwar DH.83C Canadian-built aircraft. The DHC-83Cs were fitted with larger pilot cockpit openings, a larger windscreen and canopy, a large ambulance cabin door {{on the port side}} to accommodate a stretcher, and did not have folding wings. The DH.83C used DH.82 Tiger Moth main and <b>tail</b> landing <b>gear.</b> The DH.83C was an excellent and economical bush plane.|$|R

25|$|The Beaver {{family of}} {{aircraft}} all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 aluminum tube {{that supports the}} <b>tail,</b> landing <b>gear</b> and seats. The wings and engine mount are similarly of 6061-T6 aluminum tube and attached to the main tube by connecting struts. The wing features aluminum tube spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits {{in as little as}} 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory-claimed build times 150–200 hours for the SS and 180–200 hours to the RX 550 Plus.|$|R
