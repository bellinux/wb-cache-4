During the eight minutes of hover needed for Merrick to transfer from his parachute harness to the jungle penetrator and be brought up, Jolly Green 02 was hit numerous times from directly ahead and Merrick was twice wounded. Youngblood rotated its tail towards the gunfire to keep the pilots from being hit.

5000|$|Silicone rubber (SiR): {{noted for}} their ability to be used over a wide {{temperature}} range and for excellent resistance to ozone, weathering and aging. Compared with most other sealing elastomers, the physical properties of silicones are poor. Generally, silicone materials are physiologically harmless so they are commonly used {{by the food and drug}} industries. Standard silicones are resistant to water (to 100 °C), aliphatic engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>oils</b> and animal and plant oils and fats. Silicones are generally not resistant to fuels, aromatic mineral oils, steam (short term to 120 °C is possible), silicone oils and greases, acids or alkalis. Fluorosilicone elastomers are far more resistant to oils and fuels. The temperature range of applications is somewhat more restricted.|$|R
40|$|The <b>transmission</b> of <b>oil</b> price shocks {{has been}} a {{question}} of central interest in macroeconomics since the 1970 s. There has been renewed interest in this question after the large and persistent fall in the real price of oil in 2014 - 16. In {{the context of this}} debate, Ramey (2017) makes the striking claim that the existing literature on the <b>transmission</b> of <b>oil</b> price shocks is fundamentally confused about {{the question of how to}} quantify the effect of oil price shocks. In particular, she asserts that the discretionary income effect on private consumption, which plays a central role in contemporary accounts of the <b>transmission</b> of <b>oil</b> price shocks to the U. S. economy, makes no economic sense and has no economic foundation. Ramey suggests that the literature has too often confused the terms-of-trade effect with this discretionary income effect, and she makes the case that the effects of the oil price decline of 2014 - 16 on private consumption are smaller for a multitude of reasons than suggested by empirical models of the discretionary income effect. We review the main arguments in Ramey (2017) and show that none of her claims hold up to scrutiny...|$|R

30|$|In contrast, {{research}} analysing price <b>transmission</b> between <b>oil</b> {{and agricultural}} commodities has received much attention in recent times. This growing interest is mainly {{triggered by the}} recent expansion in biofuel production. However, findings in the literature are not conclusive. For example, the study of Zhang et al. (2009) found {{that there is no}} long-run relationship between fuel prices and agricultural commodity prices. Gardebroek & Hernandez (2013) used multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models and found that there is volatility transmission from corn to ethanol for the US market, but not the converse. They did not find spillover 3 from oil to corn and concluded that {{there is no evidence that}} volatility in energy markets stimulated corn markets. Spillover effects from corn to ethanol markets were found in the study of Trujillo-Barrera et al. (2012) using futures prices. In contrast to the study of Gardebroek and Hernandez (2013), they also found spillover effects from oil to corn and ethanol markets. These results support the study of Wu et al. (2010), who also found spillover between oil and corn using futures prices. Using a stochastic volatility model, Du et al. (2011) reported volatility spillover from oil, corn and wheat markets using futures prices post 2006. Serra (2011) used a semiparametric GARCH model to analyse spillover effects between oil, ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil. Results of this study indicated strong volatility links between these prices. In a more recent study, Nazlioglu et al. (2013) found volatility <b>transmission</b> between <b>oil</b> and selected agricultural commodities post the commodity crisis of 2008, using a causality in variance test developed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006). <b>Transmission</b> effects between <b>oil,</b> ethanol and corn prices in China were analysed by Wu and Shiping (2013).
