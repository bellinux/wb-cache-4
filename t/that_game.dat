50|$|The {{characterization}} of games as {{works of art}} has been controversial. While recognizing <b>that</b> <b>games</b> may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position <b>that</b> <b>games</b> are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.|$|R
50|$|Newell {{stated that}} some of his {{favorite}} games were Super Mario 64, Doom, and a Burroughs mainframe version of Star Trek. Doom convinced him <b>that</b> <b>games</b> were the future of entertainment, and Super Mario 64 convinced him <b>that</b> <b>games</b> were a form of art.

50|$|Robert Workman, of Modojo, said <b>that</b> the <b>game</b> {{reminds him}} of 1950s sci-fi, has a good soundtrack, and that he enjoys seeing the aliens explode.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{argues that}} it is {{important}} to study noninstrumental uses of ICT, including computer games. Specifically, the article presents the results of qualitative and quantitative work spanning eight years of investigation in Central Asia focused on computer gaming in public Internet cafes as well as private spaces. The results presented demonstrate that people do indeed play games in resource constrained environments. The paper demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>games</b> constitute a significant portion of the ICT ecology in developing regions and provide a pathway to people’s “first touch ” of a computer, that gamers have more frequent interaction with technology than basic Internet users, <b>that</b> <b>games</b> bring more diverse users to computers by providing a pathway to ICT use for people with lower levels of education, and <b>that</b> <b>games</b> can motivate innovation in the technology space. Additionally, our findings indicate that both genders engage in game playing. The article makes the case <b>that</b> <b>games</b> can be a source of informal learning about ICT, and as such, games and gaming culture in the developing world merit further study...|$|R

30|$|Game {{theory is}} a {{mathematical}} approach for studying multiparty decision problems in interactive environments (Myerson 1991).

Nisan et al. (2007) show <b>that</b> <b>games</b> with exactly one Nash equilibrium are in a lower complexity class than are NP-complete problems, whereas games with two or more Nash equilibriums are NP-complete.|$|R
