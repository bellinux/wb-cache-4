5|$|Poverty {{may have}} pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh {{may have felt}} family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> baby Willem to her brother.

25|$|Elisabeth was {{strongly}} {{attached to her}} parents, especially <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> was still a child {{in search of an}} identity of her own when an adult role with unusual obligations and restrictions was imposed upon her. She had no control in her new life and was unable to identify herself as both the spouse of the emperor and a young mother. As a result, she attempted to recreate her childhood with its lack of obligations. The only quality for which she felt herself appreciated, and over which she had control, was her physical appearance, so she started cultivating this as the primary source of her self-esteem. Obsessively achievement-oriented and almost compulsively perfectionistic in her attitudes, she became a slave to her own beauty and image.|$|E
