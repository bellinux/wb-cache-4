The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad, under Major General Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations.

5|$|From the 19th century, deputies {{were hired}} in larger areas {{to assist the}} sheriffs. Following the democratization in 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary {{responsibility}} for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use <b>those</b> <b>forces</b> outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E

Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were regular soldiers and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. <b>Those</b> <b>forces</b> were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M-42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of different sizes.|$|E

5|$|Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch {{organized}} {{an ambitious}} assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical {{support from the}} queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached {{the southern end of}} Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (<b>Those</b> <b>forces</b> were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.|$|E
