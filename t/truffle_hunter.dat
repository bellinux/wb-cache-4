40|$|Although ranging {{among the}} most {{expensive}} gourmet foods, it remains unclear whether Burgundy truffles (Tuber aestivum) accumulate radioactivity at a harmful level comparable to other fungal species. Here, we measure the 137 Cs in 82 T. aestivum fruit bodies from Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, and Hungary. All tested specimens reveal insignificant radiocaesium concentrations, thus providing an all-clear for many <b>truffle</b> <b>hunters</b> and cultivators in large parts of Europe {{as well as the}} subsequent chain of dealers and customers from around the world. Our results are particularly relevant in the light of ongoing efforts to cultivate Burgundy truffles, as well as the fact that several forest ecosystems are still highly contaminated with 137 Cs, for which mushrooms are one of the main pathways to human diets...|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: In {{black truffle}} plantations, many factors are driving the {{emergence}} of new pests and diseases which in forestry areas go unnoticed. Usually, the incidence of most of them is low. Nevertheless, in specific cases, some of them are capable of causing irreversible damage that could endanger the harvest or even tree survival. Area of study: This paper presents an in-depth study of the pests and diseases more frequently associated with truffle plantations in the region of Aragón (Spain). Damages have been arranged into the main production stages: nursery, plantations and fruiting bodies. Material and methods: The data used in this work come from the technical enquiries from truffle growers to researchers and technical staff, as well as from field visits undertaken by those work teams. Sampling methodology has been carried out following standard procedures. Insects were collected with the traps commonly used in entomology works. Main result: More than 50 damages have been described in this paper. Some of them are capable of weakening the plants and other can even kill them. Mycorrhizal competitor fungi have also been considered in this paper. These organisms do not cause real phytosanitary problems, but they can lead to important economic losses. Research highlights: Researches, <b>truffle</b> <b>hunters</b> and managers must be alert {{in the face of the}} possible occurrence of potentially dangerous organisms. The final aim: being able to take action in an efficient way in the case of a pest outbrea...|$|R
