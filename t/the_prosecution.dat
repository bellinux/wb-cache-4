Wood also faced a specimen charge of stealing £84,000 from clients he represented in property deals, although <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> claimed the sum could have been £150,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{argued that}} {{pressure}} to fill fund raising quotas {{had led to}} 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{was the culmination of}} a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{presented the}} charges to Pre-Trial Chamber II as two separate cases, one case was <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of Ali, Kenyatta, and Mathaura, {{and the second}} case is <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of Kosgey, Ruto, and Sang. All six suspects were accused of crimes against humanity.|$|E

5|$|Before jury {{selection}} was complete, {{it was discovered}} that Shakur was pregnant. Due to the possibility of miscarriage, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> successfully requested a mistrial for Shakur; Acoli's trial continued.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutor John McGohey did not {{assert that}} the {{defendants}} had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin. Belknap (1994), p 209. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.|$|E

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> rested, {{the defence}} opened its {{case with a}} motion to dismiss based on the trial itself being illegal. Servatius {{challenged}} Eichmann's kidnapping and {{the basis for the}} Israeli law under which he had been indicted. He argued that if the trial were to continue, it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel's actions, and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate. The defence motion was subsequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E

5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E

5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury. But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E

5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> case collapsed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Although {{roots of}} {{criminal}} prosecutions are traced {{back in the}} 17 th and 18 th century but newly emerged discipline of international law namely international criminal law gained its scope after adoption Rome Statute. However, statute {{has not yet been}} universally accepted and various discrepancies have been raised by various states regarding the Jurisdiction and applicable procedure of International Criminal Court (ICC). Prior to the establishment of ICC, initially various international tribunals were established for <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> of perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression, particularly after World War II. However, <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were subjected to serious criticism not only by the states representing the accused persons rather by the prosecuting states as well, on the grounds that all <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were partial in natur...|$|R

5|$|On 2 October 1997, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{began to}} call more witnesses. Although {{attendance}} did not abate, most observers were police officers or paid spectators. One witness, {{who claimed to have}} participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b>|$|E
