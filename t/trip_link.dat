40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} combined {{qualitative and quantitative}} activity based analysis methodologies framework for integrated fixed activity chaining schedules (IFACS). What is central to my dissertation {{is the extent to}} which the type, sequence, duration, and timing of fixed activities influence trip chaining. The goal is to improve the practice of travel behavior forecasting by modeling the activity patterns and chaining behavior of individuals with restricted schedules. Cluster analysis methods are applied to narrow down the endless possibilities of individual trip decision-making into a manageable group. Then space-time prism concepts are applied to locate unique activity travel patterns. Qualitative examples show that aggregate and individual trip-chaining behaviors are not easy to model. Informed by the qualitative analysis results, the framework incorporates both discrete choice and time-to-event models as quantitative analysis tools. The quantitative models cover two levels of chaining: <b>trip</b> <b>link</b> and whole journey. Logit models are used to analyze the choice to make a chained link right after the completion of an activity, and the decision to conduct a chained journey. Poisson models are used to examine the decision to make a number of chained links on a journey. Hazard-based duration models are used to analyze time of chaining events by studying the duration of a chained journey, then the duration of time elapsed till a chained link is made right after a fixed activity with the goal of defining a time threshold to the occurrence of trip chaining. Integrating results from qualitative and quantitative methods leads to a better understanding of how people make their trip-chaining and travel behavior decisions. Data from the 1998 Mobidrive six-week travel diary survey is used in the analyses. This framework focuses on the effects of five types of fixed activities on trip-chaining behavior: work, work-related, school, further education, and club/group meetings. Understanding factors influencing a person 2 ̆ 7 s decision to participate in a trip chain allows motivations behind trip-chaining behavior to become more tangible. One of the highlights of the analysis results of the modeling framework is discovering that the chaining behavior of individuals is influenced in different ways among different population subgroups. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation is being performed to evaluate exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDVs) circulating {{in urban areas}} and involved in commercial ship- ping activities. The study {{is focused on the}} city of Genoa, whose urban road network is influenced by highway connec- tions and shipping activities, as seven motorway exits and more than twenty accesses to port area are located within the urban area.

The typical urban <b>trips</b> <b>linking</b> highway exits to port gates and the HDV mission profiles within the port area were then defined, whose validation was performed through an experimental campaign for HDV instantaneous speed measurements on urban trips and in port zones. The availability of speed patterns enabled the application of Passenger Car and Heavy Duty Emission Model (PHEM) for the estimation of fuel consumption and emission factors for selected HDV classes.

The HDV fleet composition and traffic driving from highways to the maritime port of Genoa and crossing {{the city were}} analysed. Typical urban <b>trips</b> <b>linking</b> highway exits to port gates and HDV mission profiles within the port area were defined. A validation was performed through on-board instru- mentation to record HDV instantaneous speeds in urban and port zones.

Representative speed profiles were then used to simulate fuel consumption and emissions for HDVs, using the Passenger car and Heavy duty Emission Model (PHEM). Complementary estimations were derived from Copert and HBEFA methodologies, allowing the comparison of different calculation approaches and scales. Finally, PHEM was implemented to assess the performances of EGR or SCR systems for NOX reduction in urban driving and at very low speeds.

40|$|Gender {{is both an}} archetypal and {{adaptive}} dimension of the urban condition and thus remains a key moving target for planning practitioners and scholars alike. This {{is especially true of}} women’s growing, if not revolutionary, involvement in the economy. A familiar exception is the <b>trip</b> <b>linking</b> work and home – the commute – which has been consistently and persistently shorter for women than men. That said, new reports suggest that the gender gap in commuting time and distance may have quietly vanished in some areas. To explore this possibility, I use panel data from the American Housing Survey to better measure and explain commute trends for the entire U. S. from 1985 through 2005. They overwhelmingly indicate that differences stubbornly endure, with men’s and women’s commuting distances converging only slowly and commuting times diverging. My results also show that commuting times are converging for all races, especially for women; women’s job access remains poorer than men’s, and women’s trips to work by transit are dwindling rapidly. Thus sex continues {{to play an important role}} explaining travel, housing, and labor market dynamics, with major implications for planning practice.

An application to our large-scale and anonymized bank card transaction dataset enables us to output <b>linked</b> <b>trips</b> for shopping all over the city: the method enables us to predict the other shops {{most likely to be}} visited by a customer given a particular shop that was already visited as an input. In addition, our methodology can consider all transaction activities conducted by customers for a whole city in addition to the location of stores dispersed in the city. This approach enables us to uncover not only simple <b>linked</b> <b>trips</b> such as transition movements between stores but also the edge weight for each <b>linked</b> <b>trip</b> in the specific district. Thus, the proposed methodology can complement conventional research methods.

40|$|Convenience {{markets with}} {{gasoline}} pumps have flourished throughout the United States {{in the past}} 10 years. The growing demand for self-service gasoline and convenience grocery goods, readily accessible with fast service, have fueled a boom in the convenience market business. As transportation engineers and planners, we are asked to determine the impacts of developments on the transportation system. Because the convenience market {{is a relatively new}} concept and limited data exist in the literature on the trip characteristics of these stores, we decided to study the trip characteristics of convenience markets with gas pumps in the Billings, Montana, area. The objectives of the study were to 1. Define the trip generation characteristics of convenience markets with gas pumps. 2. Analyze the trip characteristics of patrons to these markets. 3. Determine the trip assignment characteristics for these markets by distinguishing primary <b>trips,</b> diverted <b>linked</b> <b>trips,</b> and nondiverted <b>linked</b> <b>trips.</b> Definitions Certain terms used in this report are defined as follows: ● Convenience market with gas pumps: A store that sells convenience food items, gasoline products, and other car products and that is usually open 15 to 16 hours per day. It has self-service gas pumps and between 1400 and 2400 square feet of gross floor area; one person manages the store. ● Tip: A single or one-direction vehicle movement with either the origin or destination inside the study site. ● 7 ?ip ends: The total of all trips entering p/us all trips leaving the site over a given period of time. ● Primary trips: Trips from home, work, or school to the convenience market that return directly to point of origin. The trip’s only purpose was shopping at the convenience market. ● Diverted/inked trips: Trips in which the stop at the convenience market is part of a sequence of two or more stops within the total trip and where the stop at the convenience market required a route diversion from the route that would otherwise be followed if the stop at the convenience market were not made. ● Nondiverted <b>linked</b> trips: <b>Trips</b> in which the stop at the convenience market is part of a sequence of two or more stops within the total trip and where the driver was already traveling on the street on which the convenience market is located...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} issues involved in modeling complex travel patterns. Existing models have the shortcoming of not representing the interdependencies among <b>trip</b> <b>links</b> in <b>trip</b> chains with multiple non-home stops. A theoretical model based on utility theory and explicitly accounting for the trade-offs involved {{in the choice of}} multiple-stop chains is developed. Using this theoretical model, utility maximizing conditions for a household's choice of a daily travel pattern are derived. The optimum travel pattern is described {{in terms of the number}} of chairs (tours) traveled on a given day and in terms of the number of stops (sojourns) made on each of those chains. For a given household, the form of the optimum pattern is a function of the transportation expenditures (time, cost) required to reach potential destinations. Constraints on the conditions of optimality due to the limited and discrete nature of travel pattern alternatives are also considered. Parameters of the general utility function were estimated empirically using actual travel data derived from a home interview survey taken in Washington, D. C. The multinomial logit model is used to relate utility scores for the alternative travel patterns to choice probabilities. The resulting parameter estimates agree with theoretical expectations and with empirical results obtained in other studies. In order to demonstrate the empirical and theoretical implications of the model, forecasts for various transportation policies (e. g., gasoline price increases, transit fare reductions), as made by this model and by other less complex models, are compared. The results of these comparisons indicate the need for expanding the scope of existing travel forecasting models to explicit considerations of trip chaining behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) were used to track individuals {{and the results were}} compared with traditional pen and paper based travel surveys. The objective was to assess the capability of GPS to replace or, alternatively, to complement the traditional travel survey or diary. Small, nonintrusive GPS units were distributed to 130 respondents in the Western Cape. The respondents were also asked to complete a travel survey for the period of tracking. The results of the two techniques-were compared on issues such as origin and destination of the trips, routes taken, total number of trips and tours, and type of information delivered. GPS tracking delivered accurate information on the origin and destination of trips, routes taken, number of trips and tours and with additional examination, on the transport mode used. Comparing GPS and traditional surveys showed that GPS captured significantly more trips and tours originating from home and work. These 'missed' trips in the diary are often shorter walks or 'strolling' trips. It was also found that respondents tend to round off their trip departure and arrival times and under-estimate trip duration. Generally, it was felt that the diary accurately recorded the work activity and the normal routine but did not capture short <b>trips</b> <b>linked</b> to the work trip. While GPS devices do deliver adequate information, the cost of the technology, the programming involved to extract information from the large datasets, and the auxiliary requirements, do not make GPS travel surveys an alternative to traditional techniques in the short term. The current role of GPS is more as validation or providing expansion factors for larger surveys on, for example, trip generation and route choice.
