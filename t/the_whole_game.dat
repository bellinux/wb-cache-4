5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> due to positive feedback.

After playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> in Stevenage's 1–0 defeat at Cheltenham Town in September 2010, Byrom suffered a number of injuries that {{kept him out of}} the first-team for five months. He returned to first-team action in February 2011, coming on as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–0 loss at Bury. Four days later, he started in a 1–0 defeat at Shrewsbury Town. He was an unused substitute for Stevenage's next five league matches, before starting in the club's 3–3 home draw with Bury {{on the final day of}} the 2010–11 season – playing a key role in two of Stevenage's goals to ensure the club reached the play-offs. Byrom scored his first goal of the season in Stevenage's 2–0 home win against Accrington Stanley in the play-off semi-final first leg, reaching the ball before Accrington goalkeeper Alex Cisak to double Stevenage's lead. He played <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> in the second leg, a 1–0 victory that ensured Stevenage made the play-off final. Byrom started in the final, a 1–0 victory against Torquay United at Old Trafford, a win that meant Stevenage earned back-to-back promotions to League One. Despite ending the season on a positive note, Byrom made just 12 appearances, scoring once, due to a host of injuries interrupting his campaign.|$|E

Slew scored three goals during the cup run, including a goal in the first leg of the final.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E

Within this frame even China’s successes (both sporting and organizational) are read as either counterfeit or as unfair.

5|$|Foster joined newly {{promoted}} League Two side Stevenage on {{a two-year}} contract on 31 May 2010. Foster made his Stevenage {{debut in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 draw against Macclesfield Town, playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> in the centre of defence. After the Macclesfield game, Foster did {{not appear in the}} first-team until late September 2010, coming on as a late substitute in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Lincoln City. He then appeared as a 52nd-minute substitute in the club's victory over Burton Albion, but was sent-off for a foul on Shaun Harrad. Foster scored his first goal for Stevenage in January 2011, scoring the first goal of the game in Stevenage's 4–2 home win over Barnet. Foster received his second red card of the 2010–11 season in a game against Northampton Town, receiving the red card for a foul on Nana Ofori-Twumasi, a game that Stevenage went on to lose 2–0. Stevenage appealed against the sending off, but the appeal was subsequently rejected. This ultimately meant that Foster had played his last game of the 2010–11 season, serving a four-match suspension that ruled him out of Stevenage's end of season 3–3 draw with Bury, as well as the club's subsequent play-off campaign. Foster played 23 times for Stevenage in his only season with the club, scoring once, and the team went on to win promotion into League One via the play-offs.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Holroyd was {{assigned}} the number nine shirt following {{the departure of}} fellow striker Scott Rendell. He started the club's first match of the season, playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> in a 2–0 home defeat to Barrow. Three days later, he scored twice in Cambridge's 3–1 win against Ebbsfleet United, scoring both goals. Holroyd scored his first professional hat-trick four days later, scoring against his former employers, Chester City, as Cambridge came from two goals down to win the match 4–2. One of his goals included an audacious over head kick, 15 yards from goal. Holroyd scored four goals in two games shortly after, netting against Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. He scored a further two goals in Cambridge's 4–3 home loss to Luton Town in September 2009, taking his goal tally to eleven for the season. His twelfth goal of the season came against Cambridge's local rivals, Histon, Holroyd netting with just nine minutes remaining in a 1–1 draw. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot in Cambridge's 4–0 win against Ebbsfleet United. His fine goalscoring form continued into November 2009, scoring in victories against Kidderminster Harriers and Ilkeston Town respectively. After his goal against Ilkeston Town, Holroyd did not find the net {{until the end of}} December 2009, scoring just before half-time for Cambridge as they lost 2–1 at Mansfield Town. A week later, Cambridge United assistant manager, Paul Carden, said that he expected Holroyd to leave the club in the January transfer window. He subsequently played his last game for the club in Cambridge's 1–0 home defeat to Eastbourne Borough. During {{the first half of the}} 2009–10 season, Holroyd scored 15 goals in 25 games for Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Laird {{scored in}} Stevenage's {{pre-season}} friendly victory over Histon. He {{started in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. In September 2010, in games against Cheltenham Town and Torquay United respectively, Laird {{was used as a}} left midfielder, as opposed to playing in his usual left-back position. He reverted to the left-back spot in Stevenage's 1–0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty spot, in a 2–1 win over Burton Albion in October 2010. A week later, he missed the chance to double his goal tally for the season, missing a second-half penalty in a 0–0 draw against Morecambe. Coincidentally, Laird's second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Morecambe in January 2011; he scored from close range following John Mousinho's cross to give Stevenage the lead. Just three days later, Laird scored his third goal of the season, netting with a curling effort from 25 yards out to give Stevenage their third goal of a 3–0 win against Rotherham United. Laird was initially credited with scoring an 87th-minute winner in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Crewe Alexandra on 19 February 2011, but the goal was eventually given to teammate Byron Harrison. At the age of 22, Laird captained Stevenage {{for the first time in}} their 1–0 loss to Hereford United on 8 March 2011. In the club's following match, against Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Laird was sent-off for two bookable offences, although Stevenage held on to win the match 1–0. Laird's fourth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's 3–3 draw against Bury on 7 May 2011, as he opened the scoring with a strike from 25 yards out. He played a total of 54 games during the 2010–11 season, scoring four goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Laird playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

He captained the {{side in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> in a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. Roberts scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–0 away win at local rivals Barnet in November 2010. His second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Barnet in January 2011, this time scoring the fourth in a 4–2 win at Broadhall Way, as well as netting in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town on 26 February. A week later, Roberts was given a straight red card for bringing down Torquay United striker Chris Zebroski when he had rounded the goalkeeper, a match that Torquay {{would go on to}} win 2–0. He scored twice against Macclesfield Town on 26 March 2011, taking his goal tally for the 2010–11 campaign to five goals. Roberts scored his sixth goal of the season, his highest seasonal goal tally during his three years at Stevenage, in the club's 2–2 draw at Stockport County on 9 April 2011. The goal, a half-volley at the back post, gave Stevenage a brief lead in the match just after half-time. Stevenage faced one of Roberts' former employers, Accrington Stanley, in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals {{as a result of the}} club's sixth-place finish. Roberts played in both games, which Stevenage won by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. He led the side out at Old Trafford for the final against Torquay United on 28 May 2011, playing the whole match as Stevenage went on to win 1–0. This meant that Roberts had captained the side to back-to-back promotions, earning a place in League One for the first time in their history. Stevenage also had the best defensive record in League Two during the 2010–11 campaign, conceding 45 goals. The campaign was also notable for Stevenage's FA Cup run into the Fourth Round, with Roberts playing in all five matches, including the club's 3–1 home victory over Premier League opposition in the form of Newcastle United. Roberts made 52 appearances in all competitions throughout the season, scoring six times.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was part}} of the {{starting}} eleven in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture {{at the start of the}} 2011–12 season, playing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>game</b> as the club drew 0–0 at home to Exeter City. In Stevenage's next game, Wilson provided the assist for Stacy Long's goal in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup. He also assisted Craig Reid in the club's 3–1 away win at Bournemouth on 16 August 2011. Three days later, on 19 August, Wilson signed a contract extension at the club. He added to his two previous assists by assisting Craig Reid's first goal in the club's 4–2 home win against Rochdale on 3 September. Wilson scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, scoring Stevenage's fourth goal of the match just before half-time. In the same game, Wilson provided the run and pass to assist Darius Charles' second-half goal, Stevenage's fifth of the game. He added a second goal to his goal tally in Stevenage's League Trophy penalty loss against League Two side AFC Wimbledon — opening the scoring after seven minutes when Brett Johnson's clearance cannoned off of Wilson's leg and beat the stranded Seb Brown in the AFC Wimbledon goal. His fine form for the season continued, and he was pivotal in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Sheffield United, assisting Mark Roberts' goal, before winning a penalty late-on, which was duly converted by Scott Laird. He also set-up Chris Beardsley's 38th-minute strike, to open the scoring, in an eventual 2–1 win against Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. In the club's last game of 2011, on 31 December, Wilson scored the only goal of the game as Stevenage defeated Wycombe Wanderers 1–0 at Adams Park. The goal came in the 82nd minute of the match, with Wilson powerfully beating Nikki Bull from close-range following Luke Freeman's precise cross. He was also on hand to score two of Stevenage's five goals in a 5–1 victory against Rochdale at Spotland on 14 January 2012. Both of Wilson's goals came in the second-half; the first came shortly after the interval, when he ran onto Chris Beardsley's rolled pass to fire the ball into the net, with his second coming after he ran onto Mark Roberts' clearance to calmly beat Péter Kurucz in the Rochdale goal. Wilson scored one further goal during the campaign, scoring a diving header in injury-time in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic at Broadhall Way. It took Wilson's goal tally to six for the season, with the player being ever-present during the campaign under both Westley and new manager Gary Smith, playing in all 56 of the club's games, as Stevenage narrowly lost in the play-off semi-finals.|$|E
