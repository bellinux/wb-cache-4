40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to probe into the dialectical {{relationship between the}} subjectivity of <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> and socio-cultural norms. The socio-cultural norms inevitably regulate <b>the</b> <b>translator’s</b> translating activity, as acceptability of the translated text is the primary concern of most translators. However, {{this does not mean}} that the subjectivity of <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> is suppressed. <b>The</b> <b>translator,</b> in <b>the</b> wider socio-cultural context, assumes the subjective role in the translation process. The descriptive nature of these norms provides the great possibility for <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> to exert his subjectivity, which can be realized by <b>the</b> <b>translator’s</b> active manipulations on the source text. This point is well illustrated in the practical translation as <b>the</b> <b>translator’s</b> behaviour is constrained by a list of socio-cultural norms such as politics, ideology, ethics, morality and religion. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{entitled}} <b>The</b> <b>Translator’s</b> Voice in <b>The</b> Translated Version of Michael Scott’s The Sorceress: The Secret of The Immortal Nicholas Flamel is a {{content analysis of}} Michael Scott’s translated novel by Mohammad Baihaqi focusing on <b>the</b> <b>translator’s</b> voice. <b>The</b> discussion focuses on the strategies which are used by <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> to contribute his voice. Therefore, the discussion is framed within the theories of translation strategies (Venuti, 2010) and <b>the</b> <b>translator’s</b> voice in translated narrative (Hermans, 2010). The study utilizes a qualitative method particularly content analysis. The result {{of the present study}} shows that three most frequent strategies used by <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> are preservation, omission and addition. The study also discovers that <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> contributes his voice mostly through two cases; case of self-reflexiveness and self-referentiality and case of contextual overdetermination. The study shows that <b>the</b> <b>translator</b> has his voice visible through the use of strategies in foreignization and in the cases above since it may be seen necessary to accommodate the novel’s culture in the target language. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAdherence of monocytes to endothelial {{cells and}} {{subsequently}} to basement membrane represents the initial steps in monocyte migration from the vasculature to the interstitium. We investigated {{the role of}} adhesion to endothelial cells and basement membrane in the induction of the cytokine IL- 1 β. We demonstrated that mRNA for IL- 1 β is induced in adherent THP- 1 cells, {{but not in a}} matrix-specific manner. Adherence to fibrinogen, however, causes an increase in mRNA for IL- 1 β. A background level of IL- 1 β mRNA induction was observed in cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> all matrices, including the non-specific human serum albumin substrate, as compared to non-adherent cells cultured in teflon troughs. In addition, antibodies to CD 11 a, CD 11 b, β 1 integrin, VLA 4, αvβ 3 (VNR), and ICAM- 1 did not induce significant IL- 1 β mRNA when THP- 1 cells were <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> those immunoglobulins. THP- 1 cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> immune complexes of anti-CD 11 a, anti-CD 11 b, anti-VLA 4, anti-VNR, and anti-ICAM- 1 showed greater mRNA induction than cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> primary antibodies alone. THP- 1 cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> non-specific immune complexes gave the highest level of mRNA induction. Secretion of IL- 1 β protein, measured by ELISA at 24 h, was greatest when cells were <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> immobilized immune complexes or to fibrinogen. Our results demonstrate that a general adherence-induced increase in IL- 1 β gene expression is greatly enhanced by the presence of immune complex...|$|R

40|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} against plasminogen activator inhibitor type-I (PAI- 1) caused rapid retraction and rounding of substrate-attached HT- 1080 cells. The kinetics {{and extent}} of antibody-mediated cell rounding were not dependent on either urokinase or plasmin activity. Cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> vitronectin-coated substrates detached within 2 h of antibody addition. Cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin were unaffected by the antibodies. Immunoblotting of substrate-attached material indicated that HT- 1080 cells deposited PAI- 1 into vitronectin, but not fibronectin, dependent contacts. These {{data suggest that the}} antibody- mediated cell rounding resulted from a steric disruption of vitronectin- dependent adhesions, indicating that the binding site on vitronectin for PAI- 1 is near, but does not overlap, the binding site for vitronectin receptor. The accumulation of PAI- 1 into vitronectin- dependent adhesion sites correlated temporally with the preferential degradation of fibronectin from the substrate. HT- 1080 cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> either fibronectin or vitronectin were able to activate exogenous plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin levels were increased 200 % on cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> fibronectin and 100 % on cells <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> vitronectin. In the presence of a neutralizing antibody against PAI- 1, vitronectin adherent cells activated plasminogen to the same extent as fibronectin adherent cells. Plasmin levels of 200 % above baseline were associated with retraction of cells from the substrate. The ability of vitronectin <b>adherent</b> cells <b>to</b> activate exogenous plasmin was completely blocked in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against urokinase. These data represent the first demonstration that vitronectin-associated PAI- 1 regulates urokinase in focal contact areas...|$|R
