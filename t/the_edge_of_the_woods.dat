25|$|Anderson {{incorporates}} precursor {{texts that}} parallel Melinda's experience. In the story, Melinda's English class studies Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, which features similar fairy tale imagery. Hester Prynne, an outcast protagonist like Melinda, {{lives in a}} cottage at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Hester's cottage parallels Melinda's closet. For both women, the seclusion of the forest represents a space beyond social demands. The deciphering of Hawthorne's symbolism mimics the process faced by readers of Melinda's narrative. Similarly, Anderson connects Melinda's trauma to that of Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Melinda places a poster of Angelou in her closet. She admires Angelou because her novel was banned by the school board. Melinda and Angelou were both outcasts. Like Melinda, Angelou was silenced following her childhood rape.|$|E

25|$|Warren found Crawford's {{division}} hesitating at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> on {{the east}} side of Gilliam's field at the same time Custer's division was being held back by Rooney Lee's men to the south and west. The Union soldiers were not heeding officers' orders to move forward against Corse's line of breastworks. After a few minutes for reorganization of the units, Warren took the corps flag and rode into the field with his staff officers and called for the men to follow. The men then rose and followed their officers and color bearers to attack Corse's brigade, capturing many prisoners and dispersing the other Confederates. In the attack, Warren's horse was shot from under him just short of the Confederate line, an orderly was killed and Lieutenant Colonel Hollon Richardson of the 7th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment was badly wounded when he jumped his horse between Warren and the Confederate defenders.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Cyr put his cavalry and {{artillery}} {{in the middle}} of his leading unit and was able to avoid pursuit. His column arrived at Trippstadt as the town was being attacked by Kleist. This lucky accident allowed Saint-Cyr's column to easily brush off Kleist's division and escape. Ambert's column had more trouble. His infantry was supposed to hold the edge of a forest until the cavalry {{and artillery}} of the rear guard reached it. By some error, the foot soldiers continued on their march. The Prussian horsemen routed their adversaries and the defeated French cavalry stampeded through the ranks of their own infantry, causing chaos. Oudinot's battalion, made of sterner stuff, chased off the Prussian cavalry and returned to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> where they recovered some of the abandoned artillery. However, they were unable to drag away the guns because the horse teams had been killed. Continuing the withdrawal, Oudinot's men encountered a Prussian roadblock, but forced their way through. The two retreating columns reassembled at Pirmasens except for some soldiers who fled as far as Bitche. At Kaiserslautern the French lost about 1,000 men killed, wounded or missing in addition to 17 artillery pieces and two colors. Total Prussian casualties were 110 while Saxon losses were unknown but very light.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{placed the}} 90 men {{of his company}} in {{position}} facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank {{at the edge of}} a woods. Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position. This group was a security force for the mortars and they dropped to the ground about one-third of the way down the ridge.|$|E

After {{a couple of}} miserable days, they decided to carry the shore positions and try to overcome the French earthworks. They set out on 20 October [...] "in the best European tradition, with drums beating and colors unfurled," [...] {{but there was a}} skirmish at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The New Englanders could not cope with the maintained heavy Canadian fire, and the brass field guns fired into the woods had no effect. Although Sainte-Hélène was mortally wounded, 150 of the attackers had been killed in action, and were utterly discouraged. They made a retreat in a state of near panic on 22 October, even abandoning five field guns on the shore.|$|E
500|$|While Dilkes {{was moving}} on Ruffin's {{position}} on Barrosa Ridge, Barnard {{and the light}} companies advanced through the woods towards Leval's division. Unaware of the impending British assault, the French had taken no precautions and were advancing in two columns of march, with no forward line of voltigeurs. [...] The unexpected appearance of British skirmishers caused such confusion that some French regiments, thinking there were cavalry present, formed square. [...] These were prime targets for shrapnel rounds fired by the ten cannon under Major Duncan which, having made rapid progress through the woods, arrived in time to support the skirmish line. As the situation became clearer, the French organised themselves into their customary attacking formation—the 'column of divisions'—all the time under fire from Barnard's light companies and Duncan's artillery. [...] Finally, with the French now in their fighting columns and beginning their advance, Barnard was forced to draw back. [...] Leval's men then encountered Bushe's companies of the 20th Portuguese, who supported the light battalion's retreat and kept the French engaged until Wheatley's brigade had formed up in line on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The retreating light companies joined Wheatley's troops; Leval's division of 3,800 men was now marching on an Anglo-Portuguese line of 1,400 men supported by cannon.|$|E

[...] A column of men under Colonel Anthony Wayne fared only a little better, {{arriving}} out of the swamp only to face Fraser's formation. A brief exchange of fire took place: but the Americans, clearly outmatched by Fraser's forces, broke and ran, leaving arms and supplies behind. Portions of the American force retreated to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> which gave them some cover, and attempted to engage some of the British troops: but fire from those troops kept them off the road and fire from some of the ships in the river kept them from the shore. [...] St. Clair and a number of men made it back to the landing site, only to find it occupied by the British troops. Only by returning to the swampy woods and continuing to flee upriver did these men escape capture at that time. [...] Wayne eventually managed to form a rear guard of about 800 men, which attempted an attack on the British position; but they were driven back into the woods. Wayne then led a staggered retreat, in which companies of men slipped away, with the woods giving cover to hide their true numbers.|$|E

Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. [...] Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops.|$|E

[...] Barclay, finding Fournier attacking his right flank, fell back {{to the right of}} the main Russian line. [...] Bennigsen reinforced him with two infantry regiments and some cavalry, and directed an artillery battery to fire on the wood. [...] Thus reinforced Barclay attacked the wood.
