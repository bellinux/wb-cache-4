5|$|Following Beckford's {{death in}} 1844, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> lands were donated to Walcot parish and a burial ground created, with the Scarlet Drawing Room being {{converted}} into a chapel. In 1931 the house and tower were damaged by a fire and a public appeal was made for funds for its restoration. The cemetery closed in 1992 {{and the next year}} the site was bought by the Bath Preservation Trust who have carried out extensive renovation. It is now home to a museum collection displaying furniture originally made for <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> paintings, prints and objects illustrating Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts.|$|E
5|$|In August 1649 {{a wooden}} {{staircase}} {{was built to}} the outside wall of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> an open iron fire grate affixed to the top. Originally it was planned to burn coal in the lighthouse, but due to high transport costs of coal, wood was used instead.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the base}} of the tower was solid stone without any rooms; the top of the {{lighthouse}} was reached using external wooden stairs, which were later replaced with iron ones. During reconstruction in the 1800s, a stairway was cut into <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> has remained in use since.|$|E
5|$|St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is {{a medieval}} parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While {{a church and}} a priest {{are likely to have}} been present in the {{settlement}} since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> spire. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> spire can be dated to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England.|$|E

5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch.

5|$|Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and {{overseer}} of {{the parish}} restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> <b>and</b> by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the lancet window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs were made to <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> <b>and</b> it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore {{the condition of the}} moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|Beckford's Tower, {{originally}} {{known as}} Lansdown Tower, is an architectural folly built in neo-classical style on Lansdown Hill, just outside Bath, Somerset, England. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> its attached railings are {{designated as a}} Grade I listed building. Along with the adjoining Lansdown Cemetery it is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E

5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman when not in military use.|$|E

5|$|From when it opened, {{the tower}} was {{referred}} to as both the Bond Tower and the R Tower, owing to the presence of both logos on the building's exterior.

5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately £1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates expressed concern about <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> <b>and</b> the risk that it might fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients. As an alternative to demolition, it was taken into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge.
