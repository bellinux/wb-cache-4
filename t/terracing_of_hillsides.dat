40|$|The University of Windsor and BAIF Development Research Foundation {{worked with}} the tribal and rural people of Akole Taluka to design a {{strategy}} for access to a year-round water supply. Three villages, comprising 494 households, were selected as partners. Participatory management and evaluation were essential components of the project. Water-harvesting and-spreading technologies {{were put in place}} at demonstration sites over an area of 1, 000 ha. Fourteen masonry check-dams and 3 ferrocement gabions provided about 73, 000 cu m of water for the partner villages and outlying areas. Twenty-six households utilized roofwater-harvesting systems. Up to 20 percent of households took water from six developed springs. Several dug wells were deepened and existing bore wells received workovers. The increase in water availability during the pre-monsoon period was about 750 l/d per capita. Runoff was diverted into shallow aquifers, by means of expanded <b>terracing</b> <b>of</b> <b>hillsides,</b> combined with systems of contour trenches and soil bunds, as well as 19 farm ponds. Infiltration pits were excavated, most notably on unterraced hillslopes. Soil conservation in support of water-resource management involved the use of 75 gabions, 75 drystone bunds and 6, 550 gully plugs. These measures averted erosion losses of up to 150 tonnes of soil per hectare. Grasses, such as vetiver, also were used as barriers across some slopes. Productive, multipurpose tree species and shrubs were planted on agricultural lands, along selected soil bunds. Areas of wasteland were converted to pasture. The demonstration sites satisfied the domestic water needs of the people. The increased soil moisture brought improvements to agricultural production. The project results are sustainable. The lessons learned were incorporated into workshops on watershed management for BAIF personnel, working in other parts of India...|$|E

The house had been built long ago, evidently for a Spanish gentleman of means and taste, and its latest proprietor had sufficient sense to attempt no improvement on its old-world beauty. It stood on a <b>terrace</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hillside,</b> quiet, quaint, and cool, with its ancient, bronze-railed balconies, red-tiled roof, and pink-washed walls, but its garden of palms and oleanders was its greatest charm.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} bench <b>terracing</b> <b>of</b> rainfed <b>hillsides</b> in upland West Java, soil loss rates remain high. This paper reports {{measurements of}} sediment yield from terrace risers and beds and from terrace units made during three consecutive rainy seasons. The results demonstrate that soil loss from the terraces occurs in two stages: rainfall-driven transport by splash and shallow overland flow (wash) from the terrace riser and bed {{to a central}} drain {{is followed by a}} combination of onward wash transport of fine sediment and entrainment by runoff of coarser sediment deposited in the drain. A model (TEST: Terrace Erosion and Sediment Transport) was developed, describing these processes as a function of vegetation and soil surface cover and the presence of a layer of deposited sediment. The model was calibrated using some of the measured sediment yield data and subsequently tested by simulating the remaining data. The results were satisfactory and modelled fractions of sediment transported by splash, wash and flow-driven runoff transport generally compared well with observed fractions of fine and coarse particles in eroded sediment from the various plots...|$|R
30|$|Areas {{reportedly}} experienced {{moderate to}} low soil erosion classes were dispersed {{largely on the}} central and south-western and north-western margins, and some patches at {{the western end of}} the catchment over the studied period. These areas require conservation priorities of fourth and fifth order, respectively. In areas under moderate soil erosion severity class, gully reclamation measures, strip cultivation, grass strips and waterway, contour tillage, construction of stone bunds and <b>terraces</b> and control <b>of</b> <b>hillside</b> grazing would be recommended to reduce soil erosion and environmental damage. In low soil erosion severity areas, the rate of soil erosion is not a serious problem of sustainability, however, farming practices that minimize soil erosion could be practiced to enhance soil fertility, maximize the productivity and long-term sustainability the resource use. Therefore, soil erosion risk mapping is generally useful for identifying soil loss hotspot areas and prioritizing land management interventions (Berhan et al. 2015).|$|R
