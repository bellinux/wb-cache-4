5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the wall.|$|E

40|$|In November 2012, the Gauteng Provincial Government engaged on a {{programme}} {{to demolish}} houses that were illegally built on government land in Lenasia, a suburb located 30 kilometres south of Johannesburg. Over 50 homes were demolished with further <b>demolitions</b> being scheduled. <b>The</b> <b>demolitions</b> spurred various actors into action. Following a court interdict applied {{for by the}} South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) {{on behalf of the}} residents, the government was then forced to cease with <b>the</b> <b>demolitions.</b> Within <b>the</b> dispute various claims have been advanced and legitimation processes entered into. This study uses the case of <b>the</b> <b>demolitions</b> in Lenasia to investigate the nature of legitimation and the framing of claims. This is done through a consideration of the different actors in <b>the</b> <b>demolitions</b> and each of the claims advanced. The central claims of this work are that legitimacy is context-specific and in a state of constant formation. Furthermore, claims are used to express worldviews and they serve as strategic standpoints for access to various goods...|$|R

5|$|The British {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the fortifications {{a number}} of times in the 19th century.

In 1855, Sir John Lysaght Pennefather proposed the construction of a citadel on the high ground of the Sciberras peninsula, on the site of the Valletta Land Front and the surrounding area. In 1872, <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the city's outworks was proposed, while <b>the</b> <b>demolition</b> of the entire land front was suggested in 1882.
