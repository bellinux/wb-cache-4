40|$|A line {{of credit}} or {{overdraft}} is a common contingent lending contract that is an alternative to a fixed or fully drawn loan. The latter has received much attention in empirical and theoretical analyses while the former has received virtually none. In particular, much effort has been put into investigating credit rationing, which {{has been defined as}} occurring when a borrower wants a larger loan than is offered at the ruling interest rate. The meaning of credit rationing in a {{line of credit}} or overdraft regime {{is the subject of this}} paper. An overdraft is the right <b>to</b> <b>overdraw</b> <b>an</b> <b>account,</b> up to a specified maximum and over an agreed period after which time credit limits are reviewed. The borrower pays interest on the credit he uses, which is determined by him up to the maximum allowable. In such a system, the lender faces uncertainty from two sources. First, when the credit limit is established there is uncertainty as to how much credit will actually be used during the life of the credit arrangement. This is significant to the lender because he may have to find cash to cover unexpected fluctuations in realised usage of the credit line. Second, there is uncertainty concerning the borrower’s ability to replay the overdraft loan plus interest when the overdraft contracts terminates. This is the default risk issue that is commonly addressed in the context of fixed loans. There are in effect two distinct demands for credit in an overdraft or line of credit system. First, there is the demand for the credit limit that is available in all contingencies and which is independent of the second demand, which is the actual drawing against the credit limit. This leads quite naturally to two concepts of credit rationing with overdraft, which I shall call ex ante and ex post. Ex ante rationing occurs when a borrower would like a larger credit limit, given his expectations of the interest rate he will be charged, prior to his actual use of the credit limit. That is, the borrower can anticipate the possibility of some situations in which he might face a binding credit constraint. Ex post rationing occurs when the borrower needs more credit than his limit given the interest rate. This paper is concerned with the existence of ex ante credit rationing in a credit market in which there are no interest rate ceilings on borrowers and lenders, and the credit market is assumed to be competitive in that lenders earn zero expected profit. The result is obtained in a simple two period model in which the borrower requires credit to finance a loan project that is subject to diminishing returns (such as a perfect competitor financing production subject to increasing marginal costs) and faces default risk. A further complication is introduced by assuming that the borrower has a random source of revenue during the life of the credit agreement and this random revenue affects his need for credit from the lender. This model is an abstraction from reality that tries to capture three features of real-life line of credit arrangements: (i) such facilities are typically available to borrowers who are financing working capital and whose revenue from the sale of output may be randomly spaced during the time the credit facility exists. (ii) since the borrower’s cash flow is irregular, then to the extent that overdraft credit and retained earnings are the only source of working capital to the borrower any fluctuations in cash flow will have an impact on the demand for borrowed credit. (iii) the credit facility is never established for an indefinite period, but rather is set up subject to review after a finite period. Once established, the limit is not altered until the review date. This abstracts, of course, from any central bank directive concerning limitations on lending rights. In addition to showing the existence of ex ante credit rationing, the paper also considers the impact of an alternative asset for the borrower to invest in in addition to working capital. As expected, the existence of the asset, by increasing the opportunities to the borrower, leads to a demand for a larger credit limit. The effect of a binding ceiling on lending rate is to raise the average rate of credit utilisation and to increase the degree of credit rationing. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) {{has engaged in}} an indepth review of {{short-term}} small dollar loans, specifically payday loans extended by nondepository institutions and deposit advance products offered by a small, but growing, number of depository institutions to their deposit account customers. This review began with a field hearing held in Birmingham, Alabama in January 2012. Both at the field hearing {{and in response to}} a subsequent request for information, the CFPB heard from consumers who use these products. On one hand, some consumers provided favorable responses about the speed at which these loans are given,the availability of these loans for some consumers who may not qualify for other credit products, and consumers' ability to use these loans as <b>a</b> way <b>to</b> avoid <b>overdrawing</b> <b>a</b> deposit <b>account</b> or paying <b>a</b> bill late. On the other hand, consumers raised concerns such as the risk of being unable to repay the loan while still having enough money left over for other expenses,the high cost of the loan, and aggressive debt collection practices in the case of delinquency or default. These discussions and submissions underscore the importance of undertaking a data-driven analysis of the use of these products and the longer-term outcomes that borrowers experience. Because Congress authorized the CFPB to supervise both depository and non-depository institutions, over the past year {{we have been able to}} obtain data from a number of market participants that offer either deposit advance products or payday loans. This white paper summarizes the initial findings of the CFPB's analysis of payday loans and deposit advances. It describes the features of typical payday loan and deposit advance products. The paper then presents initial findings using supervisory data the CFPB has obtained from a number of institutions that provide these products...|$|R

Full dynamic lighting and scenes are possible by tracing and splatting photons, and rebuilding the acceleration structure every frame. We show that the number of view-sample/photon tests can be significantly reduced and suggest further culling techniques based on the normal cone of each node in the hierarchy. Finally, we present an approximate variant of our algorithm where photon traversal is stopped at a fixed level of our hierarchy, and the incoming radiance is accumulated per node and direction, rather than per view sample.

40|$|Prepaid {{products}} {{can become an}} effective instrument for banking the poor, {{as they can be}} used for collecting microdeposits and so operate as <b>a</b> low-cost <b>account.</b> Prepaid platforms have characteristics that make them especially useful for developing low-cost microfinance business models. Indeed, customers using prepaid systems do not need bank accounts or debit or credit cards. Prepaid issuers do not need to develop or invest in new technologies, as this mechanism can be used on a range of platforms, including PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Furthermore, prepaid products are specially designed for offering services demanded by the poor, such as micropayments, microdeposits and even microcredits. Lastly, they allow users to monitor their cash flow by receiving statements (some providers offer this feature online, others provide physical statements) or accessing balances through PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Besides collecting microdeposits, prepaid products (or SVCs as they are called in the United States) offer other services that can be very valuable for serving the unbanked population. As explained in this paper, prepaid products generally lack the identification and credit requirements that effectively bar millions of individuals from opening traditional bank accounts, especially in the United States. Moreover, prepaid {{products can}} be purchased and reloaded at a growing number of locations other than bank branches, such as check cashers, convenience stores and other retailers. Prepaid instruments can also provide immediate availability of funds at a cost that, in some cases, is lower than other alternatives for unbanked consumers.

5000|$|A {{direct debit}} or direct {{withdrawal}} is a financial transaction {{in which one}} person withdraws funds from another person's bank account. Formally, the person who directly draws the funds ("the payee") instructs his or her bank to collect (i.e., debit) an amount directly from another's ("the payer's") bank account designated by the payer and pay those funds into <b>a</b> bank <b>account</b> designated by the payee. Before the payer's banker will allow the transaction to take place, the payer must have advised the bank {{that he or she}} has authorized the payee to directly draw the funds. It is also called pre-authorized debit (PAD) or pre-authorized payment (PAP). After the authorities are set up, the direct debit transactions are usually processed electronically. Direct debits are typically used for recurring payments, such as credit card and utility bills, where the payment amounts vary from one payment to another. However, when the authorization is in place, the circumstances in which the funds are drawn as well as the dates and amounts are a matter of agreement between the payee and payer, with which the bankers are not concerned. In countries where setting up authorization is easy enough, direct debits can also be used for irregular payments, such as for mail order transactions or at a point of sale. The payer can cancel the authorization for a direct debit at any time, and the banker can decline to carry out a debit if the transaction would breach the terms of the bank account out of which payment is to be made, for example if it were to cause the account <b>to</b> <b>overdraw.</b> (Banking law does not authorize a bank to alter the payment amount.) ...|$|R

When the fee for {{a short-term}} payday loan is translated into an annual percentage rate, the implied annual interest rate ranges between 400 and 1000 percent.

Recent algorithms also minimize the overdraw ratios (OVR) (d-e) with little cache degradation.

Our methods are significantly faster than previous approaches (compare timings), and are suitable for run-time execution. We present novel algorithms that optimize {{the order in which}} triangles are rendered, to improve post-transform vertex cache efficiency as well as for view-independent overdraw reduction. The resulting triangle orders perform on par with previous methods, but are orders magnitude faster to compute. The improvements in processing speed allow us to perform the optimization right after a model is loaded, when more information on the host hardware is available. This allows our vertex cache optimization to often outperform other methods. In fact, our algorithms can even be executed interactively, allowing for re-optimization in case of changes to geometry or topology, which happen often in CAD/CAM applications. We believe that most real-time rendering applications will immediately benefit from these new results. ...|$|R
