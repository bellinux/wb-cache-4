It refers to {{the mere presence of}} a weapon or a picture of a weapon leading to more aggressive behavior in humans, particularly if these humans are already aroused. [...] This {{should not be confused with}} the weapon focus, another social psychology finding. This effect was first described by Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony LePage in 1967 in their paper [...] "Weapons as Aggressions-Eliciting Stimuli" [...] in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. <b>The</b> <b>paper</b> <b>outlines</b> an experiment conducted by the authors at the University of Wisconsin.
