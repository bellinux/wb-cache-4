40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the distribution of testicular arterial vessels in caprines with different degrees of scrotal division. Scrotal configurations were classified as follows; Group I: scrotum without bipartition; Group II: scrotum showing a ventral division until the middle of the testis; and, Group III: scrotal separation extended beyond the middle of the testis. A colored vinyl acetate solution was injected into 60 <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> (30 pairs). After, the samples were submitted to corrosion cast method to obtain tubular vascular models for macroscopic analysis. We observed that the <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> emerge from the abdominal aorta, cross the inguinal canal to become coiled and involved by the pampiniform plexus. Close to the caudal extremity of the testis, the arteries become divided in cranial and caudal branches that emit collateral vessels to originate emerging branches. Testicles with intermediate level of scrotal division (group II) showed a smaller amount of those branches than the others, being the most populated the ventrolateral and the dorsolateral quadrants.

40|$|Objective: Thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) is a biologically potent arachidonate {{metabolite}} {{which causes}} vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} presence of TXA 2 receptors in mammalian <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> {{and the influence of}} exogenous gonadotropin administration on their expression. Design: Experimental study. Setting: Experimental animals in an academic research environment. Animal(s) : Seven rams aged 4 - 6 years, weighing 60 - 90 kg. Intervention(s) : Both <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> of seven rams were extracted before (from one testis) and after (from the opposite testis) IV administration of 5, 000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

40|$|In the intermingled {{arteries and}} veins of the retia mirabilia {{leading to the}} swim-bladders of fishes (see Enns, Douglas & Scholander, 1967; Berg & Steen, 1968) O 2 and CO 2 are {{transferred}} from one vessel to another. It has also been suggested that O 2 may pass between the arterial and venous blood in the sper-matic cord (Cross & Silver, 1962) but the similar O 2 saturation of haemoglobin in blood from the femoral and <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> of rams did not support this idea (Setchell & Waites, 1964). However, in most marsupials, the internal spermatic artery breaks up into many branches in the spermatic cord and these branches are interspersed among a similar number of veins (Harrison, 1948, 1949; Barnett & Brazenor, 1958). Countercurrent exchange of gases {{would be much more}} likely to occur with this anatomy than in the eutherian mammals in which the internal spermatic artery remains single until it reaches the testis.

40|$|SUMMARY: The gonadal <b>arteries</b> (<b>testicular</b> or ovarian <b>arteries)</b> emerge {{normally}} {{from the}} lateral {{aspect of the}} abdominal aorta, a little inferior to the renal arteries. Several other sites of origin of these arteries have been recorded with the renal and accessory renal arteries being the most common. In the present case report, the <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> originated from the lower polar accessory renal arteries in both sides. ˚ The testicular veins followed had the usual origin and course, while an accessory renal vein was observed only in the right side. These anomalies were combined with an abnormal left ureter exiting from the lower pole of the kidney. Only one male cadaver among 77 adult human cadavers of Caucasian origin presented this set of variations (frequency: ≤ 1. 3 %). Variations of renal and gonadal vessels are important, as their presence could result in vascular injury of any accessory or aberrant vessel if the surgeon does not identify them.

40|$|Purpose: Irrespective of the {{surgical}} technique chosen to treat high undescended testis, pres-ervation of an adequate arterial supply for the testis {{is crucial for}} successful orchiopexy with maintenance of normal testicular size and texture. To provide an anatomical background for such a procedure, we performed a systematic study on the number and origin of arteries supplying the fetal testis during its migration from the abdomen to the scrotum. Materials and Methods: We studied bilaterally 64 testes from 32 fresh human fetuses 13 to 33 weeks after conception. The fetuses were injected through the thoracic aorta with a microvas-cular silicone rubber red resin {{to fill in the}} arterial tree, thereby enabling identification and dissection of all arteries supplying the testes. Results: Of the 64 testes 3 <b>arteries</b> (<b>testicular,</b> deferential and cremasteric) were found in 46 (71. 9 %), 2 (testicular and deferential) in 15 (23. 4 %) and 4 in 3 (4. 7 %).

5000|$|The scrotum is an {{anatomical}} male reproductive {{structure that}} consists of a suspended dual-chambered sack of skin and smooth muscle that is present in most terrestrial male mammals and located under the penis.

The perineal raphe is a small, vertical, slightly raised ridge of scrotal skin under which is found the scrotal septum. It appears as a thin longitudinal line that runs front to back over the entire scrotum. The scrotum contains the external spermatic fascia, testes, epididymis and ductus deferens. It is a distention of the perineum and carries some abdominal tissues into its cavity including the <b>testicular</b> <b>artery,</b> testicular vein and pampiniform plexus.

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{features of}} the arterial supply to the reproductive system of the male ostrich was studied in 16 pre-pubertal and eight sexually mature and active birds. The left and right cranial renal arteries arise from the aorta, between the cranial divisions of the kidneys.

Accessory <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> which arise directly from the aorta are present in 45. 8 % of the specimens. They supply the testes and cranial parts of the ducti deferentia.

40|$|Sirolimus (SRL) {{is widely}} used to prevent {{restenosis}} after percutaneous coronary intervention. However, its beneficial effect is hampered by complications of thrombosis. Several studies imply that reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{play a critical role}} in endothelial dysfunction and thrombus formation. The present study investigated the protective effect of nicorandil (NIC), an anti-angina agent, on SRL-associated thrombosis. In human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), SRL stimulated ROS production, which was prevented by co-treatment with NIC. The preventive effect of NIC on ROS was abolished by 5 -hydroxydecanoate but not by 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one. NIC also inhibited SRL-induced up-regulation of NADPH oxidase subunit p 22 phox mRNA. Co-treatment with NIC and SRL significantly up-regulated superoxide dismutase 2. NIC treatment significantly improved SRL-induced decrease in viability of HCAECs. The functional relevance of the preventive effects of NIC on SRL-induced ROS production and impairment of endothelial viability was investigated in a mouse model of thrombosis. Pretreatment with NIC inhibited the SRL-induced acceleration of FeCl 3 -initiated thrombus formation and ROS production in the <b>testicular</b> <b>arteries</b> of mice. In conclusion, NIC prevented SRL-induced thrombus formation, presumably due to the reduction of ROS and to endothelial protection. The therapeutic efficacy of NIC could represent an additional option in the prevention of SRL-related thrombosis...|$|R

We evaluated 45 animals: 24 pubescent (8 and 11 months) and 21 mature (≥ 12 months) of age. Males were examined by ultrasound before and after semen collection and seminal glands were biometric measured. We conducted qualitative analysis of accessory glands by the echotexture (homogenitys and heterogenety) and echogenicity (hypo/hyperechoic high and low intensity and anechogenic). Semen had it morphological and physiological characteristics evaluated. Vesicular and bulbourethral glands {{were found to have}} a heterogeneous echotexture, predominantly hypoechoic echogenicity of low intensity. The prostate gland parenchyma presented with homogeneous echo texture compared to other glands and hypoechoic echogenicity.

40|$|Testicular arteries are {{the main}} arteries {{supplying}} the testis. An anatomical variation {{in the course of}} the left <b>testicular</b> <b>artery</b> and left renal artery is presented in this case report, highlighting its clinical implications. The left <b>testicular</b> <b>artery</b> had a high origin from the anterior aspect of the abdominal aorta and took a recurrent course. On reaching the upper border of the left renal vein, it looped over it and descended in front of it. The left renal artery had normal origin and normal course of its proximal half. Thereafter, it arched over the superior border of renal vein and appeared on its anterior surface to reach the renal hilum, causing a mild tortuous course of the artery. This arching of <b>testicular</b> <b>artery</b> and renal artery over the left renal vein might compress the renal vein resulting in renal vein hypertension.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the results of laparoscopic treatment of varicocele and findings of testicular volume and blood supply using color Doppler ultrasound scan on follow-up. METHODS: Fourteen patients aged 7 to 15 years old (median, 12. 3 years) with left varicocele (grade II, n = 4; grade III, n = 10) underwent laparoscopic clipping of internal <b>testicular</b> vein and <b>artery.</b> At follow-up, both testes were scanned by ultrasonography in axial and longitudinal planes, and at least 3 measurements-length, width, and thickness-were taken to calculate testicular volumes. Arterial perfusion of the testes also was assessed. RESULTS: Operating time ranged from 25 to 80 minutes (mean, 60 minutes). There was no perioperative complication. At a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 2 to 39 months) all children were asymptomatic with disappearance of varicocele. The volumes of bilateral testes were equal (difference in volumes less than 10 %) in 9 children. Ipsilateral testicular hypertrophy was found in 3 children. There was no difference in arterial perfusion between the testes in each patient. Small transient ipsilateral hydrocele was observed in 2 patients.
