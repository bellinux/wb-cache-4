5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{on the verge of}} resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 onward, McCarthy {{continued}} {{to exploit the}} fear of Communism and to press his accusations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He also noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|In modern fiction, {{the vampire}} {{tends to be}} {{depicted}} as a suave, charismatic villain. Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, {{based on the belief}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> colluding with vampires.|$|E

5|$|On August 26, Czesław Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, {{declared}} {{on television}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> willing to negotiate, and {{five days later}} he met with Wałęsa. The strikes ended the following day, and on November 30, during a televised debate between Wałęsa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions), Wałęsa scored a public-relations victory.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territories {{marked a}} new era when the {{legislative}} council moved into a newly constructed legislature building on November 17, 1993. The new legislature was the first building built specifically for the Northwest Territories government since the government sat in Regina 88 years earlier. The legislature building was constructed to feature themes derived from the Inuit culture, which signaled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> sensitive to the ethnicity of the resident population.|$|E
5|$|The {{thirteen}} are Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Abdulhadi al-Mukhodher, Abduljalil al-Miqdad, Abduljalil al-Singace, Abdulla al-Mahroos, Abdulwahab Hussain, Hasan Mushaima, Ibrahim Sharif, Mohamed Habib al-Miqdad, Mohamed Hasan Jawad, Mohamed Ismail, Sa’eed al-Nuri and Salah al-Khawaja. They {{were originally}} twenty-one, but seven were tried in absentia {{and one was}} released in April 2012. The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government supporters who oppose any royal pardons.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>was</b> about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E
5|$|Australian rules {{football}} is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1million and $1.5million into the Tasmanian economy.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>was</b> planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|In North Chennai area, {{residents}} staged {{protests and}} criticised {{the state government}} for its lack of any rescue response in their locality. In Puducherry, AIADMK legislator A Anbazhagan said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> not providing relief to affected people and had not taken any precautions, contrary to the government's assurances; he added the administration failed to promptly mobilise various essential departments and urged the territorial administration to carefully prepare a report to ensure delivery of relief to those affected. Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort coordination, a public-interest litigation petition was filed in the Madras High Court; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to suo moto proceedings. The justices directed the state government to report its relief-effort coordination measures to the court by 16 December.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
40|$|Local governments may {{convince}} businesses <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> a reliable, effective partner by {{interacting with}} them constructively. Results from 119 pairs of officials and managers support <b>the</b> theorizing <b>that</b> when <b>governments</b> and businesses {{believe that their}} goals are cooperative, but not competitive, they engage in resource exchange; these ways of integrative interaction in turn lead businesses to conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> competent, caring, and able to regulate industry effectively. These results suggest that cooperative goals and resource exchange are important foundations for successful partnerships between governments and businesses in China and perhaps in other countries as well...|$|R
25|$|Polls also {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public believe even more strongly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> suppressing evidence about UFOs. For example, {{in both the}} cited Gallup and Roper polls, the figure was about 80%.|$|R

5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the possibility {{that there may have been}} more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} {{about whether or}} not to build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky {{and the board of}} the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|E
