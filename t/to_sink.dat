5|$|HMS Forester {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the early 1930s. Although {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939, she helped <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Forester was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar between escorting the aircraft carriers of Force H as they flew off aircraft for Malta and covering convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941.

5|$|HMS Foxhound {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s.

Firedrake participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento and screened the capital ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa before she was damaged by an Italian bomb in mid-1941. After her repairs were completed the ship became a convoy escort in the Atlantic at the beginning of 1942. Firedrake was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in late 1942 with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E

5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold <b>to</b> <b>sink</b> through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for placer mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E
