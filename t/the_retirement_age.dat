5|$|In 1964 Driberg {{published}} a critical study of Moral Re-armament, which brought him attacks from the {{movement on the}} basis of his homosexuality and communist past. Although he made money from this book, throughout the 1960s he was beset by financial problems. When Reynolds News, which had evolved into the Sunday Citizen, finally folded in 1967, he became fully dependent on his parliamentary salary and casual journalism. He had long considered selling Bradwell Lodge, preferably to the National Trust on a basis that would allow him to continue living there. However, the Trust required the property to be mortgage-free and endowed with a substantial fund to cover future repairs, neither of which terms could be arranged. In the event the house remained unsold until 1971. As the 1970 election approached, Driberg wished to retire from parliament, and asked Wilson to appoint him as ambassador to the Vatican. Wilson refused, citing Driberg's age—at 65 he was beyond <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> for senior diplomats. Against his will, but with few other sources of income available to him, Driberg fought the June 1970 General Election. He was returned for Barking with a comfortable though reduced majority; nationally, Wilson's government was defeated by Edward Heath's Conservatives.|$|E

30|$|Having {{determined}} the theoretical framework, {{let us now}} study how <b>the</b> legal <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> is chosen through a majority voting process for a given level of redistribution of the pension system.

30|$|Some notable {{insights}} can {{be obtained}} from the results. We observe that in the two wage distributions <b>the</b> elected legal <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> under <b>the</b> Downsian criterion is higher than that under the Right-wing criterion. The reason is the larger redistribution associated with the Downsian criterion. It is also worth noting the comparison between <b>the</b> optimal <b>retirement</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> poorest and the richest individuals under the two political criteria. In both wage distributions, the larger the redistribution is, the closer to <b>the</b> elected <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> <b>the</b> optimal <b>retirement</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> poorest and the richest individuals will be and, consequently, the lesser the disutility imposed by <b>the</b> mandatory <b>retirement</b> will be.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of an {{increase}} in <b>the</b> legal <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> on <b>the</b> effective <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> in <b>the</b> Netherlands. We do this by means of a dynamic programming model for <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> behavior of singles. The model is applied to new administrative data that contain very accurate and detailed information on individual incomes and occupational pension entitlements. Our model is able to capture the main patterns observed in the data. We observe that as individuals get older their labor supply declines considerably and this varies by health status. We simulate a soon to be implemented pension reform which aims at gradually increasing <b>the</b> legal <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> from 65 to 67. The simulation results show a rather small impact on <b>the</b> effective <b>retirement</b> <b>age.</b> Individuals postpone their retirement by only 3 months on average, while differences across individuals mainly depend on their health status. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Boehner favors {{making changes}} in Social Security, such as by raising <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> to 70 {{for people who}} have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living {{increases}} to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation, and limiting payments to those who need them.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the MTA {{had wanted}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> for newer workers from 55 to 62, but dropped this demand in {{exchange}} for pension contributions from new workers of 6% of gross salary per {{year for the first}} 10 years of employment. Under the previous contract, workers contribute 2% to their pension plan.|$|E
25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>age,</b> rather than {{striking}} to reduce <b>the</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>age.</b> That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms of the pension plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive inflation adjustment for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost of the pension plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E

50|$|CBO {{estimated}} in January 2012 that raising <b>the</b> full <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> for Social Security from 67 to 70 would reduce outlays by about 13%.

Over the long-term, CBO estimates raising <b>the</b> Social Security <b>retirement</b> <b>age</b> increases <b>the</b> size of the workforce {{and the size of}} the economy marginally.
