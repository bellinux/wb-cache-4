5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from <b>the</b> <b>prophetic</b> books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E

25|$|In {{other ways}} <b>the</b> <b>prophetic</b> {{interpretation}} ran into incompatibilities, which were quite marked in apocalyptic thinking.

25|$|This work {{not only}} {{launched}} Merlin {{as a character}} of Arthurian legend: it also created a genre of prophecy.
