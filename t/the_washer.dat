25|$|About {{half a mile}} north are the station's {{cleaning}} facilities, {{which are}} used in the evenings by the units off the TransPennine Express Manchester trains. These first arrive on no.3 platform then go out to <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> and then on to the fuelling point. This happens every night with all four units that are stabled there.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1967 {{there was}} a {{spontaneous}} underground explosion at the Michael; nine workers died and production was halted instantly, and permanently. Only the Lochhead pit remained active, together with the coal washer, and the railway requirements were minimal. Lochhead closed on 27 March 1970, and the only residual traffic was from external collieries to <b>the</b> <b>washer.</b> This could not continue and {{the last day of}} WPR operation was on 26 June 1970.|$|E
25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
50|$|The {{hardness}} of <b>the</b> <b>washers</b> as per <b>the</b> specified limits {{was to be}} 63+- 5 Shore D hardness. Another parameters was {{the load}} deflection characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>washers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} {{replacement}} of <b>the</b> rubber <b>washers</b> with <b>the</b> hytrel <b>washers</b> was that <b>the</b> rubber <b>washers</b> were not lasting {{for the full}} Periodic overhaul cycle of the Railway Coaches which was one year. <b>The</b> <b>washers</b> also had to be replaced in the coaching maintenance depots leading to lifting and lowering of coaches.|$|R
50|$|A {{study was}} carried out on a major {{workshop}} on Indian Railways and {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>washers</b> were having a hardness more than the specified limits. Moreover, the load deflection characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>washers</b> were also not found to be in line with the desired specification.|$|R
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against <b>the</b> <b>washer,</b> sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|E
500|$|In {{the music}} video, Bieber is {{attracted}} {{to a girl}} (Grace Marie Wilson) he sees every day washing clothes at the local laundromat. In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and he picks it up. In the laundromat scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes {{back the next day}} however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her to go on a date with him. He takes pictures of him in situations such as buying chocolate for her and the puppies scene, and others, with notes doting quips of what he would do for her. During the date and ending scenes Bieber has on a white striped collared shirt, with a dark cyan tee. She finally finds him {{at the end of the}} video, and they have their date.|$|E
2500|$|Inkosi: Production 2015–present. [...] Known as the [...] "Chief" [...] in Zulu, the Inkosi {{features}} a large hollow grind, twin over sized washers, a strengthened pivot and sturdy lock up. While challenging {{the standards of}} the Integral Lock®, the Inkosi uses a ceramic ball as an interface for the lock bar to the blade tang for a consistent lock-up. <b>The</b> <b>washer</b> diameter is wider than the blade securing zero sideways play. With larger lubrication holes there is even less surface area of friction. Finally, the large hollow grind provides a shallow radius, for improved strength, making it half way between a flat grind and our standard hollow grind.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the screw}} is {{tightened}} it pushes the Belleville and thrust <b>washers</b> onto <b>the</b> gear/pulley. This creates contact between <b>the</b> <b>washers</b> and ball bearings {{inside of the}} gear/pulley. The friction created by the contact between <b>the</b> <b>washers</b> and ball bearings is, aided by grease (commonly silicone grease), designed so that as one <b>washer</b> moves, <b>the</b> ball bearings rotate.|$|R

40|$|This study sheds {{considerable}} {{light on}} the potential of superelastic shape memory alloy Belleville washers for innovative seismic resisting applications. A series of experimental studies were conducted on washers with different stack combinations under varying temperatures and loading scenarios. <b>The</b> <b>washers</b> showed satisfactory self-centring and energy dissipation capacities at room temperature, although slight degradations of the hysteretic responses accompanied by residual deformations were induced. The hysteretic loops became stable after a few number of cycles, indicating good repeatability. <b>The</b> <b>washers</b> also showed good flexibility in terms of load resistance and deformation, which could be easily varied via changes in the stack combination. Compromised self-centring responses were observed at temperatures below 0 °C or above 40 °C, and a numerical study, validated by the experimental results, was adopted to further investigate the deformation mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>washers.</b> A further phenomenological model, taking account of the degradation effects under varied temperatures, was developed to enable effective and accurate simulation of devices incorporating <b>the</b> <b>washers.</b> Good agreements were observed between the test and simulation results, and the model was shown to have good numerical robustness for wide engineering applications...|$|R
2500|$|Conventional overhead, {{trolling}} or baitcasting type reels usually {{use one of}} {{two types}} of drags: star or lever. The most common and simplest mechanically is the star drag—so-called because the adjustor [...] wheel looks like a star with rounded points. Star drags work by screw action to increase or decrease the pressure on <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> stack which is usually located on the main driving gear. Reels with star drags generally have a separate lever which allows the reel to go into [...] "freespool" [...] by disengaging the spool from the drive train completely and allowing it to spin freely with little resistance. The freespool position is used for casting, letting line out and/or allowing live bait to move freely.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{events in}} 1976 contributed towards {{the launch of}} a {{campaign}} to acquire the Deming Armory as new premises for the town's museum. [...] First, the National Guard vacated the building {{and moved to a}} new facility {{on the south side of}} Deming. [...] Second, a local businessman, Hubert Ruebush, offered to donate his mother's old electric washing machine, the first such washer in Deming, to the museum. [...] When Ruebush learned that the museum could not accommodate <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> in its cramped facilities, he donated $6000 to acquire the armory on the condition that his donation be matched through local fundraising. [...] Ruebush's condition was quickly satisfied, and a delegation from Deming subsequently negotiated a selling price of $11,500 for the building with the State Armory Board in Santa Fe.|$|E
50|$|A {{spherical roller}} thrust bearing is a rolling-element bearing of thrust type that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of <b>the</b> shaft <b>washer</b> that may be misaligned in respect to <b>the</b> housing <b>washer.</b> <b>The</b> misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of <b>the</b> house <b>washer.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare fabric care {{performances}} (i.e., fabric hand, appearance retention, and dimensional stability) after the specimens have been repeatedly washed and dried for up to 20 cycles in three combinations of washer and dryer used (i.e., conventional washer/dryer, HE washer/conventional dryer, and HE washer/dryer). The results showed that the specimens washed in a HE washer had better fabric hand and smoothness. These results suggest that <b>the</b> HE <b>washer</b> was gentler to the washed clothes because it created less mechanical agitation during the wash process than <b>the</b> conventional <b>washer.</b> Although <b>the</b> agitation in <b>the</b> HE <b>washer</b> was less than that in <b>the</b> conventional <b>washer,</b> according to <b>the</b> current study, the washing action was sufficient to remove most stains, except white paint, after one laundering cycle. The effectiveness <b>the</b> HE <b>washer</b> in removing white paint was similar to that of <b>the</b> conventional <b>washer.</b> <b>The</b> current study also showed that the conventional and HE washers performed similarly in color change, dimensional change, and skewness change.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{of the men}} {{and boys}} who worked at the mine came from outside Patterdale, and lodged for the week either with local {{families}} or at Lodging Shops built at the mine. These were simple two-storey buildings with a fireplace (for cooking and drying), tables and benches on the ground floor, and rows of double beds stacked two high on the first floor. The miners were responsible for keeping them clean, but with no floor, and no windows or ventilation upstairs, conditions in them could be very unpleasant, especially in cold wet weather or hot weather. [...] One was built by 1832 and two more by 1839. A large one built in 1859 included a reading room so that <b>the</b> <b>washer</b> boys could be given some education by the miners themselves.|$|E
