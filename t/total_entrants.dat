A record crowd of 14,534 spectators filled the Royal Agricultural Hall, London in May to witness the final between Jim Pike (representing the Windmill Club, Southwark) and Marmaduke Brecon (Jolly Sailor, Hanworth, Middlesex). Brecon ran out the winner by two games to one.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} teams {{entering}} this year’s competition remained the same, with Streatham & Mitcham (hardly a Lancashire club, but useful {{to make the}} numbers up) playing in their second (and {{what was to be}} their final) season.

50|$|With the {{popularity}} of these alternative shorter routes, and responding to {{the growing number of}} cyclists wanting to take part in Australia's biggest one-day challenge ride, the then Bicycle Victoria devised four options for the ride scheduled for 15 October 2006. The organisers expected 9000 participants to choose from the Legend 250 km or the Challenge 210 km ride. Less experienced riders could pick the Classic, which included the West Gate Bridge, or the Bay Ride. A post ride count put the number of <b>total</b> <b>entrants</b> to more than 14,000, raising $440,000.|$|E

50|$|The 1998 {{marathon}} {{established a}} new course, starting at Tsing Ma Bridge and ending at the newly finished Hong Kong International Airport on Chek Lap Kok. The <b>total</b> <b>entrants</b> increased to 6,000 participants.

The route was altered again in 2000, as it started from Hong Kong Cultural Centre, Tsim Sha Tsui, and ended at the Sham Shui Po Sports Ground. The half-marathon was added, alongside the already-existing full marathon and 10 km race.|$|E
50|$|The {{marathon}} {{was first}} held in April 2000 when 3,230 men and 2,589 women completed the event. As popularity {{for the event}} grew, a half-marathon was added in 2002.

The number of participants in the 2008 event exceeded 30,000 <b>total</b> <b>entrants.</b> Unlike some of Nashville's other marathons, e.g. Harpeth Hills Flying Monkey Marathon and Greenway Marathon, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon is a qualifying event for the Boston Marathon.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: O tratamento e os desvios angulares tolerados nas fraturas diafisárias do antebraço em crianças evoca opiniões divergentes na literatura. Frente a esta indefinição, idealizamos este trabalho com o objetivo de avaliar transversalmente os métodos terapêuticos preferenciais para esta lesão durante o 39 º Congresso Brasileiro de Ortopedia e Traumatologia. MÉTODO: Foram respondidos 759 questionários (13 % do total de inscritos). Abordamos os aspectos gerais da amostra estudada para traçar o perfil do ortopedista questionado. Foram expostas duas situações clínicas em indivíduos de 12 (CASO 1) e 5 anos (CASO 2), sendo apresentadas radiografias com fraturas do antebraço destes pacientes. Os dados obtidos foram compilados e submetidos à análise estatística. RESULTADO: O tratamento mais indicado no CASO 1 foi redução incruenta e fixação com fios de Kirschner (26 %), enquanto no CASO 2 foi redução incruenta seguida de aparelho gessado (46 %). CONCLUSÃO: Entre os ortopedistas com menos de 30 anos, a escolha por tratamentos menos invasivos e aceitação de maiores angulações prevaleceu para ambos os casos. Os traumatologistas aceitam menor angulação e tendem aos tratamentos invasivos, particularmente para o CASO 2. Já o ortopedista pediátrico opta por tratamentos menos invasivos e aceita maiores desvios angulares. OBJECTIVE: The {{treatment}} and the angular deviations tolerated in diaphyseal forearm fractures in children evoke divergent opinions in literature. In {{view of this}} controversy, we idealized this study to evaluate the preferred treatment methods for this injury, during the 39 th Brazilian Congress on Orthopedics and Traumatology. METHODS: A total 759 questionnaires were answered (13 % of <b>total</b> <b>entrants).</b> We addressed the general aspects of the study sample to obtain {{a profile of the}} orthopedic surgeons questioned. RESULTS: Two clinical subjects were presented, aged 12 (CASE 1) and 5 years old (CASE 2), along with radiographs depicting forearm diaphyseal fractures of these patients. Data was gathered and submitted to statistical analysis. The overall preferred treatment in CASE 1 was closed reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires (26 %), while in case 2 it was closed reduction followed by plaster cast (46 %). CONCLUSION: Among orthopedic surgeons less than 30 years old, the choice for less invasive treatments and greater acceptance of angular values prevailed in both cases. The traumatologists accepted lower angular values and tended towards more invasive treatments, particularly for CASE 2. On the other hand, the pediatric orthopedic surgeon prefers less invasive treatments and accepts greater angular deviations...|$|E
