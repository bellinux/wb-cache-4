500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E

6000|$|I say {{not that}} {{all things are}} clear to them. How can they be to any finite and created being? They, and indeed angels and archangels, must walk for ever by faith, and not by sight. But if there be mysteries in the {{universe}} still hidden from them, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> has opened the sealed book of God's secret counsels, even the Lamb who is the Lion, and the Lion who is the Lamb; and therefore, if all things are not clear to them, all things at least are bright, for they can trust that Lamb and His self-sacrifice. In Him, and through Him, light will conquer darkness, justice injustice, truth ignorance, order disorder, love hate, till God be all in all, and pain and sorrow and evil shall have been exterminated out of a world for which Christ stooped to die. Therefore they worship; and {{the very act of}} worship--understand it well--is that great reward in heaven which our Lord promised them. Adoration is their very bliss and life. It must be so. For what keener, what nobler enjoyment for rational and moral beings, than satisfaction with, and admiration of, a Being better than themselves? Therefore they worship; and their worship finds a natural vent in words most fit though few, but all expressing utter trust and utter satisfaction in the worthiness of God. Therefore they worship; and by worship enter into communion and harmony not only with each other, not only with angels and archangels, but with all the powers of nature, the four beings which are around the throne, and with every creature which is in heaven and in earth, and under the earth, and in the sea. For them, likewise, St John heard saying, [...] "Blessing and glory, and honour, and power, be unto Him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{children}} were treated equally, and a [...] "father" [...] {{was not allowed}} to show any favoritism, even if he <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> his biological children really were, as biological paternity was not regarded as important.
