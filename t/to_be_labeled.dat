The court found that absinthe was a label for a product and was not tied to a geographic origin.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of her {{departure}} from the serial, Marlena was the fourth longest running Days of Our Lives character. Her outrageous storylines and long suffering nature have led her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> a soap legend and television icon. She is widely known even outside of the Days of Our Lives viewer base. The character is a legend, and is known for reinventing the genre by adding a supernatural mix.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn {{became a}} New York City Landmark, {{making it the}} first city {{landmark}} to commemorate an LGBT icon. The designation prompted Greenwich Village residents to lobby for the inn and the adjacent park <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> a National Monument. Some members of Manhattan Community Board 2 {{wrote a letter to}} the National Park Service, which administers National Monuments, to request such a status for the Stonewall site. The GVSHP also supported a National Monument designation for the site.|$|E

25|$|Wines {{produced}} {{in the region of}} Barsac, such as Premiers Crus Château Climens and Château Coutet are allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness {{is the result of the}} grapes being affected by Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that is commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.|$|E

Queen collaborated with several top-name artist from the hip hop and reggaetón genres including Hector El Father, Fat Joe, Getto & Gastam, La India, Gran Omar and Mickey Perfecto, though this release {{does not have the}} collaborations.

It was her first and only studio album <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> and shipped with the Parent Advisory Warning label.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade {{university}} emerged from the United Kingdom, where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> such a university. In order {{to be considered a}} Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{there was also}} a return to {{painting}} that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and Britain. These movements were called Transavantguardia, Neue Wilde, Figuration Libre, Neo-expressionism, the school of London, and in the late 1990s the Stuckists, a group that emerged late in 1990s respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> neo-expressionism. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Derided as one-hit wonders and {{estranged from}} their {{original}} producer, Rick Rubin, and record label, Def Jam, the Beastie Boys were in self-imposed exile in Los Angeles during early 1988 and were written off by most music critics before even beginning {{to record their}} second studio album, Paul's Boutique. Following the commercial success of Licensed to Ill, the Beastie Boys were focusing on making an album with more creative depth and less commercial material. The group's previous album had been enormously popular and received critical acclaim among both mainstream and hip hop music critics, although its simple, heavy beats and comically juvenile lyrics led it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> as frat hip hop. The group signed with Capitol Records and EMI Records.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not required by law <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but {{it will never be}} unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} police {{was involved in}} various ways in Operation Peace for Galilee, although the bulk of its duties were according to standard procedure. The corps had ample {{time to prepare for}} the operation and very specific designations were made for it {{as a result of the}} lessons learned from the Yom Kippur War (see also: Sectors and operations during emergency). For the first time, it met a friendly population in Lebanon, which often cooperated with the IDF - this created a need for MP presence to prevent the soldiers from making illegal dealings with the locals. Placing road signs was also a major issue, as for the first time a major city (Beirut) needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled,</b> and enemy forces would certainly try to change the signs to mislead the IDF. To counter this, Graffiti was used on the city buildings to indicate direction.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMO) are organisms whose {{genetic material}} has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance {{are a few}} of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled,</b> the US does not.|$|E

Subsequent public statements from company personnel had been contradictory about whether production was to be renewed or planned story elements worked into other products. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> as vaporware, and it was ranked fifth in Wired News annual Vaporware Awards in 2005.

This article provides a brief analysis of how and why this transformation of public discourse in European contexts has taken place, and discusses the consequences of defining immigrants with Muslim background in terms of an essentialized religious identity.

[...] He also stated, [...] "It's relatively simple to click and delete." [...] The debate found the ACLU joining with the Direct Marketing Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported [...] "opt-out" [...] requirements in some cases.

500|$|In New York, the {{original}} law did enumerate cannabis, and {{was passed in}} 1860 following a string of suicides allegedly involving the substances later categorized as poisons. The first draft of the bill 'An act to regulate the sale of poisons' prohibited the sale of cannabis—as with the other substances—without the written order of a physician. The final bill as passed allowed the sale without a prescription {{so long as the}} purpose to which it was issued and name and address of the buyer was recorded, and in addition, all packaging of such substances—whether sold with a prescription or not—had to have the label [...] "poison" [...] on them in uppercase red letters.
