40|$|SUMMARY: We are {{adopting}} a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Model 757 airplanes, Model 767 airplanes, and Model 777 - 200 and- 300 series airplanes. This AD requires repetitive inspections for damage of <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>terminal</b> {{at the left}} and right flightdeck window 1, and corrective actions if necessary. This AD also allows for replacing the flightdeck window 1 with a new improved flightdeck window equipped with different electrical connections, which terminates the repetitive inspections for that flightdeck window 1. This AD results from several reports of electrical arcs at the terminal blocks of the electrically heated flightdeck window 1. We are issuing this AD to prevent smoke and fire in the cockpit, which could lead to loss of visibility, and injuries to or incapacitation of the flightcrew...|$|E

Nowadays, {{there are great}} advancement in the electrical prosthesis. The most physically neutral electrical upper limb amputee prosthesis is myoelectric prosthesis system that use muscle activity from the remaining limb for the control of terminal device or joint movement. Myoelectric prosthesis present in one-way communication which is from the user to the prosthesis. One of the challenges facing prosthetic designers and engineers is to restore the missing sensory function inherit to hand amputation. The user are able to send the signal from the remaining muscle to the prosthesis but the prosthesis {{are not able to}} send the signal back to the user. Therefore, without noticing, the user may exert extra force and can accidently squeeze the object they hold. The objective of this research is to establish two-way communication prosthetic system by developing a prosthetic terminal device with sensory feedback. The terminal device will monitor amount of force exerted on an object and amount of force is translated into vibration that are identifiable by the skin of the user. This prosthesis allows user to control and supply adequate amount of force while grasping object. For the first part, a myoelectric controlled prosthesis, named ‘smartGrip’ that comes with a skin electrode, FSR sensor, vibration motor, microcontroller, battery and electrical terminal device was fabricated. The terminal device reprogrammed with a new setup and control unit.

40|$|RFX is {{a fusion}} machine {{based on the}} {{toroidal}} magnetic confinement. The Ohmic Heating (OH) coils of this machine are fed by a 50 kA current and produce a maximum induction value of 4. 5 Tesla. Four busbar systems feed these coils. Since <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>terminals</b> of <b>the</b> OH coils {{are located in the}} high field region of the machine, both the terminals and the feeding busbars are subjected to a high electromagnetic load, which involves severe mechanical problems. The requirement for a low stray field caused by <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> connections has also to be taken into account. From a preliminary analysis, the most critical points of the structure revealed to be the copper-insulation interface inside the coil terminals and the bolted joints between busbars and coils. The field configuration, together with the geometry of the busbars, gives rise to a very complex load distribution, which required the use of the finite element method to perform a more precise stress analysis.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a time-domain {{technique for}} synthesizing acoustic impedance at the diaphragm of a loudspeaker using a proportional-plus-derivative output feedback. The dynamics of electroacoustic transducers such as moving-coil loudspeakers {{can be readily}} controlled either by direct feedback principle on acoustic quantities, or by plugging a shunt network at <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>terminals.</b> Any conventional loudspeaker first {{intended to be a}} sound transmitter may then become a versatile electroacoustic resonator capable of absorbing (or of reflecting as much) the incident sound energy in a frequency-dependent way by simple electronic controls. Instead of counteracting some unwanted sound by using superposition principle, as is the case for conventional active noise control, such actuator-based strategy aims at monitoring the reaction of a loudspeaker embedded into walls so as to control the proportion of reflected sound waves on this boundary. After a short description of the dynamics of moving-coil loudspeakers giving emphasis on the advantage of electromechanical coupling reversibility, a proportionalplus-derivative output feedback combined to a feed-forward action is proposed for synthesizing of desired acoustic impedance.

30|$|A {{counter-argument}} {{could be}} {{that even though the}} I-V profile is linear and no rectifying junction was intentionally fabricated in the devices, there could be Schottky barriers due to the work function of the Ti electrode [24] or through the localized doping of the MoS 2 (similar to graphene induced doping [25]). If this were the case, the effect would be the same for all of the four electrodes and there would not be any anisotropic behaviour observed. At the same time, if the fundamental mechanism indeed involves the oblique deposition of the MoS 2, we would observe large potential between the ends closest and farthest to the deposition source and minimal potential in the perpendicular direction. To corroborate this hypothesis, we measured the open circuit voltage due to illumination by simply changing <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>terminals</b> in our van der Pauw structure. It is expected {{that the end of the}} specimen closest to the deposition source will have negative while the farthest end will have positive polarity. The two other ends that are equidistant to the deposition source should have the same potential and thus will not show any photo-voltaic effect. Or in other words, the observed photovoltaic effects should be highly anisotropic. As shown in Figure  2 c and d, this is indeed the case. This evidence corroborates our hypothesis since the MoS 2 layers are not expected to show in-plane electrical anisotropy of such large magnitude. The literature contains evidence of thermal anisotropy in 2 D MoS 2 [26], where the degree of anisotropy is around 0.8.|$|R
