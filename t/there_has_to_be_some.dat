When questioned {{on the possibility of}} including worlds based on Disney-purchased properties such as Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm, co-director Tai Yasue said, [...] "We {{have to come up with}} a world that has a lot of originality. We want variety... so we don't want too many of one sort of world, that would look the same. For each world <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> meaning for it, in the plot... Also, gameplay-wise, is that world something that would make gameplay fun?" [...] The game will not feature any worlds based on Final Fantasy.|$|E

In a USA Weekend interview, Hanks discussed how he chooses projects: [...] " [...] A League of Their Own, it can't be just another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow... <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any avenue {{in order to do}} it right". [...] In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, the fan {{campaign}} Voices for Yes {{was launched}} {{to get the}} band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The campaign was headed by two US political operators: John Brabender, senior media strategist for Republican Rick Santorum's 2012 US presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore's 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes {{in the future for}} a [...] "tour everybody dreams of", and cited Yes's nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion. Howe, however, has stated his opinion of Anderson returning, asserting [...] "I'm not sure our mutual desire to achieve the same thing exists any more ... I think <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> element of moving on." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot and {{directed}} by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, [...] "We're still {{trying to work out}} the date for the next video with [...] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not going to lie to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E

[...] "Not in Sommerfeld?"

To qualify as a polymorphism <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> kind of balance between morphs underpinned by inheritance.

This formulaic approach ends in an outcome giving a translated number of seats for each party in Parliament.|$|E

5000|$|The goal in {{relative}} colorimetry {{is to be}} truthful to the specified color, with only a correction for the media.

Media differences are the only thing you really would like to adjust for. Obviously <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> gamut mapping going on also.

5000|$|Typically, a {{work must}} meet minimal {{standards}} of originality {{in order to}} qualify for copyright, and the copyright expires after a set period of time (some jurisdictions may allow this to be extended). Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the United Kingdom <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> [...] "skill, labour, and judgment" [...] that has gone into it. In Australia and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a trademark instead.|$|E
5000|$|A {{generic term}} {{is the common}} name for the {{products}} or services in connection with which it is used, such as [...] "salt" [...] when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> term which may generally be used by anyone—including other manufacturers—to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as genericized trademarks.|$|E
2500|$|With {{reference}} to the EU-India FTA, professor Rajendra Jain of the Centre for European Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University opined: [...] "The reason {{that there was no}} headway in the talks <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> a mismatch of the levels of ambitions and expectations. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a give and take, (...)

5000|$|Baxter {{said that}} the role of Flynn Sullivan appealed to her because it was a break with TV tradition, portraying an [...] "intelligent, capable woman" [...] who [...] "isn't looked at a sexual object or as a target" [...] and [...] "doesn't need to be defended and {{protected}} and rescued." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer described Flynn as [...] "90 percent dignity, 10 percent dizziness." [...] Baxter said she [...] "would love to go with less dignity" [...] but compared the character to Mary Richards: [...] "everyone around her can be a little nuts, but <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> center there that viewers can believe in." ...|$|E

[...] "So <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> kind of mechanism to verify, to do it in an orderly manner.
