Specifically, I first examine the determinants of pre-tax forecast coverage and whether pre-tax forecasts are incrementally informative to investors in evaluating firm performance. Next, I examine whether pre-tax forecasts decrease the transparency of tax-related earnings management. Lastly, I examine how pre-tax earnings forecasts influence management's incentives to avoid taxes. Using I/B/E/S data from 2002 - 2011, I find pre-tax forecast coverage is associated with firm-level tax characteristics. In addition, I find investors utilize pre-tax earnings forecasts in evaluating firm performance, after controlling for after-tax earnings forecasts. In addition, {{the results of this}} study indicate investors more significantly discount earnings which have been managed through the <b>tax</b> <b>account</b> when pre-tax earnings forecasts are available, consistent with increased transparency resulting from detailed forecasting. Lastly, I find some evidence that increases in pre-tax forecast coverage are associated with a decrease in tax avoidance. This result is consistent with a change in management's incentives resulting from the existence of additional performance benchmarks. Collectively, this study provides evidence that pre-tax earnings forecasts are informative in multiple settings. These findings have important implications for academics and practitioners in understanding the role of additional non-EPS income statement forecasts...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the theory underlying the current accounting and reporting standards for deferred taxes and concludes that using the flow-through accounting approach is a better fit for reporting this financial statement item than the asset-liability approach currently required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The authors propose that the underlying issue in accounting for deferred taxes is the unit problem as presented by Carl Devine. To obtain a perspective on the magnitude and behavior of the deferred <b>tax</b> <b>account</b> balances reported by firms, 2, 100 firms in 20 industries were observed approximately over a ten-year period (1997 - 2006). Most firms appear to postpone deferred tax reversals by utilizing tax planning strategies, allowing them to defer indefinitely the requirement to pay tax on earlier timing differences. Therefore, net deferred tax liability balances {{can be thought of}} as possible or remote contingencies rather than probable liabilities. To illustrate the financial consequences of using the approach where the tax expense is equal to the statutory tax liability instead of the expense reported under the current rules, the change in the debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios was computed for the firms in the sample by eliminating the net deferred tax balances from liabilities and adding them to equities...|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{relation}} between a firm's dividend policy and its strategic tax decisions. I posit that the capital market pressure associated with paying a dividend leads dividend-paying firms to seek predictable cash flows. I specifically focus on the volatility of a firm's cash effective tax rate (ETR) due to the observability, large size, variability, and periodicity of cash tax payments. Consistent with dividend payments altering a firm's strategic tax preferences, I find that firms that pay a higher dividend exhibit more predictable cash ETRs. Further, I find that the predictability of a dividend-initiating (eliminating) firm's cash ETR subsequently increases (decreases). Additionally, I find that, consistent with prior research suggesting that financially constrained firms "borrow" cash from their <b>tax</b> <b>account,</b> financial constraint moderates the positive relation between the predictability of a firm's cash ETR and its dividend payments. Importantly, my results hold for firms initiating a dividend {{in response to the}} exogenous shock of the Bush tax cuts. Finally, I also examine specific tax strategies dividend-paying firms use to help increase the predictability of their cash tax payments. My results contribute to the academic literature by examining whether, and how, dividend-paying firms alter their strategic tax decisions. Additionally, I contribute to ongoing public policy debates over the value of dividend payments by demonstrating a positive relation between dividend payments and the predictability of a firm's cash tax payments...|$|E

The purpose of this review was to find the average age at which manufactured housing units in Oregon are decommissioned. A brief review of the literature on this topic that has been published indicated that this question had not yet been answered in the field.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the results of an {{analysis}} of the distributional impact in 1990 of the federal tax and transfer changes introduced by the Canadian government from the time of its election in 1984 through the announcement of its February 1990 budget. The analysis uses Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M). The analysis measures the distributional impact of the federal tax and transfer changes since 1984 by comparing the federal tax and transfer system that will actually be in place in 1990 with the system that would be in place if the 1984 tax and transfer legislation were still in effect, with full indexation through 1990 of exemptions, deductions, and rate brackets. The analysis fully reflects all of the federal tax and transfer changes introduced in the 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989 budgets and in the 1988 tax reform. There were no significant tax or transfer changes in the February 1990 budget. The analysis indicates that in 1990 Canadian households will pay a total of about $ 11. 1 billion more in federal taxes net of transfers than they would pay if the 1984 tax system were still in effect. Increases in net federal income <b>tax</b> <b>account</b> for only $ 0. 9 billion of this total. Federal surtaxes, which account for $ 3. 2 billion, and increases in federal commodity taxes, which account for $ 6. 1 billion, are by far the most important contributors to the increasing net tax burden of the personal sector. The additional net tax burden borne by an average Canadian family in 1990 will be about $ 1, 000. Of the 11. 1 million census families in Canada, 9. 5 million (85 percent) will face higher federal taxes net of transfer than they would face under an extension of the 1984 tax system. Only 1. 5 million (13 percent) will face lower federal taxes net of transfers. The tax and transfer changes introduced are very progressive in the aggregate for families that earn less than $ 35, 000 per year and roughly proportional for families that earn between $ 35, 000 and $ 75, 000. The tax changes become moderately regressive in the $ 75, 000 to $ 1 50, 000 range and severely regressive over $ 150, 000. It is clear that middle-income families, particularly those with children, have borne the brunt of the recent tax increases. Families in the highest income categories have received a less than proportionate share of the increased tax burden, and families with children in the lowest income categories have actually enjoyed tax cuts {{as a result of the}} tax and transfer changes introduced since 1984. Given the size of the federal deficit, further tax increases are inevitable, and the distribution of the growing tax burden must be equitable. Distributional analysis performed with the SPSD/M, of the kind presented in this article, can help to ensure that the public is aware of the distributional impact of proposed tax changes. ...|$|E
40|$|Building any {{online system}} or service {{that people will}} trust is a {{significant}} challenge. For example, consumers sometimes avoid e-commerce services over fears about their security and privacy. As a result, much {{research has been done}} to determine factors that affect users’ trust of e-commerce services (e. g., Egger, 2001; Friedman, Khan, & Howe, 2000; Riegelsberger & Sasse, 2001). Building trustable e-government services, however, presents a significantly greater challenge than e-commerce services for a number of reasons. First, government services are often covered by privacy protection legislation that may not apply to commercial services, so they will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny. Second, the nature of the information involved in an e-government transaction may be more sensitive than the information involved in a commercial transaction (Adams, 1999). Third, the nature of the information receiver is different in an e-government context (Adams, 1999). Some personal information, such as supermarket spending habits, might be relatively benign in an e-commerce situation, such as a loyalty program (supermarket points, or Air Miles, for instance), but other information such as medical records would be considered very sensitive if shared amongst all government agencies. Fourth, the consequences of a breach of privacy may be much larger in an e-government context, where, for example, premature release of economic data might {{have a profound effect on}} stock markets, affecting millions of investors (National Research Council, 2002). E-government services also involve significant privacy and security challenges because the traditional trade-offs of risks and costs cannot be applied as they can in business. In business contexts it is usually impossible to reduce the risks, for example of unauthorized access to information, or loss of or corruption of personal information, to zero and managers often have to trade-off acceptable risks against increasing costs. In the e-government context, because of the nature of the information and the high publicity, no violations of security or privacy can be considered acceptable (National Research Council, 2002). Although zero risk may be impossible to achieve, it is vital to target this ideal in an e-government service. In addition, government departments are often the major source of materials used to identify and authenticate individuals. Identification documents such as driver’s licenses and passports are issued by government agencies, so any breach in the security of these agencies can lead to significant problems. Identity theft is a growing problem worldwide, and e-government services that issue identification documents must be especially vigilant to protect against identity theft (National Research Council, 2002). Another significant challenge for e-government systems is protecting the privacy of individuals who traditionally have maintained multiple identities when interacting with the government (National Research Council, 2002). Today, a driver’s license is used when operating an automobile, a <b>tax</b> <b>account</b> number is used during financial transactions, while a government health card is used when seeking health services. With the implementation and use of e-government services it becomes possible to match these separate identities in a manner that was not being done before, and this could lead to new privacy concerns...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The Ministry of Finance {{issued the}} new China {{accounting}} standards on February 15, 2006 (CAS 2006), which require the listed companies {{to use the}} balance sheet liability method for the income tax accounting. Thus, it give {{us an opportunity to}} investigate the earnings management of listed companies from the perspective of income tax. Under the balance sheet liability method, because conforming earnings management strategies and nonconforming earnings management strategies have different income tax cost and the current income payable will also vary, the listed companies need to choose conforming earnings management and nonconforming earnings management. Our research just try to investigate the relationship between the listed companies’ income tax planning and earnings management on the background of this new system. Design/methodology/approach: Our research approach combines theoretical analysis and empirical analysis. This paper first make a deep theoretical analysis on the listed companies’ choice between pretax earnings management activities that have current income tax consequences (book-tax ‘conforming earnings management’) and earnings management activities that do not have current income tax consequences (book-tax ‘nonconforming earnings management’),and then we exemplify our theory. Next, we come up with two hypotheses based on the theoretical analysis, build up a restatement model and conduct the empirical examination. The empirical analysis employs the method of descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Findings: When engaging in earnings management, listed companies will trade off conforming and nonconforming earnings management from the perspective of income tax cost. We find that managers’ motivations and purposes will influence the choice. On the one hand, when companies are facing the punishment of the suspension or termination of the listing for three consecutive losses, they will have a great incentive to manage earnings in order to turn losses into gains. In this case, companies can’t wait to manage earnings to increase incomes and won’t consider income tax cost too much. And if they employ nonconforming earnings management bringing greater book-tax differences, it may increase the probability of being detected and earnings management behavior may also be found. Thus, in this motivation, listed companies will employ more conforming earnings management. On the other hand, when companies engage in fraudulent activities, they will avoid the use of earnings management strategies which bringing greater book-tax difference to avoid penalty cost associating with fraud being found, since greater book-tax difference will possibly attract regulatory agencies’ and auditors’ attention therefore lead to the fraud being found. In this motivation, listed companies will employ more conforming earnings management. In summary, the main conclusion is when the company has motivations to turn losses into gains and has the motivation to avoid penalty cost associated with fraud being found, the company prefers to employ more conforming earnings management strategies. Research limitations/implications: The limitation in our research is as follows. First, we mainly focus on the conforming and nonconforming earnings management when the listed companies restate their financial statements. However after the issue of CAS 2006, many listed companies still not disclose income <b>tax</b> <b>account,</b> which restrict our sample. Second, without the acquisition of private companies’ data, our empirical results may have some errors. We will solve these problems in our future study. Practical / social implications: Based on the sample of restatement companies, our research explores the listed companies’ choice of conforming and nonconforming earnings management under different motivations, which provides our study with new perspective and theoretical evidence. Meanwhile, because this paper focuses on restate firms’ earnings management, the results are helpful for regulators to strengthen the administration of listed companies’ restatement, as well as decrease the damage of restatement on our capital market. Finally, our results indicate that when the company has motivations to turn losses into gains and has motivations to avoid penalty cost associated with fraud being found, the company prefers to employ more conforming earnings management strategies. It will help us to deeply understand the impact of the accounting processes of income tax under the balance sheet liability method on the listed companies, therefore provide companies’ income tax planning with essential empirical and theoretical evidences. Originality/value: So far, earnings management researches in academia mostly focus on the cost, motivations, means and results of earnings management, there are few studies discuss the choice of earnings management strategies and how different purposes and motivations affect the choice from the perspective of income tax. The issue of CAS 2006 offers an opportunity for this research. This paper use restatement as sample to investigate the choice of conforming earnings management and nonconforming earnings management under different motivations and purposes for the first time. And not only study the effect that earnings management have on income tax, but also study the effect of different earnings management motivations on the choice of earnings management strategies. </p...|$|E
