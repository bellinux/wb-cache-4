5|$|It {{has long}} been presumed that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's {{characteristic}} triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{perception}} that {{different cultures and}} {{regions of the world}} vary in their theology.|$|E
25|$|Each {{country has}} the {{responsibility}} for maintenance of its boundary markers and keeping the clear-cut zone. Most of the maintenance is undertaken during the summer. In August each year <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> inspection of the entire border. The practical responsibility alternates {{between the two countries}} each year. It is carried out by three groups, each which cover a third of the border. Each group consists of two Norwegians and two Russians and the inspection takes two to three days. Afterwards <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> debriefing.|$|E
25|$|Acremant {{also told}} The Oregonian that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> thread to the Ellis and Abdill murders, {{and that of}} Scott George.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, during Esperanto events <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{currency}} used, but {{the management}} has {{stopped at the}} end of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{some debate}} over whether <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> law tort of discrimination. This was {{eventually}} dismissed by the Supreme Court in Bhadauria v. Seneca College.|$|R
25|$|At a {{secondary}} level, for Kordig <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.|$|E
25|$|The PAI-1 gene is SERPINE1, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 7 (7q21.3-q22). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> polymorphism known as 4G/5G in the promoter region. The 5G allele is slightly less transcriptionally active than the 4G.|$|E
25|$|A {{spectrum}} approach, by comparison, {{suggests that}} although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> underlying link, {{which could be}} continuous, particular sets of individuals present with particular patterns of symptoms (i.e. syndrome or subtype), reminiscent of the visible spectrum of distinct colors after refraction of light by a prism.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} was called Pons Belli by the Normans, meaning battle bridge. Rents of freeholders and cottagers {{were recorded in}} 1368 and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> oven recorded the same year.|$|R
50|$|Several {{sources from}} the High Middle Ages suggest that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> Carantanian (that <b>is,</b> Carinthian) {{identity}} that slowly vanished after the 14th century and <b>was</b> replaced by <b>a</b> regional Carniolan identity.|$|R
50|$|In the mid nineties, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{element of}} male nudity and sexualized {{violence}} {{in the work of}} Moscow artists, including that of Osmolovsky. Osmolovsky was the leader of the anti-postmodernist movement, revolutionary Rival Programme NETSEZUDIK".|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{studies on}} Jews {{are part of}} the {{population}} genetics discipline and are used to better understand the chronology of migration provided by research in other fields, such as history, archaeology, linguistics, and paleontology. These studies investigate the origins of various Jewish populations today. In particular, they investigate whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> genetic heritage among various Jewish populations.|$|E
25|$|Scramble {{competition}} {{involves a}} more equal distribution of resources than contest competition and occurs when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> resource pool {{that an individual}} cannot be excluded from. For instance, grazing animals compete more strongly for grass as their population grows and food becomes a limiting resource. Each herbivore receives less food as more individuals compete for the same quantity of food.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese cluster {{with the}} Basques, and these with the Spaniards and the Algerians, as {{data suggest that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> Iberian and paleo-North African origin {{according}} to some studies, showing a pre-neolithic Saharan northwards migration and admixture with ancient Iberians. A2-B7-DR15 is common to those, and the Cornish, Austrians, and Germans, showing a more ancient link between North Africans and western and central Europeans.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ritual {{between the}} Zamindar {{families}} of those days of acquiring high sound titles like Roy, Chatterjee, Banerjee etc. And the surname Roy of Ramendra Narayan Roy <b>was</b> in fact <b>a</b> title. His original surname is Bhawal.|$|R
50|$|Those {{maintaining}} that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> parallel evolution state that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> evidence that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor containing the genetic information for this eye development. This {{is evidenced by}} all bilaterian organisms containing the gene Pax6 which expresses for eye development.|$|R
40|$|Study objectives: Depression {{and falls}} are two common {{conditions}} that impair {{the health of}} older people. Both are relatively underdiagnosed and undertreated problems in primary care. The study objective was to investigate whether <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> set of risk factors that could predict {{an increased risk of}} both falls and depression...|$|R
25|$|For audio communications, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{agreement}} about the BFO oscillator shift of 1.7kHz. A voice signal {{is sensitive to}} about 50Hz shift, with up to 100Hz still bearable. Some receivers use a carrier recovery system, which attempts to automatically lock on to the exact IF frequency. The carrier recovery doesn't solve the frequency shift. It gives better S/N ratio on the detector output.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{agreement}} that disfluencies {{are accompanied by}} important modifications both at the segmental and prosodic levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices {{that are similar to}} other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints. In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because of}} the tourist industry, but mainly to the Ridunians' own {{drinking}} culture (<b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> expression elsewhere in the Channel Islands that Alderney is composed of 'two thousand alcoholics, clinging to a rock'), there are restaurants and public houses. Nightlife includes informal dance music events often taking place in abandoned bunkers ('bunker parties') and more organised events in and around Alderney Week at the Corporation Quarry ('Quarry parties').|$|E
30|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few <b>common</b> {{causes for}} the non-visualisation of the appendix.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 to 1945 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{denominator}} for all {{the national}} universities: {{the tension between the}} de facto government and the reformist sectors that would conform later to the Democratic Union. In October 1943 the administration of Alfredo Palacios was interrupted due to his opposition to decrees issued by the National Executive.|$|R
25|$|Also aboard <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{contingent}} of fifty conscripts who stayed in Bjørnøya for five days. The commission started its work by investigating the wreck and removing the bodies. The deceased were transported to Tromsø, arriving at 13:30 on 1 April. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> memorial service at Tromsø before the deceased were transported {{to their respective}} hometowns for burial.|$|R
25|$|BQP is {{suspected}} to be disjoint from NP-complete and a strict superset of P, {{but that is}} not known. Both integer factorization and discrete log are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{misconception}} that JavaScript {{was influenced by}} an earlier Web page scripting language developed by Nombas named C-- (not {{to be confused with}} the later C-- created in 1997). Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of C-- before he created LiveScript. Nombas did pitch their embedded Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by the ViolaWWW Web browser. Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of C-- in their ScriptEase product and was part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, 96.4% of Mississippi {{residents}} {{five years}} old and older spoke only English in the home, a decrease from 97.2% in 1990. English is largely Southern American English, with some South Midland speech in northern and eastern Mississippi. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> absence of final /r/ and the lengthening and weakening of the diphthongs /aɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ as in 'ride' and 'oil'. South Midland terms in northern Mississippi include: tow sack (burlap bag), dog irons (andirons), plum peach (clingstone peach), snake doctor (dragonfly), and stone wall (rock fence).|$|E
2500|$|According to a royal warrant of 31 October 1786, the Swedish East India Company had {{the right}} to use the triple-tailed war ensign in [...] "Indian waters", when not being under {{immediate}} protection by the Swedish navy. In the merchant fleet, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> practice to illegally use the war ensign to indicate that the ship was armed.|$|R
50|$|The sixth form are {{provided}} with their own <b>common</b> room, featuring <b>a</b> canteen and recreational seating, and an adjacent study centre equipped with computing facilities. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> <b>common</b> room for prefects situated under the headmaster's office in School House. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> <b>common</b> room for Sixth Form English students equipped with computing facilities and recreational seating area.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{practice}} of filming live shows to be broadcast as American television specials, Les Poupées de Paris <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit too risque to air on television. However, the Kroffts did appear on several popular television shows {{to promote their}} live show, including The Jack Paar Show (November 1961) and The Bell Telephone Hour (December 8, 1964).|$|R
25|$|A {{great deal}} of care has gone into the {{construction}} of the Kashivisvanatha Temple in Lakkundi, which deifies Shiva. This temple has a unique feature: a small Surya (Sun) shrine faces the main shrine on the west. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> platform between both, which must have been an open mandapa originally. Hence, the Kashivisvanatha Temple has an entrance on the east side and south side of the mandapa. The entrance doorway and the towers are covered with close intricate carvings. The shikhara (dome) is in the North-Indian style and it looks like a lathe must have been used to make the complex circular pillars.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{sense of}} {{confusion}} between {{the difference of}} PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - {{so much so that}} today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
50|$|During all the 1950s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{belief that}} nuclear energy would have {{provided}} within few years, safely and economically, all the energy needed. Italy ordered between 1956 and 1958 3 different reactors from 3 different companies: Westinghouse, General Electric and Npcc. The reactors were built in Trino Vercellese, Sessa Aurunca and Latina and were all completed by 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> {{misconception}} that they repeated {{words that were}} said around them. This belief most likely stemmed {{from the fact that}} it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few <b>common</b> {{methods for}} filling the mold cavity: gravity, low-pressure, high-pressure, and vacuum.|$|R
