30|$|In recent years, the {{traditional}} methods for heating the roll {{have included the}} induction heating method, resistance wire heating method, and flame heating method [10, 11]. These traditional methods suffer from long heating times and uneven heating, therefore a new model using circular fluid flow to <b>control</b> <b>roll</b> <b>temperature</b> has been designed. This method heats and cools the roll using two tanks. The <b>roll</b> <b>temperature</b> can be <b>controlled</b> by adjusting the velocity and temperature of the fluid. A high precision heat transfer model (between the magnesium alloy sheet and roll) has been built, and the regulation strategy of roll temperature is given, meaning the <b>roll</b> <b>temperature</b> can be <b>controlled</b> within a reasonable range at any time. Therefore, this study can solve the existing problems of large crown, serious wave-shapes, and stuck rolls caused by inaccurate <b>roll</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>control.</b> This will significantly increase the finished production rate of the magnesium alloy sheets.|$|R

Because the quartz flexible accelerometer based on springy support technology is the core sensor in the strapdown airborne gravimeter and the magnet steel in the electromagnetic force equilibrium circuits of the quartz flexible accelerometer is greatly affected by temperature, in order to guarantee the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> precision and minimize the effect of temperature on the gravimeter, the SGA-WZ <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> system adopts a three-level control method. Based on the design experience of the SGA-WZ- 01, the SGA-WZ- 02 <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> system came out with a further optimized design. In 1 st level <b>temperature</b> <b>control,</b> thermoelectric cooler is used to conquer temperature change caused by hot weather. The experiments show that the optimized stability of 1 st level <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> is about 0. 1 ˝C and the max cool down capability is about 10 ˝C.

40|$|Achieving an {{effective}} combination of various <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures {{is critical for}} <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> and crack prevention of concrete dams. This paper presents a procedure for optimizing the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> scheme of roller compacted concrete (RCC) dams that couples the finite element method (FEM) with a sensitivity analysis method. In this study, seven <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> schemes are defined according to variations in three <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures: concrete placement temperature, water-pipe cooling time, and thermal insulation layer thickness. FEM is employed to simulate the equivalent temperature field and temperature stress field obtained under {{each of the seven}} designed <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> schemes for a typical overflow dam monolith based on the actual characteristics of a RCC dam located in southwestern China. A sensitivity analysis is subsequently conducted to investigate the degree of influence each of the three <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> measures has on the temperature field and temperature tensile stress field of the dam. Results show that the placement temperature has a substantial influence on the maximum temperature and tensile stress of the dam, and that the placement temperature cannot exceed 15 °C. The water-pipe cooling time and thermal insulation layer thickness have little influence on the maximum temperature, but both demonstrate a substantial influence on the maximum tensile stress of the dam. The thermal insulation thickness is significant for reducing the probability of cracking as a result of high thermal stress, and the maximum tensile stress can be controlled under the specification limit with a thermal insulation layer thickness of 10 cm. Finally, an optimized <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> scheme for crack prevention is obtained based on the analysis results...|$|R
