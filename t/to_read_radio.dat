50|$|Spanning almost 30 years, {{his career}} at the ABC ended with his {{retirement}} in 1983. His last broadcast was on 10 June of that year. However, in 1992 he returned <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the 8pm <b>radio</b> news from 1932 during a broadcast marking the 60th anniversary of ABC Radio.|$|R
50|$|Her {{association}} with the ABC began when she joined its announcing staff in 1967. Since then she has overcome major barriers to the accepted roles for women in broadcasting. On 15 October 1975 {{she became the first}} woman <b>to</b> <b>read</b> national <b>radio</b> news since World War II, and in 1978 she was the first woman to present national television news. She has presented a variety of music and current affairs programs and won a devoted audience for her high-rating morning program, The Margaret Throsby Show, on ABC's Radio 2BL.|$|R
50|$|After {{moving to}} Dublin O'Doherty {{applied for a}} {{position}} as an announcer with Radio Éireann and was accepted. He started out presenting music shows such as Hospital Requests and Today in the Dáil. During a newspaper strike in 1966 he was invited <b>to</b> <b>read</b> both <b>radio</b> and television news bulletins. Over {{the next two decades}} {{he became one of the}} most recognised faces and voices in Irish broadcasting. His unscripted and humorous asides that he would slip into his bulletins also became popular, much to the ire of the RTÉ authorities. He also became famous for announcing the death of Eamon de Valera on RTÉ on 29 August 1975. In 1983 O'Doherty announced his retirement from the state broadcaster, blaming bad working conditions. He subsequently toured the country as a comedy act before moving to Paris.|$|R

50|$|Low-cost passive RFID tags were {{designed}} to uniquely identify each item manufactured. In contrast, bar codes for trade items and consumer products have limited capacity and typically only identify the manufacturer and class of products. Although RFID tags are currently still more expensive than a simple optically readable label, they offer additional capabilities {{such as the ability}} <b>to</b> be <b>read</b> by <b>radio</b> waves, without requiring 'line of sight' between the reader or interrogator and the tag; this enables individual items within a large cardboard box (case) <b>to</b> be <b>read</b> without first unpacking each individual item from the box. Some RFID tags offer additional read/write user memory {{that could be used for}} storage of additional information, such as an expiry date or date of manufacture.|$|R
50|$|In {{the over}} 80 {{years since the}} {{independence}} of the South, efforts to revive Irish as an active daily vernacular of most of the nation have relied on compulsion and have generally failed. More and more people are becoming passive speakers of Irish (who watch Irish-language TV, listen <b>to</b> Irish-language <b>radio,</b> <b>read</b> Irish-language newspapers and magazines) with an estimated 10% (400,000+) {{of the population of the}} Republic who would be classified as fluent, near fluent or reasonably good passive speakers.|$|R

Yet Norma too has lost during the war: her husband disappeared on a trip to a jungle village called 1797.

40|$|Rhythm {{is central}} <b>to</b> news <b>reading</b> in <b>radio</b> and {{television}} programs. This paper proposes a three level structure for rhythm in news discourse. It gives a comprehensive definition of rhythm {{and types of}} rhythm. Firstly, the Base Rhythm Structure consists of semantic and pragmatic rhythmic accents, coincident with very specific words. Secondly, these accents are grouped together according to type, frequency and order, thereby configuring three types of “rhythmic units” (the Internal Rhythm Structure) : starting, main and end units. A last structure level presents four discursive factors that are very important in integrating the overall time structure of news announcing (the Melodic Rhythm Structure). This integral structure for news announcing rhythm should be further tested in acoustic-experimental studies under the criterion of information transmission efficacy. </p...|$|R
50|$|WRBH {{began as}} {{the dream of}} a local mathematician, Dr. Robert McClean. He was blind, but he had a vision: a FM <b>reading</b> <b>radio</b> station, with strong {{programming}} content that would improve the lives of blind and visually impaired persons for productive, fulfilling lives. In 1975, McClean began leasing airtime from WWNO and renting studio space from New Orleans’ Lighthouse for the Blind. By 1982, his efforts expanded after purchasing the 88.3 FM wavelength, officially making WRBH the United States’ first 24-hour FM <b>reading</b> <b>radio</b> station for the blind. Today, WRBH remains the USA’s only full-time FM <b>reading</b> <b>radio</b> service and is one of only three such stations in the world.|$|R
50|$|In December 1960, the Imperial Guard (Kebur Zabangna) {{launched}} a coup d'état and seized power in Ethiopia while the Emperor {{was on a}} visit to Brazil. The coup leaders compelled the Crown Prince <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a prepared <b>radio</b> statement. In the statement, he accepted the crown in his father's place and announced a government of reform. However, the regular Army and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church both refused to accept the new government. The leader of the church, Patriarch Abuna Basilios, issued an anathema against all those who cooperated with the coup leaders. The Emperor returned to Ethiopia and the Army stormed the palace where members of the government were being held prisoner by the Imperial Guards. The Guards fled, but not before killing many members of the government and the nobility that had been held prisoner in the Green Salon of the palace. Leul Ras Seyoum was among those who were machine gunned to death, he was 74 years old and was buried in Axum.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December 1960, the {{commander}} of the Imperial Guard, Mengistu Neway, with his brother Germame Neway launched a coup d'état and seized power in Ethiopia while the Emperor was on a visit to Brazil. The coup leaders detained Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in the Imperial Palace, and the following morning, having secured control over most of the capital, then compelled the Crown Prince <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a <b>radio</b> statement, in which he accepted the crown in his father's place and announced a government of reform. However, the regular Army, led by Dejazmach Asrate Medhin Kassa and Chief of Staff, Major General Mared Mangesha, spent the following day gaining control of other military formations, as well as the Air Force; later that day Patriarch Abuna Basilios of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, issued an anathema against all those who cooperated with the rebels. On 15 December fighting broke out in the city, and the rebels were driven out of Addis Ababa; before retreating the rebels slaughtered many members of the government and the nobility held hostage in the Green Salon of the palace. Among the dead were Abebe Aregai and Seyum Mangasha. The Emperor returned to Ethiopia, entering the capital on 17 December. Although it was explained that the Crown Prince had acted under duress, his outlook had long been regarded as considerably more liberal than that of his father, and so he would always be suspected of having been a willing participant in the coup attempt. By contrast, Medferiashwork Abebe, the wife of the Crown Prince, is credited with playing a role against the coup attempt.|$|R
