5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for <b>Time</b> <b>After</b> <b>Time,</b> Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E

With large French relief armies approaching Burgos from the northeast and Madrid from the southeast, the British commander withdrew to the west, abandoning large areas of Spain that had been recently liberated. That fall the French lost an opportunity to defeat Wellington's army. Nevertheless, during the withdrawal to Portugal the Anglo-Portuguese army lost many men to pursuing French cavalry and starvation.|$|E

25|$|In <b>Time</b> <b>After</b> <b>Time,</b> H.G. Wells invents a {{time machine}} and shows it to some friends {{in a manner similar}} to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which {{prevents}} the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Their {{friendship}} {{was also}} a working partnership; in all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; {{it is possible to}} discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. <b>Time</b> <b>after</b> <b>time,</b> when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.|$|E

25|$|A ki' pohaku ({{petroglyph}}) of {{a turtle}} (or honu) {{can be found}} on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>time.</b> This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could {{take the form of a}} girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight of}} the great grey shrike is undulating and rather heavy, but its dash is {{straight}} and determined. It is, as noted above, also capable of hovering flights, which last briefly but may be repeated <b>time</b> <b>after</b> <b>time</b> because of the birds' considerable stamina. It will usually stay low above the ground in flight, approaching perches from below and landing in an upward swoop. In social interactions, birds signal an aggressive stance by a bold upright posture, fanning and then flicking the tail and eventually the wings also as the bird gets more excited. It signals its readiness to strike at an intruder by shifting to a horizontal pose and fluffing its feathers, raising them into a small crest {{along the top of}} the head. Birds appease conspecifics by head-turns away from them (if close by), or by imitating the crouching fluttering pose and calls given by fledglings begging for food (if sitting father apart). The submission gesture to prevent an imminent attack by a conspecific is pointing the beak straight up.|$|E

[...] One of Meyer's earlier films, <b>Time</b> <b>After</b> <b>Time,</b> was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from <b>Time</b> <b>After</b> <b>Time.</b>|$|E

In 1804, after French Revolutionary Troops had conquered the Left Bank of the Rhine for the French state, the nobility and the church had their estates seized and their land auctioned. As a result, the dilapidated Winzingen Castle and its surrounding land went into private ownership. The wealthy Neustadt businessman, Schuster, converted the estate at considerable expense into a park-like gardens and built {{the remains of the}} medieval palas into a wine press hall.|$|R
