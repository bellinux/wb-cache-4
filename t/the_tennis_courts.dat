5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog survives {{in some areas}} of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the {{proposed}} site for <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). When the green and golden bell frog was found there, <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the {{airfield}} {{was occupied by}} the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts and cleared the area of obstacles as {{it was intended to}} use the area as an Emergency Landing Ground. Three pillboxes were erected around {{the airfield}}'s perimeter. Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> were off-limits.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on the north end of <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts,</b> while {{the north side of the}} outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{site was}} then {{sold by the}} Commissioners to Deddington's parish council. The parish council {{intended}} to build tennis courts in the inner bailey of the castle in 1947 but, when work began, medieval pottery and roof tiles began to be unearthed by the builders. Construction work was halted and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford sponsored an archaeological investigation by Edward Jope and Richard Threlfall that continued until 1953. The plans for <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> were dropped {{in light of the}} findings, and the site was instead used as a park. A further phase of archaeological investigation of the castle was carried out between 1977 and 1979, sponsored by the Queen's University Belfast and led by Richard Ivens.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E

Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) The {{research was}} designed to compare the effect of two environments on the learning of <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> forehand drive by beginner players. The subjects, 29 fifth and sixth grade boys and girls, {{ranging in age from}} 10 years and 1 month to 12 years and 6 months, were divided into three groups for the four-week study. Two experimental groups and one control group were pretested and post tested on <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> forehand drive. Group 1, the control group, did not receive tennis instruction and returned to regular physical education classes. Group 2 received instruction for the forehand drive on the backboard. Group 3 received instruction on <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court.</b> <b>The</b> scores obtained from the pretest and the post test were analyzed by an ANCOVA and Tukey's post hoc test. The results showed no significant difference between Group 1 (the control group) and Group 2 (learned on the backboard). A significant difference (p<. 01) resulted between Group 1 (the control group) and Group 3 (learned on <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court)</b> in favor of Group 3. A significant difference (p<. 10) occurred between Group 2 (learned on the backboard) and Group 3 (learned on <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court)</b> with Group 3 learning significantly more. It was concluded that the skill learned on the backboard did not transfer to <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court,</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> is <b>the</b> more appropriate environment for learning the forehand drive as taught in this study...|$|R

50|$|The Japanese who {{had been}} {{fighting}} to capture Kohima did not retreat at once, many of them stayed in the positions which they had captured and fought tenaciously for several more weeks. It is not entirely clear when the battle for <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> was won, however it seems that tanks operating from the road supported an infantry attack that captured <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> area on 10 May 1944. By the morning of May 13, most of the positions on the Kohima ridge had been re-taken by the British and Indian forces. On that day the DC's bungalow was finally recaptured by the 2nd Battalion, Dorset Regiment supported by Grant tanks firing from <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> lead tank was driven by Sergeant Waterhouse of 149th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (149 RAC), firing his 75mm main armament into Japanese bunkers at no more than 20 yards range. This tank was supported by two platoons of the Dorsets commanded by Sergeants Given and Cook. This Allied breakthrough that ended the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> is depicted in a 1982 painting by Terence Cuneo which is displayed in the Kohima Museum in Imphal Barracks, York.|$|R
