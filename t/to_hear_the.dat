5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control.

5|$|Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Raymond C. Fisher and Richard R. Clifton (nominated to {{the court}} by presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W.

She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
