5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control.

5|$|Judges Stephen Reinhardt, Raymond C. Fisher and Richard R. Clifton (nominated to {{the court}} by presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W.

She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges.

Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
