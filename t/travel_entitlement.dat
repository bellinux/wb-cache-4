40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the post retirement travel entitlements provided to former parliamentarians, discusses recent policy developments and provides links to material that explains retirement travel in greater detail. IntroductionFormer parliamentarians {{are provided with}} a post retirement travel, severance travel or Life Gold Pass (LGP) entitlement depending on when they entered or retired from the Parliament {{and the length of}} their service in the Parliament. Retirement travel, like other parliamentary entitlements, is governed by legislation, determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal, procedural rules and decisions of the Executive. Recent reforms to retirement travel aim to limit the benefits: closing off the entitlement to the LGP to prospective members of parliament and limiting the entitlement to severance travel by former senators and members. Following the recommendations of the Committee to Review Parliamentary Entitlements (Belcher Review) the Remuneration Tribunal (The Tribunal) conducted a work value assessment of parliamentary remuneration. The Tribunal released its initial report on the 15 December 2011 and made a statement outlining its recommendations. The recommendations included:the prospective closure of the LGP schemetermination of the present Overseas Study <b>Travel</b> <b>entitlement</b> andgreatly limited severance travel entitlementThe Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Tribunal and introduced the necessary legislation in February 2012.

40|$|If {{opinion polls}} {{are to be}} believed, {{politicians}} in Australia barely rate above car salesmen and real estate agents for their honesty and integrity. Should we be appalled by this lack of {{public confidence in the}} integrity of our members of parliament? Should we be concerned with the viability of our parliamentary system of government? Are we endangering our prosperity by failing to address this betrayal of our public trust? The media at times arouse such anxieties, despite their own integrity rating being little better than that for politicians. A measured response to these concerns is that a good dose of public scepticism of politicians is perfectly natural, even in a democracy, given the political nature of their office. The vast majority of politicians are essentially honest men and women with a commitment to public service. Nonetheless, instances of misconduct by a few, whether this be political abuse of <b>travel</b> <b>entitlements,</b> the misuse of parliamentary privilege, conflicts of interest, or the acceptance of post-ministerial consultancies, compound this inherent public distrust of politicians. So the integrity of politicians comes under fire from two directions: their personal as well as their political integrity. Consequently, an effort is needed to reinforce both these forms of integrity. This chapter explores the development and effectiveness of those efforts in Australia. © Copyright 2007 Federation Pres...|$|R

He had {{also served as a}} Parliamentary Secretary, Whip and Committee Chairman in the Howard government. In April 2012, he stood aside briefly as Speaker resuming the position after he released copies of cabcharge vouchers showing there was no substance to allegations made by James Ashby in court documents which were later withdrawn by Ashby. After the investigation into his use of <b>travel</b> <b>entitlements</b> was widened to investigate matters not alleged by Ashby, he announced to the House that he would not take the chair for the time being. On 9 October 2012, a motion of no confidence in Slipper as Speaker of the House was narrowly defeated. He resigned as Speaker several hours later. In December 2012, Slipper successfully argued that sexual abuse charges levelled at him were vexatious, and the case was dismissed. However this decision was successfully appealed before the full bench of the Federal Court, so the case appeared in 2014, however Ashby later abandoned the claims. In July 2014, Slipper was convicted by the ACT Magistrates Court of defrauding the Commonwealth over the alleged use of Cabcharge vouchers involving $954 whilst touring several wineries in 2010—matters not alleged by Ashby. He appealed the conviction, and in February 2015, the Supreme Court of the ACT upheld the appeal and ordered that the convictions and sentence be put aside and a verdict of not guilty be entered.|$|R

40|$|Transcript Tonight I rise {{to invite}} Prime Minister Tony Abbott {{to visit the}} {{beautiful}} state of Western Australia. I do this in good faith, because we are {{only a matter of}} weeks away from a historic by-election that will not just determine the final makeup of this chamber after July but also will decide much more of consequence to the people of Western Australia, whether they are thinking of voting for the Greens or not. Prime Minister, you are welcome out west, but this is a respectful invitation to think carefully about what baggage you pack when you make your next flying campaign stopover. When you arrive at Perth airport, you will alight on the traditional country of the Whadjuk Nyoongar people, who have sung this country for more than 40, 000 years. This is 200 times the age of the city that now stands {{on the banks of the}} Derbal Yerigan, the Swan River. Understand that you are now closer to Denpasar than to Western Sydney, in a state where an entire generation has been priced out of affordable housing. Recognise that you are standing in a place where the drought never ended, where climate change from land clearing and fossil fuel combustion is a lived reality that is already costing jobs, property and lives. Mr Prime Minister, at your next press conference we invite you to leave your excruciatingly boring three-word slogans at home. If your image of Western Australia is of some caricatured redneck backwater that is enjoying the murderous horror unfolding on Manus Island, you are reading us wrong. Every time you refer to us as the 2 ̆ 7 mining state 2 ̆ 7 as though the western third of our ancient continent is just Gina Rinehart 2 ̆ 7 s inheritance to be chopped, benched and blasted, you are reading us wrong. Western Australians are a generous and welcoming lot, but if you arrive and start talking proudly about your attempts to bankrupt the renewable energy sector, cripple the independence of the ABC and privatise SBS, if you show up waving your homophobia in people 2 ̆ 7 s faces and start boasting about your ever-more insidious attacks on the trade union movement and all working people, you can expect a very different kind of welcome. People are under enough pressure as it is without three years of this government going out of its way to make it worse. It looks awkward when you take policy advice on penalty rates and the minimum wage from mining billionaires and media oligarchs on the other side of the world-awkward, and kind of revolting. It is good to remember that these things are temporary. For anyone listening in from outside this almost empty Senate chamber, the truth is that Prime Minister Tony Abbott and this benighted attempt at a government are a temporary phenomenon. They will pass, and we need to keep our eyes on the bigger picture. Just as the reign of the dinosaurs was cut short to their great surprise, it may be that the Abbott government will appear as nothing more than a thin, greasy layer in the core sample of future political scientists drilling back into the early years of the 21 st century. The year 2014 marks 30 years since the election of the first representative of what was to become the Greens-my dear friend and mentor Senator Jo Vallentine. She came into this place as a lone Western Australian representative speaking out against the nuclear weapons that formed the foundations of the geopolitical suicide pact we dimly remember as the Cold War. Since the first day of Senator Vallentine 2 ̆ 7 s first term, the Greens have been articulating a vision of Australia as it could be-an economy running on infinite flows of renewable energy; a society that never forgets it lives on country occupied by the planet 2 ̆ 7 s oldest continuing civilisation; and a country that values education, innovation and equality. These values are still at the heart of our work; nowhere stronger than on the Walkatjurra Walkabout, which will set off again later this month to challenge the poisonous imposition of the state 2 ̆ 7 s first uranium mine on the shoreline of Lake Way. As the damage done by the nuclear industry is global, so is our resistance. Mr Abbott, your thoughtless cancellation of half a billion dollars of Commonwealth funding for the Perth light rail project has been noted. Your blank cheque for Colin Barnett 2 ̆ 7 s bloody and unnecessary shark cull has been noted. Your attacks on Medicare, on schools funding, on tertiary education-noted. The fact that your only proposal for environmental reforms thus far is to leave Minister Greg Hunt playing solitaire for the next three years while you outsource his responsibilities to the same Premier who presides over the shark cull has been noted too. You may not believe this, Prime Minister, but your advocacy on behalf of foreign biotechnology corporations and Hollywood 2 ̆ 7 s copyright-industrial complex to chain Australia to the Trans-Pacific Partnership has been noted. People have been keeping a record of every time you have been given the opportunity to choose between predator capitalism and the public interest, and it is bitterly obvious whose side you are on. So to be very blunt, the reason that I extend this invitation to you, Mr Prime Minister, to spend as much time as you can spare in Western Australia is that every time you open your mouth the Green vote goes up. You and your financial backers in the gas fracking and uranium industries have inspired hundreds of people to spend their precious time doorknocking thousands of homes for the Greens in the last few weeks. Your decision to back Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders instead of Western Australian farmers has inspired people across the length and breadth of this country to make thousands of calls and donate to our campaign. As for the premeditated destruction of the NBN and Attorney-General George Brandis 2 ̆ 7 s degrading capitulation to the surveillance state when confronted with the unlawful actions of the US NSA-even the internet is turning green, 2 ̆ 7 for the win 2 ̆ 7. Geeks and coders, network engineers and gamers would never have voted Green in a million years without the blundering and technically illiterate assistance of your leadership team. For this I can only thank you. And, perhaps most profoundly, your determined campaign to provoke fear in our community-fear of innocent families fleeing war and violence in our region-in the hope that it would bring out the worst in Australians is instead bringing out the best in us. Prime Minister, you are welcome to take your heartless racist exploitation of people 2 ̆ 7 s fears and ram it as far from Western Australia as your taxpayer funded <b>travel</b> <b>entitlements</b> can take you. What is at stake here, in the most immediate sense, is whether or not Prime Minister Tony Abbott has total control of this parliament in coming years. But I have come to realise that it is about much more than that. We want our country back. Through chance, misadventure, and, somewhere, a couple of boxes of misplaced ballot papers, we have been given the opportunity to take back just one seat on 5 April, and a whole lot more in 2016. Game on, Prime Minister. See you out west...|$|R

40|$| review, {{which led}} to {{minor changes to the}} paperwork, alerted the {{government}} {{to the fact that the}} scheme was already honoured more in the breach than in the observance. In particular, it appeared that lobbyists were only rarely asked to show their letters of registration when dealing with ministers and their offices. Few enquiries were directed to the registrar. Subsequently the responsible minister, usually a junior member of the front bench, regularly and formally requested all ministers to alert their staff and their departments to the requirements of the scheme. One minister went further than this. Senator Nick Bolkus, Labor’s minister for administrative services, 1990 - 93, was attracted to the idea of strengthening the scheme after learning of US and Canadian regulations during a trip to Washington. He was particularly impressed by the thinking behind the 1989 Canadian scheme, which had been introduced after the Australian scheme was created. He was also sensitive to media criticism that Canberra’s scheme was a sham. He judged that, despite his best efforts (and those of his predecessors), the scheme was often ignored. Bolkus took a submission to cabinet in mid 1991 for a new legislative scheme to be introduced during the August 1991 budget sittings of parliament. This legislation would have made the registration scheme more comprehensive, established the register as a public document and introduced penalties for non-compliance. The coverage of lobbyists would have been extended to employees of organisations such as associations and corporations. MPs would also have been included among those targets to be registered. The initiative was justified on the grounds of public interest and public accountability. There was some increased expenditure, but within the departmental budget allocation. The submission was unsuccessful and the idea died. It had few strong supporters anywhere in cabinet, the bureaucracy or the parliamentary party. The economic departments were opposed. It appears that the government saw few obvious benefits and feared criticism from the lobbying industry. Six months after the Howard government took office in March 1996, lobbyists with an active entry on the register received a letter from the registrar. Following a review of the operation of the registration scheme, he wrote, the government had decided to abolish it. The decision had been made, according to the registrar, after the government had taken into account “both changes which have taken place in the lobbying industry since 1984 and the general changes which have evolved in government processes and the role of parliament to ensure that relevant community and business interests are consulted in the decision making process” - hardly an informative explanation. The responsible minister, David Jull, was more candid on 21 November when he gave a brief answer to a friendly question from a government backbencher in the House of Representatives. “[F]rankly,” he said, “it was a toothless tiger and its provisions were really unenforceable. ” He gave three reasons for abolition in addition to the general rationale given by the registrar. First, “the requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. ” This certainly appeared to be true of one aspect of the scheme: in the three years prior to the government’s coming to office only eight enquiries had been made to the registrar. Second, there had been “quite a bit of criticism that the register was not available for public scrutiny. ” This could easily have been rectified. Third, “the scheme was an unnecessary hindrance to the business sector. ” The first two reasons go to the heart of the matter. In its existing form the scheme was a dead letter. Given that reality, then Jull’s third reason was nonsense, as an unenforceable scheme puts no strain on anyone, though as an explanation it was perhaps superficially appealing to the government’s business clientele. The scheme either had to be strengthened, perhaps along the lines proposed earlier by Senator Bolkus, or dropped. The Liberal Party had never supported it. The incoming government was seeking public sector cuts and aiming to remove “red tape. ” The Department of Administrative Services had little enthusiasm for the scheme which was administered, ironically, from within its awards and national symbols division. Public reporting was confined to the annual reports of the relevant departments: the Department of the Special Minister of State until 1987, then the lowly ranked Department of Administrative Services. Only a few lines in the annual report of the relevant department were devoted to the scheme each year, and over the decade the trickle of information virtually dried up. Until 1987 the department provided the number of lobbyists and clients registered each year; after 1987 it provided only the number of lobbyists; and after 1991 it ceased to provide any figures at all. This apparently suited the government, the opposition, the department and the lobbyists themselves. Advocates of open government seem not to have been concerned to pressure the government for more information. The number of registered lobbyists on the general register grew from 151 at 30 June 1985 to 238 in July 1991, while the number on the special register of lobbyists representing foreign clients grew from 22 to 33 over the same period. We do not know the extent of overlap, but it was possibly extensive. The number of clients for about the same period, 1985 - 91, increased on the general register from 601 to 917 and on the special register from 31 to 49. This indicates an independent commercial lobbying industry of a size in keeping with public knowledge and expectations. Most of these lobbyists were consultants, with a small number of lawyers, accountants and customs agents. The special register included 27 individual foreign countries represented by lobbyists. The only other figures available were those for the number of enquiries to the registrar, which the minister, David Jull, provided in November 1996. The eight enquiries made by ministers, ministerial staff or departmental officers over three years from 1993 to 1995 were tabled as evidence that the “requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. ” Yet they can also be seen as evidence of a limited scheme operating according to expectations. Officeholders would only contact the register if they were taking the scheme seriously or if something was amiss. Given the purpose of the scheme, this was unlikely. The registrar himself, in 1995, argued that the idea of registration was to “erect a watch-tower but for the time being to leave it open. ” There is no evidence that the national interest provisions of the special register were ever acted on. Since the scheme was abandoned there has been little expressed interest in the regulation of lobbying. In March 2004, however, the new Labor opposition leader, Mark Latham, did propose a new transparent scheme involving a register of lobbyists and their clients and a code of conduct for lobbyists, with all of the information available to the public on the internet. In this case, there had been no scandal to focus attention on the growing industry. The government’s problems had centred instead on the conduct of its ministers and parliamentary secretaries, several of whom had been dismissed over conflicts of interest and the misuse of <b>travel</b> <b>entitlements.</b> Attention was focused on ministers themselves rather than on those who lobbied them, so Latham’s proposal excited little public interest and no response from the Howard government. The public interest would have to wait for another scandal. • John Warhurst is professor of political science at the Australian National University.
