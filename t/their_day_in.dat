As <b>their</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> court approaches, the state forces Punky to stay at Fenster Hall, a shelter for orphaned and abandoned children, which makes her realize how close she has grown to Henry. Finally, their day arrives, and the court approves Henry to become Punky's foster father. Later on, Henry legally adopts her.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, though, the Wealden ironmasters enjoyed <b>their</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the sun, {{perhaps no}} more than Parson Levett whose career was thrust upon him by circumstance.

At his death nearly 20 years later, Reverend William Levett's will shows that he fared even better.

25|$|Slade {{returned}} to the UK in August 1976 to face the UK music business much changed from when they had left. Punk rock had now exploded and had become the dominant influence on youth culture and the music press.

Regardless, Slade were determined that they were now a better live act than ever and refused to call it a day. The band began recording their seventh studio album in August. According to the Slade Fan Club, the band hoped to record a total of 16 tracks and pick the best to release on the album.|$|E

25|$|Experiences in {{this play}} echo a lawsuit (Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)), to which the playwright Lorraine Hansberry's family was a party when they fought to have <b>their</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> court because a {{previous}} class action about racially motivated restrictive covenants (Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519 (1934)) had been similar to their situation. This case was heard prior {{to the passage of}} the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), which prohibited discrimination in housing and created the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Hansberrys won their right to be heard as a matter of due process of law in relation to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the Hansberry defendants were not bound by the Burke decision because the class of defendants in the respective cases had conflicting goals, and thus could not be considered to be the same class.|$|E

2500|$|LRE {{monitoring}} In 2009, Bermudian Springs School District {{was identified}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-2009. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed {{in one of three}} categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. Bermudian Springs School District was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring {{is a product of the}} PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district was assigned to the Tier 3 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of <b>their</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> a regular education classroom.

2500|$|English {{folk songs}} from the late medieval and early modern period reflect the social upheavals of <b>their</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1944 the Marxist scholar A. L. Lloyd claimed that [...] "The Cutty Wren" [...] song {{constituted}} a coded anthem against feudal oppression and actually dated back to the English peasants' revolt of 1381, making it the oldest extant European protest song. He offered no evidence for his assertion, however and {{no trace of the}} song has been found before the 18th century. Despite Lloyd's dubious claim about its origins, however, the [...] "Cutty Wren" [...] was revived and used as a protest song in the 1950s folk revival, an example of the importance of context in determining what may be considered a protest song. In contrast, the rhyme, [...] "When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?", is attested as authentically originating in the 1381 Peasant Revolt, though no tune associated with it has survived. Ballads celebrating social bandits like Robin Hood, from the 14th century onwards, can be seen as expressions of a desire for social justice, though although social criticism is implied and there is no overt questioning of the status quo.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the custom}} for the High-Priest, seven {{days before the}} fast of the seventh month, to {{continue}} constantly in the Temple, and study {{the book of the}} Law, that he might be perfect in it against the day of expiation; wherein the service, which was various and intricate, was wholly to be performed by himself; part of which service was reading the Law to the people: and to promote his studying it, there were certain Priests appointed by the Sanhedrim to be with him those seven days in one of his chambers in the Temple, and there to discourse with him about the Law, and read it to him, and put him in mind of reading and studying it himself. This his opening and reading the Law those seven days, is alluded unto in the Lamb's opening the seals.
