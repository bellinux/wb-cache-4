25|$|When {{performance}} appraisal measures are run down, they typically {{need to be}} replaced by new measures. In the sciences, overlapping data is useful, in that it they can be used to confirm or disprove a given hypothesis. In management, however, overlapping measurements are considered redundant, rather than a useful indication of reliability. By the same token, new measures that lie in direct opposition to existing measures of performance are not helpful. For instance, if a retail company uses units of shoes sold in a month as a metric, adding units of shoes remaining unsold after a month as a new metric is not helpful. Since the company can derive the same information and draw the same conclusions from both metrics, it is more efficient to use only one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>measures.</b> In the interest of generating useful data, new performance measures should be orthogonal to existing metrics.|$|E

2500|$|Happiness in {{its broad}} sense is the label {{for a family}} of {{pleasant}} emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and triumph. For example, happiness comes from [...] "encountering unexpected positive events", [...] "seeing a significant other", and [...] "basking in the acceptance and praise of others". More narrowly, it refers to experiential and evaluative well-being. Experiential well-being, or [...] "objective happiness", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as [...] "How good or bad is your experience now?". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as [...] "How good was your vacation?" [...] and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{following}} session, the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by John W. Taylor of New York, allowing Missouri into the union {{as a slave}} state. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama, a slave state, making the number of slave and free states [...] equal. In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit Maine as a free state. The Senate decided to connect <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>measures.</b> It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, excluding slavery from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36°30′ north (the southern boundary of Missouri), except {{within the limits of}} the proposed state of Missouri. The House then approved the bill as amended by the Senate. The legislation passed, which became known as the Missouri Compromise, won the support of Monroe and both houses of Congress, and compromise temporarily settled the issue of slavery in the territories.|$|E
2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the terms of a contract, but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it looked like it was [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams Mr Williams sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged log-book) said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a contract term a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>measures</b> coincide.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: I use an {{experiment}} {{to examine how}} accurate versus inaccurate relative incentive weights on multiple measures that lead bottom-line financial results (i. e., lead measures) affects managerial performance. The experiment has three types of incentive contracts which reward different combinations of performance measures: only a lag financial <b>measure</b> (ONLYLAG), <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> and a lag financial measure (LEADLAG), or only <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> (ONLYLEAD). I find that adding lead measures to an incentive contract with only a lag measure (LEADLAG versus ONLYLAG) increases performance when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have accurate relative weights, but does not decrease nor increase performance when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have inaccurate relative weights. Hence, the addition of lead measures at best benefits performance when the relative weights on lead measures are accurate, and at worst does not harm performance when the relative weights on lead measures are inaccurate. I also find that removing the lag measure from the incentive contract (ONLYLEAD versus LEADLAG) increases performance when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have accurate relative weights, but decreases performance when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lead <b>measures</b> have inaccurate relative weights.
