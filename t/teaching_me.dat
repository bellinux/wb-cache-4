[...] He also attributes his mother's idols – Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles – to shaping his musical style, calling them [...] "a huge part of my upbringing". Levine attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates. He carried his musical interests to high school, where he states he was [...] "a little rebellious.

2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, <b>teaching</b> <b>me</b> how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

Budig immediately accepted the commitment of being a contract player, saying that she was [...] "very happy" [...] at All My Children. [...] "I don't {{even know how to}} describe it; it's just been a really nice experience for me. I'm friendly with everyone," [...] she stated. [...] "I have to tell you, I am in love with Judy Blye Wilson and Jean Dadario Burke [...] Jean is like my mother, and Judy is like my best friend. It's been really nice to be around people like that." [...] Budig additionally noted her favoritism for Jennifer Bassey (Marian). [...] "She's taken me under her wing a little bit. She's <b>teaching</b> <b>me</b> all sorts of things. I just look at the people on the show and I'm so amazed. There are so many people to learn from there," [...] stated Budig.|$|E
2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in <b>teaching</b> <b>me</b> some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher John Stuart Mill liked Wordsworth's ode {{and found}} it {{influential}} {{to the formation of}} his own thoughts. In his Autobiography (1873), he credited Wordsworth's poetry as being able to relieve his mind and overcome a sense of apathy towards life. Of the poems, he particularly emphasised both Wordsworth's 1815 collection of poetry and the Ode: Intimations of Immortality as providing the most help to him, and he specifically said of the ode: [...] "I found that he too had had similar experience to mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, {{and found it}}, {{in the way in which}} he was now <b>teaching</b> <b>me</b> to find it. The result was that I gradually, but completely, emerged from my habitual depression, and was never again subject to it." [...] David Mason followed Mill in an 1875 essay on literature, including Wordsworth's poetry. After quoting from the ode, Mason claimed of the poem: [...] "These, and hundreds of other passages that might be quoted, show that Wordsworth possessed, in a very high degree indeed, the true primary quality of the poet—imagination; a surcharge of personality or vital spirit, perpetually overflowing among the objects of the otherwise conditioned universe, and refashioning them according to its pleasure." ...|$|E
