5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Soma meets Arikado, who is {{initially}} angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma {{a letter and}} a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma {{to come to the}} castle's center.|$|E

25|$|If {{a single}} photon is emitted into the entry port of the {{apparatus}} at the lower-left corner, it immediately encounters a beam-splitter. Because {{of the equal}} probabilities for transmission or reflection the photon will either continue straight ahead, be reflected by the mirror at the lower-right corner, and be detected by the detector {{at the top of}} the apparatus, or it will be reflected by the beam-splitter, strike <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> the upper-left corner, and emerge into the detector at the right edge of the apparatus. Observing that photons show up in equal numbers at the two detectors, experimenters generally say that each photon has behaved as a particle from the time of its emission to the time of its detection, has traveled by either one path or the other, and further affirm that its wave nature has not been exhibited.|$|E
25|$|On 20 March 2017 the Mirror {{painted the}} {{traditional}} Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is “wall-to-wall” (‘’, Ru) which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly represented by <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> {{the pictures and}} text, labeled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The Mirror article was titled “Russia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup.”, and received negative receptions from Russian media and was also labeled as Fake news. The organizers of the traditional Russian folk festival event are looking to sue the Daily Mirror, it is reported later. Representatives of Daily Mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continues {{to insist that the}} photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gives no evidence of their participation in the festival.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>In</b> 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E

In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the {{telescope}} had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential {{solutions to the problem}} that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, {{to be added to the}} telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as [...] "spectacles" [...] to correct the spherical aberration.|$|E

Two months later, Strange has a conversation with Arabella, who is still living in Padua, explaining that he and Norrell are working to undo the eternal darkness they are both trapped in, but are planning to adventure into other worlds. Neither wish to take her to Faerie again, so he instead promises to return to her when he dis-spells the darkness and tells her not to be a widow till then, which she agrees to.|$|E
500|$|For {{the most}} part, critics responded {{extremely}} positively to [...] "The Devil of Christmas"; it was awarded {{five out of}} five stars by Adam White of The Telegraph, {{four out of five}} stars by James Jackson of The Times, and selected as [...] "pick of the day" [...] by Gerard Gilbert of i. It was praised as a fitting start to the series and as an entertaining Christmas special in its own right. Critics described it as [...] "sublime" [...] and [...] "a treat"; it came [...] "highly recommended" [...] from the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, and the writer Matt Baylis summarised it as [...] "horridly clever, wickedly good". Ian Hyland, writing for <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> 2017, called it the most memorable television over the Christmas period. For him, the episode was almost as strong as [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", in his view the best episode of Inside No. 9. Other critics did not place it has highly in comparison; Frances Taylor, writing for RadioTimes.com, listed [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] as the seventh best of the first 13 episodes, while it did not appear in Dessau's top eight of the first 18.|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{is notable}} for its lesbian character, Theodora. Although the character's {{lesbianism}} is subtly {{mentioned in the}} novel, the film makes it explicit. The film {{is also one of}} the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory. Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator. Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: [...] "I hate you" [...] is written on <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit. According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and {{directed}} by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a clothes line on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes {{to that of a}} luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbs the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting down in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse [...] "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission/Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I'm getting thinner" [...] is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.|$|E
