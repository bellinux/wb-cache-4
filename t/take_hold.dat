5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} initially {{struggled to}} <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> in Wigan with non-league clubs Wigan United (1890s), Wigan County (1897-1900) and Wigan Town (1905-1908) all folding {{within a few}} years of their creation. Wigan Borough, founded in 1919, became the town's first club to play in the Football League when in 1921 they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North. The club left the Football League and folded in 1931. They were replaced a year later by Wigan Athletic, the town's current professional football club.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local {{opposition to a}} perceived bailout of multi-millionaire ownership began to <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b> A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their opposition to a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue began to take shape as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E

5|$|Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E

5|$|An early {{strategic}} plan by Isoroku Yamamoto involved {{the occupation of}} the western Aleutians and Midway Island as a 'decoy' to lure the United States Navy's Pacific fleet away from Pearl Harbor so as to effect the complete destruction of the Hawaiian base before reconstruction efforts could <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b> However, the Aleutians campaign meant that fewer ships could be devoted to the Battle of Midway, a turning point during World War Two. The United States armed forces had broken the Japanese communications code, {{and were able to}} learn of the Japanese plan to attack the Aleutians by May 21, 1942. The Imperial Japanese Navy's plan was to attack and hold Attu and Kiska for future use, while inflicting damage on Dutch Harbor and Adak. Once the United States Navy learned of the plan, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz sent a third of his Pacific Fleet to the Aleutian Islands, under orders to hold Dutch Harbor at all costs.|$|E
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E
5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can <b>take</b> <b>hold.</b> Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up the rig using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on the rig and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before they can take off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain with him on the rig, but Hansen is able to fight him off and kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as the rig explodes below them.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
5|$|The ideas {{advocated}} by several influential reformers {{in the early}} 1900s, such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri, began to <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> at al-Azhar in 1928, with the appointment of Mustafa al-Maraghi as rector. A follower of Abduh, {{the majority of the}} ulema opposed his appointment. Al-Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school, expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects. Fuad disliked al-Maraghi, and had him replaced after one year by al-Zawahiri, but al-Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935, serving until his death in 1945. Under his leadership, al-Azhar's curriculum was expanded to include non-Arabic languages and modern sciences. Al-Zawahiri, who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s, continued the efforts to modernize and reform al-Azhar. Following al-Maraghi's second term as rector, another student of Abduh was appointed rector.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Plovdiv did {{not seem}} to have had a {{profound}} effect on Ivan's career, and he remained a royal favourite. In 1328, Ivan was tasked by Tsar Michael Shishman with the defence of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the residence of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. Andronikos II, facing imminent defeat at the hands of his grandson and co-emperor Andronikos III in a protracted civil war, was distrustful of his own guard, and had requested the assistance of Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor sent Ivan the Russian along with 3,000 horsemen to Constantinople in aid. In the words of Byzantine historian Nikephoros Gregoras, the actual intentions of Michael Shishman were to use Ivan and his men as a Trojan Horse. In a suitable moment, the Bulgarian guard would arrest the emperor and <b>take</b> <b>hold</b> of the palace before allowing Michael Shishman with a large army and Tatar mercenaries into Constantinople.|$|E
