5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E
25|$|The Domestic Violence Enforcement Unit (DOVE) began {{operating}} at the Columbia Police Department on February 2, 1998. The DOVE Unit was formed and funded through the STOP Violence Against Women Grant {{and is a}} specialized unit composed of three investigators, a victim advocate, and two assistant prosecuting attorneys. The unit is composed of detectives from the Columbia Police Department and the Boone County Sheriff's Department. The unit's mission is to decrease the level of domestic violence by investigating domestic violence cases, promoting deterrence of violence, assisting victims, and interrupting <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken. <b>The</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on Mindanao.|$|E

25|$|After {{ten years}} of {{wandering}} and struggles, Rama arrives at Panchavati, {{on the banks of}} river Godavari. This region had numerous demons (rakshasha). One day, a demoness called Shurpanakha saw Rama, became enamored of him, and tried to seduce him. Rama refused her. Shurpanakha retaliated by threatening Sita. Lakshmana, the younger brother protective of his family, in turn retaliated by cutting off the nose and ears of Shurpanakha. <b>The</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> escalated, ultimately reaching demon king Ravana, who was the brother of Shurpanakha. Ravana comes to Panchavati to take revenge on behalf of his family, sees Sita, gets attracted, and kidnaps Sita to his kingdom of Lanka (believed to be modern Sri Lanka).|$|E
25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by anomie, violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from victimhood to criminality embodies <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for the threat of violence ever-present in their world.|$|E
500|$|The band {{have said}} the lyrics refer {{to the events of}} both Bloody Sunday in 1972 and Bloody Sunday in 1920, but are not {{specifically}} about either event. The song takes the standpoint of someone horrified by <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in the province. Bono rewrote the Edge's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with Easter Sunday, but he has said that the band were too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that [...] "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength." ...|$|E

Before giving The Groom the knife, she {{discusses}} <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and her trepidation. The Groom leaves after hugging his mother goodbye.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} themes {{which can be}} {{associated}} with Kurosawa's filmmaking technique which recur from his early films to the films he made {{at the end of his}} career. These include his interest in (a) the master-disciple relationship, (b) the heroic champion, (c) the close examination of nature and human nature, and (d) <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Regarding Kurosawa's reflections on <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> these found a beginning with Throne of Blood (1957), and became nearly an obsession with historical <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> inexorable savage violence—what Stephen Prince calls [...] "the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema" [...] which Kurosawa would sustain as a thematic interest even toward the end of his career in his last films.|$|R

500|$|Others are {{somewhat}} less negative—Brysk, after {{noting that the}} work of the missionaries opened the area to outside intervention and led to the deterioration of the culture, says that the SIL also informed the Huaorani of their legal rights and taught them how to protect their interests from developers. Boster goes even further, suggesting that the [...] "pacification" [...] of the Huaorani was a result of [...] "active effort" [...] by the Huaorani themselves, not the result of missionary imposition. He argues that Christianity served as a way for the Huaorani to escape <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in their community, since it provided a motivation to abstain from killing.|$|E
500|$|Before {{their first}} {{peaceful}} contact with outsiders (cowodi) in 1958, the Huaorani fiercely defended their territory. Viewing all cowodi as cannibalistic predators, they killed rubber tappers {{around the turn}} of the 20th century and Shell Oil Company employees during the 1940s, in addition to any lowland Quechua or other outsiders who encroached on their land. [...] Furthermore, they were prone to internal violence, often engaging in vengeance killing of other Huaorani. Raids were carried out in extreme anger by groups of men who attacked their victims' longhouse by night and then fled. Attempts to build truces through gifts and exchange of spouses became more frequent as their numbers decreased and the tribes fragmented, but <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> continued.|$|E
500|$|UN Women {{believe that}} {{violence}} against women [...] "is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence", and advocate moving from supporting victims to prevention, through addressing root and structural causes. They recommend programmes that start early in life and are directed towards both genders to promote respect and equality, an area often overlooked in public policy. This strategy, which involves broad educational and cultural change, also involves implementing {{the recommendations of the}} 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (2013). To that end the 2014 UN International Day of the Girl Child was dedicated to ending <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> In 2016, the World Health Assembly also adopted a plan of action to combat {{violence against women}}, globally.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said {{that most of}} [...] "Aubrey" [...] was [...] "fun", {{although}} Tillman was not [...] "particularly interesting". He stated that things got [...] "dicey" [...] for him around the revelation about Thibedeaux's child {{and that he did}} not buy Mulder's genetic impulse theories. He criticised the ending, writing that it [...] " [...] whatever mood and character development the previous thirty had spent establishing for cheesy theatrics, and the whole thing lands with a resounding thud. There are too many problems with the concept; the nature/nurture debate {{has been going on for}} decades, and this ep throws the whole thing out the window in about two minutes. No other cause for BJ's actions is ever given... That's some lazy writing right there." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com gave the episode a mixed review and wrote that it was [...] "sort of good [...] sort of a terrible idea". She cited the theme of [...] "breaking the cycle of abuse" [...] as a plus for the entry, noting that it was a [...] "revenge story [...] a woman righting the wrongs of her male ancestors and breaking <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> outside the family". However, Deans was critical of various elements of the episode, most notably, the genetic theory conceit and the idea of a [...] "activator baby" [...] that caused Morrow's past ancestors to work through her.|$|E

500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to see beyond the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E

2500|$|Muslim League leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah proclaimed 16 August 1946 as Direct Action Day, {{with the}} stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, {{the demand for}} a Muslim {{homeland}} in British India, {{which resulted in the}} outbreak of <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> that would be later called the [...] "Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946". The communal violence spread to Bihar (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), to Noakhali in Bengal (where Hindus were targeted by Muslims), in Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces (where Muslims were attacked by Hindus), and on to Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Hindus were attacked or driven out by Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the massacres}} of Timur, {{the people and}} lands within Delhi Sultanate were left {{in a state of}} anarchy, chaos and pestilence. The Sayyid dynasty followed, but few {{historical}} records on religious violence, or anything else for that matter, have been found. Those found, including Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi describe continued religious violence. Over 1414 through 1423, according to the Muslim historian Yahya bin Ahmad, the Islamic commanders [...] "chastised and plundered the infidels" [...] of Ahar, Khur, Kampila, Gwalior, Seori, Chandawar, Etawa, Sirhind, Bail, Katehr and Rahtors. The violence was not one-sided. The Hindus retaliated by forming their own armed groups and attacking forts seized by Muslims. In 1431, Jalandhar for example, was retaken by Hindus and all Muslims inside the fort were placed in prison. Yahya bin Ahmad, the historian remarked on the arrest of Muslims by Hindus, [...] "the unclean ruthless infidels had no respect for the Musulman religion". <b>The</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> between Hindus and Muslims, in numerous parts of India, continued throughout the Sayyid dynasty according to Yahya bin Ahmad.|$|E
