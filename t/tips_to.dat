40|$|PVA (poly-vinyl-alcohol) {{solutions}} in different concentrations and viscosities were prepared and electrospinned to produce nanofibers. SEM images of nanofibers were taken and effect of process parameters (viscosity, voltage and <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> collector distance) were observed. Results showed that increasing viscosity, decreasing <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> collector distance caused thicker nanofiber diameters. Besides, increasing voltage and decreasing <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> collector distance had impact on fiber uniformity causing higher deviations.

5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white <b>tips</b> <b>to</b> the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi is {{a species}} of mud crab that is native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also become {{established}} outside its native range, living in Swansea Docks since 1960, the Mediterranean Sea since the 1970s, the North Sea since 2007 and the Black Sea since 2010. It can reach a carapace width of , and has black <b>tips</b> <b>to</b> its unequal claws. It feeds on bivalves and barnacles, and is in turn eaten by predators including the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Eggs are produced from spring to autumn, the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer, and individuals can live {{for up to two}} years. The closest relative of D.sayi is D.texanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico; the two species differ in subtle features of the genitalia and the last pair of walking legs.|$|E
5|$|The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due {{to their}} soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary {{feathers}} and white <b>tips</b> <b>to</b> the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, {{in which case the}} entire moult may take place in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red <b>tips</b> <b>to</b> the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
