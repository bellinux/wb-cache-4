50|$|It {{should be}} noted that due to the events of the French Revolution, <b>the</b> pre-French Revolution <b>archives</b> kept by <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> Nationales are not just <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> central state, but also <b>the</b> many local <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> Paris region, such as all <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> abbeys {{surrounding}} Paris (e.g. the Basilica of St Denis), <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> churches of Paris, and <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> medieval Paris city hall. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> Nationales serve as <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> French central state for records from 1790 onwards, but for records before 1790 they serve as both <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> of <b>the</b> central state and <b>the</b> local <b>archives</b> of Paris and its region. <b>The</b> <b>Archives</b> Nationales, however, do not keep the church records of Paris (baptisms, marriages and burials). These were entirely destroyed by fires set by extremists {{at the end of the}} Paris Commune in 1871.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Archives</b> of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (Arch Pathol Lab Med) is a core {{clinical}} {{medical journal}} {{published by the}} College of American Pathologists and the American Medical Association. It continues in series publications entitled <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (1926-28), <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> of Pathology (1928-50), <b>the</b> A.M.A. <b>Archives</b> of Pathology (1950-60), and <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> of Pathology (1960-75).|$|R
5000|$|When the {{facility}} opened in 2004 <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> only held a few record series {{but as of}} April 3rd, 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> has preserved 187,121,397 records, of which 65,559,111 were searchable on <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> website. Many of these records were born digital but <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> also preserves digitized historic paper records to provide {{easy access to the}} records to researchers around the world.

5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. <b>The</b> <b>archive</b> preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. <b>The</b> <b>archive</b> also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. <b>The</b> <b>archive</b> also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1952, uranium {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant (now: Silmet). More than 60tonnes of uranium compounds (corresponding to 22.5tonnes of elemental uranium) were produced. Some sources note that uranium produced in Sillamäe {{was used for}} construction of the first Soviet atomic bomb; however, this information is not confirmed by <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|Carson bequeathed her {{manuscripts and}} papers to Yale University, to take {{advantage}} of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to <b>the</b> <b>archive.</b>|$|E

While selections from <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> may be consulted at the Helmerich Center, the George Kaiser Family Foundation has announced a design competition for a major Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa's Arts District.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the film}} was {{released}} by Thanhouser Company Film Preservation on a three-disc DVD set along with eleven other surviving Thanhouser films. The surviving print {{was obtained from the}} British Film Institute and featured a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher. According to Silent Era, <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> holds the 35mm nitrate positive, the more stable 35mm safety negative and a 35mm reference positive.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, {{four million}} {{newspaper}} pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online.

5|$|Natural {{catastrophe}}: Astour says {{a natural}} catastrophe caused the blaze which ended <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> period. He says the destruction {{was limited to}} the area of the royal palace and there is no convincing evidence of looting. He dates the fire to c. 2290 BC (Middle Chronology).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>archive</b> is {{composed}} of three main databases: the Sequence Read Archive, the Trace Archive and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-bank). The ENA is produced and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute {{and is a member}} of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) along with the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank.|$|E
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> {{moved to}} a new {{purpose-built}} building for <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> in Bow Lane in Preston. The official opening, by Lord Clitheroe, was held on 31 October. Two special exhibitions were held at <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> to commemorate this event.|$|R

5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. <b>The</b> <b>archive</b> of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>archives</b> offers {{reference}} {{services to}} individuals wishing to use <b>the</b> <b>archives</b> {{in person or}} from a distance. While genealogists comprise {{nearly half of the}} users of <b>the</b> <b>archives,</b> students, professors, historians, lawyers, journalists, artists and government organizations also utilize the facilities.|$|R

5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> footage.|$|E
5|$|Eyes Without a Face {{received}} its second large theatrical release in a September 1986 re-release {{in conjunction with}} retrospectives at the National Film Theatre in London and at film archive Cinémathèque Française for its 50th anniversary in France. As a founder of Cinémathèque Française, <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> celebrated Franju by presenting the director's back catalogue. The film was re-released in its original form to American theatres on October 31, 2003 under its original running time and title.|$|E
5|$|Instruzione al {{cardinal}} Padrone circa il modo come si deve procurare una fazione di cardinali con tutti i requisiti che deve avere per lo stabilimento della sua grandezza ("Instructions to {{the chief}} cardinal on {{how to create a}} faction of cardinals with all the requisites for the establishment of his grandeur"), discovered in <b>the</b> <b>archive</b> of the Santa Maria de Monserrato offers advice to cardinal-nephews for consolidating power within the College of Cardinals. Another text, the Ricordi dati da Gregorio XV al cardinale Lodovisio suo nipote ("Memoir addressed by Gregory XV to his Nephew Cardinal Lodovisio") offers advice for how to rise within the Curia.|$|E

50|$|For quite a {{long time}} the fonds of <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> were kept in {{separate}} buildings in Vilnius, until <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> moved into a new building situated in 8 Slovackio Street (now 8 Mindaugo Street). However, regular activities of <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> were terminated by the World War II. After the Soviet army occupied Vilnius, during the period of 14-22 October 1939, approximately 14-18 railway vans loaded with archival documents left for Minsk. The damage that <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> suffered was immense as it lost its most valuable and most significant sets of documents including approximately 20 thousand old record books and packages. After Lithuania regained Vilnius, <b>the</b> <b>Archives</b> were transferred {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Education. Juozapas Stakauskas was appointed Head of <b>the</b> <b>Archives.</b>|$|R
