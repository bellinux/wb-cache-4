5|$|Mayor McKune met on July 27 {{with representatives}} of the Brotherhood of <b>Trainmen.</b> Following a meeting of the railway strikers, the firemen and brakemen agreed to return to work at their {{previous}} wages. Shortly thereafter, the mill workers returned to work, with assurances from W. W. Scranton. The miners, however, denounced the concession and resolved to continue the strike.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} crash, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as {{the provincial}} police for British Columbia, began an investigation. The site of the crash was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the RCMP detachment in Prince George, British Columbia, and any charges would be laid there. The CNR suspended all <b>trainmen</b> involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops. The Board of Transport Commissioners announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the switchmen's union called on other {{railroad}} unions {{to engage in a}} general strike in support of their job action. The president of the Switchmen's Mutual Association called the heads of the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Brotherhood of Railway <b>Trainmen</b> to Buffalo for a meeting. But the August 23 conference was brief: The other unions refused to take their members out on strike.|$|E

25|$|During the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, Illinois, in 1893, IC {{was charged}} with {{providing}} commuter service {{for the thousands of}} visitors to the fairground. A call was sent out for <b>trainmen</b> who wanted to work there. Jones answered it, spending a pleasant summer there with his wife. He shuttled many people from Van Buren Street to Jackson Park during the exposition. It was his first experience as an engineer in passenger service and he liked it.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rapid}} growth and {{consolidation}} of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness. Key unions included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Trainmen.</b> Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, and negotiating bureaucratic work rules that favored their membership, such as seniority and grievance procedures.|$|E
25|$|Use of cabooses {{began in}} the 1830s, when railroads housed <b>trainmen</b> in shanties built onto boxcars or flatcars. The caboose {{provided}} the train crew with a shelter {{at the rear of}} the train. The crew could exit the train for switching or to protect the rear of the train when stopped. They also inspected the train for problems such as shifting loads, broken or dragging equipment, and hot boxes (overheated axle bearings, a serious fire and derailment threat). The conductor kept records and handled business from a table or desk in the caboose. For longer trips, the caboose provided minimal living quarters, and was frequently personalized and decorated with pictures and posters.|$|E

25|$|It took {{most of a}} year to get 819's {{situation}} improved. It {{was decided}} to move the engine to a new location approximately 150 yards west of its old spot, near the front of the Reserve building. The Pine Bluff Jaycees spearheaded the drive to build a green and white steel shed at the new location, while the move and reconditioning was being coordinated by members of the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Trainmen</b> and Cotton Belt employees. Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed. That was when BRT stepped in and offered to assist with the engine.|$|E
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for <b>trainmen</b> and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who had {{represented}} the Amalgamated Clothing Workers {{as a lawyer}} in private practice twenty years earlier, and who had received labor's support in running for Mayor of New York, was likewise hostile to any union of city employees {{that could not be}} bent to his will and contemptuous of those that could. Even though the TWU, in coalition with the Amalgamated Association, swept the election to determine which union should represent the IND's employees, the Board refused to bargain with it. La Guardia invited the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Trainmen</b> to represent the motormen, but had to retreat when Roy Wilkins of the NAACP pointed out that this brotherhood did not allow African-American workers to join, while the TWU did. The union's organizing drive on the IND, however, stalled in the face of official opposition.|$|E

25|$|The Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) {{was formed}} August 16–18, 1926, in Washington, D.C. The {{membership}} of the association was the president (or his or her representative) of each member union, and each union received a single vote in the organization's decision-making processes regardless of its size. The president of the Railway Employes' Department, {{a division of the}} American Federation of Labor (AFL; and later the AFL-CIO) was also a member and had a vote. The organization was voluntary, which meant that no member was bound by its decisions. However, members were required to submit (for informational purposes only) any federal legislative proposal which might significantly impact the other RLEA member unions. The organization's first chairman (also sometimes called its president) was David B. Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen. Robertson stepped down to devote more time to his union, and Alexander F. Whitney, President of the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Trainmen,</b> was elected his successor.|$|E
500|$|Wood {{rested his}} case {{on behalf of}} the plaintiff; McNamara offered no {{evidence}} but again moved to dismiss, which Humphrey denied. The judge told the all-male jury that if the LIRR employees [...] "omitted to do the things which prudent and careful <b>trainmen</b> do for the safety of those who are boarding their trains, as well as the safety of those who are standing upon the platform waiting for other trains, and that the failure resulted in the plaintiff's injury, then the defendant would be liable." [...] The jury was out for two hours and 35 minutes, including the lunch hour, and they awarded Palsgraf $6,000 ($ today). Pursuant to statute, she also recovered costs of $142, an amount added to the verdict. A motion for a new trial was denied on May 27, 1927 by Justice Humphrey, who did not issue a written opinion, and a judgment was entered on the verdict on May 31, from which the LIRR appealed on June 14. Once Palsgraf had gotten her jury verdict, the Gerhardts also sued the railroad, with Wood as their counsel.|$|E
500|$|The LIRR's appeal {{took the}} case to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, for the Second Department, the state's {{intermediate}} appeals court. In its briefs before the Appellate Division, the LIRR argued that the verdict had been contrary to the law and the evidence. It stressed that it had no foreknowledge that the package was dangerous, and that no law required it to search the contents of passenger luggage. The brief stated that given this, there was no negligence in helping a man make a train, and even if there was, that negligence was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries. Wood, for Palsgraf, argued that the jury verdict finding negligence was supported by undisputed facts, and should not be questioned by the appellate courts. The plaintiff's brief also suggested that the failure of the railroad to call as witnesses the employees who had aided the man should decide any inferences of negligence against it. Wood deemed the <b>trainmen</b> guilty of a [...] "dereliction of duty", misconduct that was the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries.|$|E

500|$|The LIRR was {{entitled}} {{by law to}} take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) as there had been a dissent in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad argued again that Palsgraf had failed to establish that she had come to harm through the railroad's negligence: that there was no negligence, and even if there was, that neglect had not harmed Palsgraf, since such injury was not [...] "a natural and probable consequence of assisting a man to board a train". Its brief alleged that the <b>trainmen</b> could not have stopped the man from boarding, and once he had flung himself onto the train, {{had little choice but to}} help him, [...] "faced with such an emergency they cannot be charged with negligence because they elected to assist the man rather than stand idly by and leave him to his fate." [...] Wood, for his part, argued that negligence had been found by the jury, and by both majority and dissenting justices in the Appellate Division. He wrote that there were many facts from which the jury could have found negligence, including the fact that the train had not shut its doors as it departed (though whether this was to allow latecomers to board or because it was a summer day is uncertain). The case was argued before the Court of Appeals in Albany on February 24, 1928.|$|E
