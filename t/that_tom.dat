5|$|An unproduced {{script to}} Star Trek Voyager {{was to have}} had a {{flashback}} and revealed <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Paris and Ro had attended Starfleet Academy together.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Hiddleston {{will play the}} role for a three-week run at Vanbrugh Theatre, opening September 1, 2017 and directed by Kenneth Branagh.|$|E
5|$|Following the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack in December 2014, Sony emails were leaked which {{revealed}} casting demands as {{cause of delay}} in the film's production. Also revealed in the emails were the details <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Cruise, Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron were at one point met with to discuss potential roles in the film.|$|E
60|$|Josiah Crabtree's tones were so harsh <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> heart rebelled on the moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{that you}} say?" [...] exclaimed Bawcombe. [...] "Be you saying <b>that</b> Tory's old <b>Tom's</b> son? I'd never {{have taken him}} if I'd known <b>that.</b> <b>Tom's</b> not pure-bred--he's got retriever's blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>that's</b> <b>Tom</b> Tootle,' Miss Abbey made proclamation, in {{her most}} {{commanding}} tones, 'let him instantly come underneath here.' ...|$|R
5|$|In February 2009 {{the company}} {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Morris, at that time an associate director at the Royal National Theatre and formerly artistic director at Battersea Arts Centre, had been appointed as artistic director. Emma Stenning, who had previously worked with Tom Morris at BAC, became executive director.|$|E
5|$|Prydie is also Wales' {{youngest}} try-scorer, scored against South Africa in June 2010, overtaking {{the record}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Pearson set on his debut in 1891. Winger George North, aged 18 years 214 days, overtook Pearson's record {{as the youngest}} Wales player to score a try on debut in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} met again on January 20, 2013, in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28–13. The Patriots led at halftime, 13–7, but the Ravens defense gave up no {{points in the}} 2nd half. It {{was the first time}} ever <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.|$|E
6000|$|... “They’re getting keen, but I {{must say}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom’s</b> not often mistaken in {{business}} matters. He {{seems to think}} your prospects are good.” ...|$|R
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> blood was surging wildly. A miss-- {{and the game}} would either become a tie or be won by Roxley.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall teach {{this young}} upstart a lesson," [...] fumed Josiah Crabtree. He saw <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> coming had greatly lessened his {{influence}} over the lady.|$|R
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
60|$|She was so very earnest on the subject, <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> sister (being as kind as Tom himself) {{could not}} help saying {{something}} to her in reply.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> heart beat rapidly {{as he stepped}} into view and slouched toward the wagon shed. The men started in surprise when they beheld him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{something}} like news," [...] said Queen Bee; [...] "I thought {{it would only be}} that the puppies could see, or <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> tooth was through. Grandpapa has not heard it?" ...|$|R
5|$|As Juliet anesthetizes Ben and Jack {{begins the}} operation, Pickett goes {{with another man}} to Sawyer's cage. Kate and Sawyer attempt to fight, but Pickett's {{companion}} overpowers Kate and holds her at gunpoint, leading Sawyer to surrender. Meanwhile, Jack sabotages the operation by cutting Ben's kidney sack, and demands <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> (M.C. Gainey) let him speak with Kate. Before Pickett can shoot Sawyer, Tom calls over the walkie-talkie. As Pickett gives the walkie to Kate, Jack tells her she has an hour's head start, and directs her to call him on the radio when she is safe.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|However, Judge Langlois {{receives}} a letter informing {{him of the}} genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.|$|E
50|$|It is said <b>that</b> <b>Toms</b> even {{influenced}} {{the way a}} Malayali read a magazine — from back to front— thanks to his strip {{which appeared in the}} back pages of the Malayala Manorama weekly.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, Gregory {{acknowledges}} Tom's {{training is}} complete and brands {{his hand as}} a new Falcon knight. Alice appears, but accepts <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> commitment to his new vocation means they cannot be together at the present. She promises <b>Tom</b> <b>that</b> they'll meet again, before disappearing. Gregory departs for an unknown destination, leaving Tom with Tusk as the town bells ring, calling for the new Spook's services.|$|R
50|$|Both of Bill's rebuttals are {{arguments}} from fallacy. Ginger {{may or may}} not be a cat, and Tom {{may or may not}} be English. The fact <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> argument was fallacious is not, in itself, sufficient proof that his conclusion is false.|$|R
5|$|On May 5, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Peter Dinklage had been signed on to star as Tyrion Lannister in the pilot, and <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> McCarthy was set to direct. On July 19, 2009, a number of further casting decisions were announced, including Sean Bean being given the role of Ned Stark. Other actors signed on for the pilot were Kit Harington in the role of Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon.|$|E
5|$|Rex {{learns that}} he will have to undergo surgery {{following}} his heart attack. Before the operation, Rex's doctor suggests that Bree may have been poisoning him, citing their marital issues as a possible motive. Rex writes a note informing Bree that he understands and forgives her and dies soon after. During Carlos's trial, John informs Carlos that he had been having an affair with Gabrielle, sending Carlos into a violent outburst in the courthouse. Elsewhere, Lynette learns <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> has quit his job as a result of Lynette's betrayal. He then decides that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
50|$|Sam had to {{deal with}} his own {{homophobia}} when he discovered <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> replacement Jamie Forrest (Karl Urban) was gay. Sam eventually realized the error of his ways when Jamie was electrocuted and after saving Jamie's life, Sam and Jamie became friends.|$|R
6000|$|At Castlereagh Street {{he turned}} to the left, and three blocks along came to the Gayety. A crowd of young larrikins hanging outside the door made respectful way for him, and he heard one say to another: [...] "That's 'im! <b>That's</b> <b>Tom</b> King!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a spectacle!" [...] and Tom {{looked as}} if he would have enjoyed seeing it, but Fanny's face grew so forbidding, <b>that</b> <b>Tom's</b> little dog, who was {{approaching}} to welcome her, put his tail between his legs and fled under the table.|$|R
5|$|Things {{apparently}} get better: {{the flat}} is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers {{the door to}} Stevie, who asks Tom {{to come back to}} work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.|$|E
5|$|Tom awakes {{the next}} morning on his sofa. Gerri is alarmed to see him there, as he should be at work, and then gets angry that Migg was invited in. Migg emerges from the {{bathroom}} as Gerri leaves the house, and encourages Tom to call in sick. It is revealed <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> had promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile and deletes an answerphone message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill).|$|E
5|$|Ubisoft hoped <b>that</b> <b>Tom</b> Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist {{would sell}} {{at least five}} million copies. The game debuted at number two on the UK retail {{software}} sales chart in its first week of release, behind Saints Row IV. It was August's fourth-bestselling game in the United States. On October 16, 2013 Ubisoft announced that Blacklist had failed to meet sales expectations, and on November 13 {{it was announced that}} the game had sold two million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|He {{dedicated}} {{the book}} {{to the memory of}} H.S. Toms, the former Curator of Brighton Museum and a one-time assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers; in his dedication, Merrifield noted <b>that</b> <b>Toms</b> had been his [...] "first mentor in archaeology and folk studies".|$|R
50|$|And <b>that's</b> how <b>Tom</b> Dooley met his Waterloo.|$|R
500|$|... "Firs': I ain't yo' son... Second: fuck <b>that</b> Unca <b>Tom</b> bul'shit." ...|$|R
