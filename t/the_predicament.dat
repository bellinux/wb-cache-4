While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E
5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>predicament</b> of a stained woman.|$|E
5|$|Tom Dollery {{was called}} into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on {{difficult}} pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared <b>the</b> <b>predicament</b> of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected {{in place of a}} specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.|$|E

25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to <b>the</b> <b>predicament</b> of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E

25|$|Nagai {{and another}} playwright, Hisashi Inoue, have {{similarities}} in their approaches because they both aim {{to write about}} ordinary people going through extraordinary situations. Both playwrights also write differently compared to other playwrights in their own generation — such as Toshiki Okada and Oriza Hirata. The clear and logical structure of Nagai's plays makes it naturalistic The characters are caught in some predicament and the motor for the play's theatricality is how the characters are liberated from <b>the</b> <b>predicament.</b> Nagai's plays are easily accessible to Western audiences because her works are both traditionally Japanese while also being very universal at the same time. Another playwright, Yōji Sakate, also resembles Nagai because the motivation behind his dramas is his social conscience. Sakate and Nagai both combine elements of Shingeki and Angura.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry skirmishing between Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson's Union cavalry and Forrest's Confederate troopers {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day as the Confederates advanced.

25|$|The Poles {{were still}} at a {{disadvantage}} facing the Swedish army in the open field, and Czarniecki's forces were defeated at the Battle of Gołąb in February 1656. Afterwards the Polish commander successfully applied guerrilla fighting tactics, harassing the enemy while avoiding engagements with the main army. Charles Gustav was soon forced to abandon the siege of Zamość and the planned attack on Lwów. His attempt to hold off the enemy {{along the line of}} the San River was unsuccessful, as his forces were trapped by Czarniecki, Jerzy Lubomirski and Sapieha at the fork formed by the San with the Vistula. When Czarniecki left the site to face and crush at Warka the approaching Swedish rescue force under Margrave Friedrich of Baden, Charles Gustav was able to escape <b>the</b> <b>predicament,</b> but the massive Polish uprising by then seized the initiative and broke the Swedish defenses. Most of Lesser Poland was liberated, except for Kraków, and Greater Poland was also cleared of the Swedes following Czarniecki's and Lubomirski's raid there.

When the warlord of Bing Province, Zhang Yang, vacillated on <b>the</b> <b>predicament</b> upon choosing Cao Cao or Yuan Shao as his ally, his subordinate Yang Chou (楊醜) murdered him and took his head to Cao Cao. However, Sui Gu (眭固), a former Heishan bandit, killed Yang Chou when {{he was on his way}} to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). In order to merge Zhang Yang's remnants, Yue Jin intercepted Sui Gu when the latter attempted to go back north, and successfully hunted down his prey and took control of the Bing Province troops. He then brought his troops to join Cao Cao's eastern campaign against Liu Bei, who had just killed Che Zhou (車冑), the Governor of Xu Province, and taken control of the province. Within a very short time, Liu Bei was defeated, and his aide, Guan Yu, was captured alive. Yue Jin was promoted to Colonel Who Attacks Bandits (討寇校尉) for his achievements.|$|E

25|$|Education writer Richard Wright {{considers}} that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has {{on both sides}} of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not {{made on the basis of}} chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to <b>the</b> <b>predicament.</b>|$|E

25|$|As rivalries {{continued}} to exist between military and civil authorities, the military intelligence service did not completely fall under the sway of the Sûreté, but it was strongly influenced by the institutionalised cooperation and the Sûreté's style of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial politics: it also benefited from an improved flow of information between the two intelligence agencies. Whether the institutionalised sharing of intelligence and enhanced understanding of anti-colonial organisations would lead to more effective prevention, depended largely on the internal operations of the military intelligence service. The mutiny had exposed flaws in the local and central SRM, the result of both personal and institutional deficiencies. Commandant Le Tacon, who had been responsible for organising the local SRM, {{had been unable to}} understand the graveness of <b>the</b> <b>predicament</b> despite several warnings. The central SRM may have prevented the mutiny if the officer responsible for Yen Bai, Slouchez, had informed his local contact, Tran Uc Sinh, about his leave of absence or if he had taken the required precautions of arranging cover during his absence. These oversights were particular to Yen Bai, whereas planned VNQDD mutinies in many other garrisons, such as Kien An, Phu Lang Thuong, Nam Dinh and Sept-Pagodes, were prevented at the last moment. The intelligence failure at Yen Bai did not reflect weaknesses in the overall organisational hierarchy of the SRM, or failures in the decentralisation measures which had started in early 1929 but which had not yet been finished.|$|E

40|$|The Zainichi {{community}} in Japan faced numerous difficulties in Japan {{due to their}} Korean ethnicity. However, the experience of Zainichi women is distinct from Zainichi men because of their subordinate position in a patriarchal social structure in their {{community as well as}} within Japan. The patriarchal structure in the Zainichi community is the main cause of <b>the</b> <b>predicaments</b> of Zainichi women, such as domestic violence and restrained self-determination. Further, melodrama is an appropriate genre to portray and create awareness on <b>the</b> <b>predicaments</b> of Zainichi women, as its element of tragedy focuses on human suffering to evoke pathos, an emotion of sadness, which is melodrama’s aim. By representing the social problems of Zainichi women, melodrama connects the domestic issues of Zainichi women with the larger social structure of patriarchy and sexism in the Zainichi community. However, melodrama film recreates situations where women are suffering and portrayed as victims, which contributes to their negative stereotypes. Moreover, melodrama’s constant focus on human suffering to emphasize the represented social problems reinforces the cause of the problems rather than criticize it. This thesis therefore aims to analyze the representation of women in film and the political role of melodrama in the representation of <b>the</b> <b>predicaments</b> Zainichi women in the Zainichi film Blood and Bones (2004). Furthermore, this thesis argues that melodrama’s element of tragedy in melodrama fails to criticize the subordinate position of women in the Zainichi community...|$|R
