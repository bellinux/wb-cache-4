50|$|Each {{model was}} {{mounted on a}} wheeled chassis, which were then pulled through the water using <b>transparent</b> <b>string.</b> Remote control devices were {{initially}} tested in operating the machines, but the tugboats became too heavy and unable {{to move through the}} water. Remote controls were instead used to power other devices, such as the moving eye features of the models and some cranes.|$|E
50|$|The first {{movement}} is cold, quiet, and somewhat menacing, with <b>transparent</b> <b>strings</b> and distant though ominous timpani motifs. This is underscored with brass calls, also as though {{from a great}} distance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} fact that some English phrases may be used with either the {{definite}} or the indefinite article, without any obvious change in meaning or effect. Whereas many types of phrasal variation have been documented in the literature, there is little description of this particular phenomenon. Examples are given of a number of phrasal types, ranging from opaque idiomatic expressions to fairly <b>transparent</b> word <b>strings.</b> Contextualized examples are provided, mainly from the British National Corpus but also from corpus-based reference works...|$|R
50|$|Baltal {{is unique}} in that the puppets used are {{manipulated}} with the feet, rather than the hands. The puppeteer lies {{on his back in}} a small curtained enclosure, with the puppet's head mounted on his feet. The puppet's arms are manipulated either by strings or by bamboo poles. Allegedly, baltal is said to have derived from the Korean namsadang puppet shows of itinerant traveling players which were located around Anseong. Initially, baltal were performed with a scarecrow-like head mask being put on the foot with the arms being moved by strings which are attached to the puppet’s hands. The tradition of bamboo pole system for hand movements was probably developed by the Korean puppeteers Nam Hyongwoo or Lee Dong-an who would attach bamboo poles to the puppet’s hands and control the poles with <b>transparent</b> <b>strings</b> which come over the backdrop and are controlled by the puppeteer from behind the screen.Baltal normally involved character based plays and folk stories. The puppeteer and the puppet characters often interact with the musicians, an actor (often a woman dressed in yellow jacket) or a narrator (who is often dressed in grey trousers and uses a fan). Often the story and dialogue is interspersed with songs, character dances, dialogue, songs and satirical jokes. The performance generally revolves around witticisms and clever dialogue, as well as songs, and the puppet interacts with the narrator and other performers. Musical accompaniment is provided by traditional instruments such as the piri, haegeum and janggu.|$|R
50|$|The capillitium is {{composed}} of a few rotund chalk knots, which are linked through <b>transparent</b> to yellowish <b>strings</b> with acanthoid, non-overgrown humps. The capillitium becomes segmented through white to yellowish, partly perforated limestone plates, which are overgrown {{on the edge of}} the peridium. The spores are 8 to 10, rarely 7 to 11 µm and their body is black-brown, in transmitted light purple-brown, on the surface dense and fine-warty.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the finite-time stabilization of a tree-shaped network of <b>strings.</b> <b>Transparent</b> boundary conditions are applied {{at all the}} external nodes. At any internal node, {{in addition to the}} usual continuity conditions, a modified Kirchhoff law incorporating a damping term α u_t with a coefficient α that may depend on the node is considered. We show that for a convenient choice of the sequence of coefficients α, any solution of the wave equation on the network becomes constant after a finite time. The condition on the coefficients proves to be sharp at least for a star-shaped tree. Similar results are derived when we replace the transparent boundary condition by the Dirichlet (resp. Neumann) boundary condition at one external node...|$|R
40|$|We discuss Tannaka {{reconstruction}} {{in general}} categories, not necessarily vector spaces. For an excellent introduction, see [4]. Before that, though, {{an introduction to}} my notation for monoidal and comonoidal functors. The original notion for graphically depicting monoidal functors as <b>transparent</b> boxes in <b>string</b> diagrams is due to Cockett and Seely[1], and has recently been revived and popularized by Mellies[5] with prettier graphics and an excellent pair of example calculations which nicely show the worth of the notation. However, a small modification improves the notation considerably. For a monoidal functor F: A − → B, we have a pair of maps, Fx ⊗ Fy − → F (x ⊗ y) and e − → Fe, which we notate as follows: Similarly, for a comonoidal F, we have maps F (x ⊗ y) − → Fx ⊗ Fy and Fe − → e which we notate in the obvious dual way, as follows: Graphically, the axioms for a monoidal functor are depicted as follows: where, once again, the similar constraints for a comonoidal functor are exactly the above with composition read right-to-left instead of left-to-right. 1 It is curious and pleasing that the two unit axioms bear a superficial resemblence to triangle-identies being applied along the boundary of the “F-region”. The above axioms seem to indicate some sort of “invariance under continuous deformation of F-regions”. For a functor which is both monoidal and comonoidal, pursuing this line of thinking leads one to consider the following pair of axioms: A functor with these properties {{has been called a}} Frobenius monoidal functor by Brian and Craig. Let F: A − → B be a (mere) functor between monoidal categories, where B is assumed to be left closed. Then define EF = a∈...|$|R
