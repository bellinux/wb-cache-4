Ellen directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off. They both proclaim they won't fight each other, but Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes The Kid aside and asks him to withdraw from the contest, telling him his time will come. The Kid refuses and they fight, with The Kid wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>who</b> dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face each other, but both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they will meet at dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{show that}} within the Chicago Public Schools, both the {{introduction}} of NCLB in 2002 {{and the introduction of}} similar district-level reforms in 1996 generated noteworthy increases in reading and math scores among students {{in the middle of the}} achievement distribution but not among the least academically advantaged students. The stringency of proficiency requirements varied among the programs implemented for different grades in different years, and our results suggest that changes in proficiency requirements induce teachers to shift more attention to stu-dents who are near the current proficiency standard.

[...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express. Whether it's the kid who's talking a million miles an hour, but saying nothing or <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> isn't able to get out any word at all they're both at the mercy of not knowing how to express what's inside them." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} criticism, cast members' {{performances}} were usually well received – in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah. Ebert said, [...] "The movie depends on her, and she deserves its trust." [...] Hornaday opined that [...] "Palmer's Akeelah is that cinematic , <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> is cute without being too cute, sympathetic without being cloying, and believable without being tiresome." [...] Evening Chronicle stated Palmer does it [...] "with effortless grace" [...] {{and that she}} [...] "carries the film and doesn't strike a single wrong emotional note." [...] Fuchs felt {{that most of the}} film's strengths [...] "have to do with Palmer's winning performance." [...] Ingman declared Atchison's [...] "ensemble is wonderful, and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah's maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort." [...] Turan complimented how Fishburne and Bassett's [...] "presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity." [...] Mohan stated, [...] "Although Fishburne and Bassett can do these roles in their sleep, the kids are actually quite engaging."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song's in an interview: [...] "That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> offered {{the whole thing up}} to us was a Shins fan." [...] Online message boards (many on Pitchfork.com) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled [...] "McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass" [...] in reaction. The ad's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company's typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song's lyrics, which at times refer to [...] "the dirt in your fries." [...] The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, Chutes Too Narrow (2003). Mercer nevertheless [...] "recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising," [...] remarking, [...] "Imagine us playing [...] "New Slang," [...] and everyone in the audience going, 'That's the song from the McDonald's commercial — I'm loving it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can look at it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president.

2500|$|On March 1, 1879, after {{previous}} {{efforts to}} restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty, Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with <b>the</b> <b>Kid,</b> <b>who</b> had witnessed {{the murder of a}} Lincoln County lawyer named Chapman. Wallace wanted the Kid to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but the Kid had killed others and wanted Wallace's protection from the outlaw gang and amnesty for his crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for the Kid to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds." [...] On March 20, the Kid agreed to testify against others involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for the Kid's arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. After the Kid testified in court on April 14, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. The Kid escaped from jail and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. The Kid was shot and killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{the punk}} style was popular among people aged 18–22. Characterized by multi-colored mohawks, ripped skinny jeans, worn band tee-shirts, and denim or leather jackets. This style was popular {{among people who}} listened to punk music such as The Sex Pistols, and later, (despite the band's self-proclaimed rock'n'roll image) Guns N' Roses. Usually the denim jackets (which became an {{identity}} of the group) were adorned by safety pins, buttons, patches, and several other pieces of music or cultural memorabilia. Oftentimes, fans of the punk style would take random bits of fabric and attach them to their other clothes with safety pins. This soon became a popular way of attaching clothing, {{and it is now}} known as [...] "pin shirts" [...] with young women. The shirts are, essentially, rectangular pieces of fabric that are pinned on one side with safety pins. In the 1980s, a dressed down look (e.g. buzzed hair, T-shirts, jeans and button up shirts) was also very popular with people involved in punk rock, more specifically the hardcore punk scene. The Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris said [...] "Some of those punk rock kids they interviewed were a little over the top, but the thing historically is – the L.A./Hollywood punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we {{had nothing to do with}} that. Black flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>who</b> worked at the gas station or submarine shop." [...] Punk dress was not simply a fashion statement. It epitomized a way of thinking and seeing oneself as an individual cultural producer and consumer. In this way, punk style led many people to ask further questions about their culture and their politics.|$|E

[...] Here a young couple sets off on a Greyhound for San Francisco, only to discover the distractions of the big city dilute love. Peters, who wrote a signature song for country legend Charley Pride ("Kiss an Angel Good Morning"), captures the spunk and sorrow of the adventure—but more interestingly, Martell's performance captures a bit of San Francisco few have seen—the <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> arrived not in beat-up Volkswagens but on <b>the</b> bus; <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> weren't white, <b>who</b> were brown; <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> came not from Eastern cities, but from Southern towns.
