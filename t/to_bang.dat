5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

These five new train sets of rolling stock entered service on 29 November 2013 after the first two stations of the Silom Line extension <b>to</b> <b>Bang</b> Wa opened in January and February 2013, respectively. This second batch of CNR EMUs (B Class) differ slightly from the first batch in exterior fitting out such as with the LCDs screens, LED route displays, signage, and passenger communication units.|$|E

25|$|The third {{extension}} to the network, a 5.3km, four station extension from Wongwian Yai (S8) <b>to</b> <b>Bang</b> Wa (S12) in Phasi Charoen District began {{construction in the}} 2nd quarter of 2011 with a deadline {{of the end of}} 2012. Only the stations had to be constructed as the viaduct had been completed some years prior. However, construction was delayed for many months by the Bangkok floods of late-2011. It eventually opened in stages. Pho Nimit opened on 12 January 2013, Talat Phlu opened on 14 February 2013, with the last two stations opening on 5 December 2013. For most of 2013, passengers changed platforms and trains at Wongwian Yai for a shuttle service to S09 and S10 as there was no turnout at S10 for through trains. Since the opening of the final section of the extension <b>to</b> <b>Bang</b> Wa station on 5 December 2013, this is no longer the case.|$|E
25|$|The phase 1 Eastern section began {{construction}} in June 2017 with a planned October 2022 opening.

When fully completed, the line will be 37.5-km long, mostly underground, with 29 stations (7 elevated stations and other 22 underground stations, including the current Thailand Cultural Centre Station of MRT Blue Line).|$|E

After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> on the wall that separated him from the subject.

25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

500|$|Adams first drummed at an Indians game on August 24, 1973, at Cleveland Stadium, at a game {{in which}} the Indians beat the Texas Rangers, 11–5. Adams, who was 21 years old at the time, has stated that he brought his bass drum to that first game because he wanted to add to the noise of [...] "seat banging", a {{tradition}} at Cleveland Stadium in which fans would bang the swivel seat of their chairs against the chair's base during tense moments in the game. But Adams preferred to sit in the bleachers, where there were no seats <b>to</b> <b>bang.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of [...] "phone tag", Michael impersonates Michael Jackson, Tito Jackson, Mike Tyson, and Saddam Hussein. In addition, several songs are alluded to. Michael sings [...] "I don't want to work/I just want <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> on this mug all day" [...] {{to the tune of}} Bang the Drum All Day by Todd Rundgren. Jim alludes to the Jets, one of the rival street gangs in the musical West Side Story, by quoting the noted lyrics [...] "When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way", as well as {{snapping}} his fingers {{in the same way as}} the gang members. Several popular quotes are misused in the episode: Michael consistently misuses the phrase [...] "Catch-22", and Dwight mistakes the phrase [...] "tit for tat" [...] as [...] "tit for tit".|$|E
500|$|Marge {{finally gets}} {{fed up with}} the {{punishment}} and cuts the tether. Only now, she and Homer get brought back before Judge Harm and have their heads and hands locked up in old-fashioned wooden stocks. Not being able to bare the punishment any longer, they break free and decide to get back at the judge. When the plan goes awry, they accidentally sink the judge's houseboat and are once again brought into court. Just as Judge Harm is ready <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> her gavel, Judge Snyder comes back from his fishing trip and declares a verdict of [...] "Boys will be boys," [...] dismissing the case. While driving home afterwards, Marge makes the entire family promise not to break the law again for a whole year, which Homer instantly breaks when he runs over Hans Moleman.|$|E

50|$|Bang later {{discovers that}} the {{discomfort}} is a failed attempt at mind control by a demon trapped beneath the mountain at Demonhead's northern end. The demon failed <b>to</b> control <b>Bang,</b> but manages <b>to</b> control <b>Bang's</b> ally, Michael. The demon {{sets up a}} plot through Michael <b>to</b> entice <b>Bang</b> with treasure requiring {{the use of a}} Magic Stone. The Magic Stone ends up being the key to freeing the demon from its imprisonment. After <b>Bang</b> fails <b>to</b> defeat the demon, it seeks out and kills Tom Guycot and steals his medallion. Bang learns from the hermit that the demon can only be destroyed with the Sword of Apollo.|$|R

500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E
500|$|The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 {{attracted}} {{a crowd of}} 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3–2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5–2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> {{his head against the}} gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by [...] lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, actor Dwayne Johnson made a brief live-action appearance in the episode, appearing as himself, along with two action figures of Peter and Lois, which he proceeds <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> {{on top of each}} other in order to illustrate a censored sex scene. Commenting on his appearance in the episode, Johnson stated that he was a [...] "big fan" [...] of Family Guy, having quickly befriended show creator Seth MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy. While filming the movie, Johnson had reached out to MacFarlane, saying that he would love to [...] "return the favor" [...] by appearing on Family Guy, which eventually led to his role in this episode. Actress Adrianne Palicki and voice actor Rick Pasqualone also guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge and Ralph Garman, along with writers Steve Callaghan, Mark Hentemann, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin and John Viener, also made minor appearances. Actors Patrick Warburton and Adam West made appearances as well.|$|E

500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff that you want <b>to</b> <b>bang</b> on; rent {{what you want to}} rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where your mind and your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E
500|$|Still legally bound <b>to</b> <b>Bang</b> Records, Morrison would {{yet have}} more issues {{with them in}} the future. For the time being, Schwaid managed to free him from those obligations, under several conditions. First, Morrison had to write and submit to Web IV Music (Bert Berns's {{publishing}} company) three original compositions per month over the course of one year. [...] Morrison fulfilled that obligation by recording thirty-six nonsense songs in a single session. Such action risked legal reprisals, but ultimately none transpired. Morrison then had to assign Web IV one half of the copyright to any musical composition written and recorded by Morrison and released as a single within one year from 12 September 1968. That demand became a moot point when Warner Bros. refrained from releasing any single during that time frame, as no single was released from Astral Weeks. [...] Finally, Morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by Web IV on his next album. Morrison fulfilled that demand with two of his own compositions, [...] "Madame George" [...] and [...] "Beside You", although the versions subsequently released were vastly different musically from the original versions recorded with Bang.|$|E

[...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts".
