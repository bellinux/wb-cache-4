5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded <b>the</b> <b>rifle,</b> {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> when the family was murdered.|$|E

5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through the lines of <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{issue that}} {{has an effect on}} the barrel's hold on the bullet is <b>the</b> <b>rifling.</b> When <b>the</b> bullet is fired, it is forced into <b>the</b> <b>rifling,</b> which cuts or [...] "engraves" [...] the surface of the bullet. If <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> is a {{constant}} twist, then <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> rides in <b>the</b> grooves engraved in the bullet, and everything is secure and sealed. If <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> has a decreasing twist, then the changing angle of <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> in <b>the</b> engraved grooves of the bullet causes <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> to become narrower than the grooves. This allows gas to blow by, and loosens the hold of the bullet on the barrel. An increasing twist, however, will make <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> become wider than the grooves in the bullet, maintaining the seal. When a rifled-barrel blank is selected for a gun, careful measurement of the inevitable variations in manufacture can determine if <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> twist varies, and put the higher-twist end at the muzzle.|$|R

5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rifle</b> had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen <b>the</b> <b>rifle,</b> in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create {{additional}} provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. The men from the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; {{with the exception of a}} single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. <b>The</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war in August 1914, the British regular army was a small professional force. It consisted of 247,432 regular troops organised in four regiments of Guards (Grenadier, with 3 Battalions; Coldstream, with 3 Battalions; Scots, with 2 Battalions; Irish with 1 Battalion), 68 regiments of the line and <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Brigade (despite its name, this was an infantry regiment), 31 cavalry regiments, artillery and other support arms. Most of the line infantry regiments had two regular battalions, one of which served at home and provided drafts and replacements to the other which was stationed overseas, while also being prepared {{to be part of the}} Expeditionary Force - the Royal Fusiliers, Worcestershire Regiment, Middlesex Regiment, King's Royal Rifle Corps and <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) had four regular battalions, two of which served overseas. Almost half of the regular army (74 of the 157 infantry battalions and 12 of the 31 cavalry regiments), was stationed overseas in garrisons throughout the British Empire. The Royal Flying Corps was part of the British Army until 1918. At {{the outbreak}} of the war, it consisted of 84 aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On 24 November 2005 the Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that the regiment would amalgamate with The Light Infantry, the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry to form a single large regiment to be called <b>The</b> <b>Rifles.</b> <b>The</b> reorganisation into <b>The</b> <b>Rifles</b> took effect on 1 February 2007 with the 1st Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming the 2nd Battalion, <b>The</b> <b>Rifles,</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets becoming 4th Battalion, <b>The</b> <b>Rifles</b> and <b>the</b> surviving Territorial Army companies of 4 and 5 Royal Green Jackets, along with a company of the RGBW becoming the 7th Battalion, <b>The</b> <b>Rifles.</b> <b>The</b> 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets' final operation was in Basra, in Iraq, on Operation Telic in 2006/7.|$|R
50|$|This was in {{preparation}} for all four regiments being amalgamated into a single large regiment named <b>The</b> <b>Rifles,</b> which was formed in February 2007. Regimental names of the regiments that formed <b>The</b> <b>Rifles</b> were not maintained. As a consequence, upon the formation of <b>The</b> <b>Rifles,</b> <b>the</b> name Light Division was no longer to be used.|$|R

5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but more powerful than the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E
5000|$|By June 1917, the {{government}} that had agreed {{to the establishment of}} <b>the</b> <b>Rifles</b> fell, and <b>the</b> new prime minister and cabinet would not recognize them. Iranian attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>Rifles</b> changed, and by late 1917 there was intense hostility towards <b>the</b> <b>Rifles</b> and <b>the</b> British. [...] The British even approached the United States with a proposal to take <b>the</b> <b>Rifles</b> over, but <b>the</b> US declined {{due to a lack of}} officers who could speak the language or were knowledgeable about Iran.|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} ballistics, swaging {{describes the}} process of the bullet entering the barrel and being squeezed to conform to <b>the</b> <b>rifling.</b> Most firearm bullets are made slightly larger than the inside diameter of <b>the</b> <b>rifling,</b> so that they are swaged to engage <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> and form a tight seal upon firing. Compare to obturate.|$|R
50|$|In breech-loading firearms, {{the task}} of seating the {{projectile}} into <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> is handled by the throat of the chamber. Next is the freebore, which is {{the portion of the}} throat down which the projectile travels before <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> starts. <b>The</b> last section of the throat is the throat angle, where the throat transitions into <b>the</b> <b>rifled</b> barrel.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
5|$|In February 1884, the Impeachment {{trial of}} Prime Minister Christian Selmer and his entire cabinet was nearing its end.

5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and <b>the</b> <b>rifle</b> fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's electro-mechanical arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} muzzle-loading <b>rifle,</b> with {{a closely}} fitting ball to take <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> grooves, {{was loaded with}} difficulty, particularly when foul, {{and for this reason}} was not generally used for military purposes. Even with <b>the</b> advent of <b>rifling</b> <b>the</b> bullet itself didn't change, but was wrapped in a greased, cloth patch to grip <b>the</b> <b>rifling</b> grooves.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rifle's</b> {{adoption}} {{caused some}} controversy, as despite the weapon's approval by King Carol I, General Budișteanu derided <b>the</b> Austrian <b>rifle</b> as un baston ("a walking stick"), and <b>the</b> <b>rifle's</b> bore, {{smaller than the}} usual Mannlicher product, caused difficulties in finding compatible gunpowder.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Brunswick <b>rifle</b> was one {{of several}} designs {{submitted}} to replace <b>the</b> Baker <b>rifle.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> Baker <b>rifle,</b> <b>the</b> Brunswick <b>rifle</b> used a special round ball with raised ribs that fit into two spiraling grooves in the barrel.|$|R
5|$|Most {{members of}} the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, however, were not chosen for <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps and {{remained}} with the Main Army. The Marylanders in Smith's composite company served with the 11th Virginia Regiment in the 3rd Virginia Brigade at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown, {{as well as at}} the Battle of Monmouth after they were administratively attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment of the 2nd Maryland Brigade at the end of the 1777 campaign season. The Virginians in Long's composite company remained attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment and fought at the same engagements in 1777 and 1778. Lt. (later Capt.) Philip Slaughter was the acting commander of the company during Long's nearly two-year attachment to <b>the</b> <b>Rifle</b> Corps and its permanent commander after Long's resignation.|$|E

5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. <b>The</b> <b>rifle</b> has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews).
