40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 49) Analytical techniques {{developed in}} the field of optimal control theory will be exercised in an examination of constrained <b>flight</b> <b>trajectories</b> for a maneuverable re-entry vehicle. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>trajectories</b> will result from a quadratic tracking performance index subject to specified state constraints and various re-entry boundary conditions. The state constraints will result from the physical limitations of the system such as allowable vehicle attitude, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. The boundary conditions to be analyzed will be: 1) re-entry angle; 2) re-entry velocity; 3) re-entry altitude; or 4) a combination of these conditions. In order to limit the scope of this paper the further constraints of restricting the analysis to the vertical plane and for a stationary target will also be specified. A set of equations for determining the optimal control law subject to the aforementioned constraints will be derived from the vehicle's equations of motion for a finite bandwidth system. From the optimal control law a set of equations describing a sub-optimal control law will be derived. These resultant sub-optimal control law equations, which employ state weighting gain matrices, will then be numerically evaluated in order to determine <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>trajectories</b> and <b>the</b> system state responses for the trajectories. From the numerical solutions the effects of boundary conditions and state weighting gain matrices on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>trajectories</b> and terminal states can be quantified.
