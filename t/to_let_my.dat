5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
25|$|They {{are trying}} to persuade me <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have {{expressed}} sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or {{to take it to}} Himself.|$|E
500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E

2500|$|He {{refused to}} be {{depressed}} by life in India. [...] "I am only an exile," [...] he remarks, [...] "endeavouring to work a successful existence in Dustypore, and not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> environment shape me as a pudding takes the shape of its mould, but to make it tributary to my own happiness." [...] He therefore urged his readers to cultivate a hobby.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was a time}} of {{transition}} between the beat movement and the hippie era, when the Village flourished as a creative mecca. [...] "The Village was a really neat place to be at that time. We went to the theater that was to become the Fillmore East; it wasn't called that yet, but they were starting to have some rock concerts, like Chuck Berry. ... I began <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> hair grow and become a real New York hippie", he recalled.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever Shi Yi {{recommended}} {{talents to}} Sun Quan, he only pointed out {{their strengths and}} said nothing about their weaknesses. Sun Quan thus chided him for not saying anything about their weaknesses and not making judgments about them. In response, Shi Yi said, [...] "Your Majesty, as your subject, my duty is to perform my role well. I am always worried about not being competent in my role. (I keep my opinions about their weaknesses to myself because) I don't want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> ignorance and limited knowledge affect Your Majesty's judgment about them." ...|$|E

He's really {{a part of the}} reason why. He's going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it's important for me to continue <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> generation know how important he was to music." [...] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-n-Pepa, as influences. Her second studio album [...] (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|Ffinden then {{refused to}} speak {{to any of the}} Darwins, and when two evening lectures were {{proposed}} for the village in 1875, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that [...] "I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin's views, but.. I had fully determined.. not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God's grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind." [...] Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that [...] "If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it".|$|E
2500|$|On June 28, 2017 a {{deal was}} {{finalized}} for Ortiz's return bout against Mexican boxer Saul Corral (24-9, 15 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round fight {{to take place}} at the Rabobank Theater in Bakersfield, California on July 30 and would headline a Premier Boxing Champions card. Ortiz made a successful comeback with a fourth round stoppage win over Corral. Ortiz stalked Corral from the opening round landing straight lefts and hooks, although Corral fought back, Ortiz did enough to win the early rounds. In round 3, referee Jack Reiss docked a point of Corral after warning him for holding Ortiz's left arm. In round 4, Ortiz landed a left hand that sent Corral down. He beat the count, but Ortiz pounced, forcing the referee to stop the fight after 1 minute and 26 seconds. Ortiz kept his options open when speaking in the post fight, “There are a lot of names out there in the welterweight division. At this point I’m going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> team guide me, because I’ll always be ready for anybody.” He also praised Corral, “Corral is a great fighter who hits hard and I definitely felt it.Top of the line boxers like myself, we hang in there and we perform {{to the best of our}} abilities. It was my first time back in a while and it’s just the beginning.” ...|$|E
