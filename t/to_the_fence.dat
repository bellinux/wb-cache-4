5|$|The Australian onslaught {{against the}} spinners {{prompted}} Yardley {{to take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment, and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper’s pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> rail and vents was possibly {{caused by a}} heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
25|$|By October 2000, {{the number}} of bras had reached around 200, and again the fence was cleared of bras. This time the story spread even wider, as the fence had become to some a quirky tourist attraction, and media sources from as far afield as Europe became {{interested}} in the fence. Due to this interest, {{the number of}} bras being added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> personally, or sent to be added, increased dramatically. In early 2006, the number of bras attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> stood at close to 800.|$|E

25|$|The 1984–85 {{season is}} also notable for the {{erection}} {{of an electric}} perimeter fence around the pitch at Stamford Bridge, the response of chairman Ken Bates to regular pitch invasions and fights during matches.

25|$|Before the 2015 AFL season {{synthetic}} turf {{was installed}} {{around the perimeter}} of the playing surface. The most controversial sections were around the AFL interchange gates as well as where the goals are located where the synthetic turf comes right up to the playing area (the synthetic turf at the goals was moved several meters closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> in March 2017). This was highlighted after a Brisbane Lions player suffered a season ending ACL injury and one coach labeling the surface 'dangerous' after a game at the venue.|$|E
25|$|The Bra Fence {{began at}} some point between Christmas 1998 and New Year 1999, when four bras were {{attached}} to the wire fence alongside the road. The original reason for the bras being attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> is unknown. News spread of the addition, which was left on the fence by the local landowners, and more bras began to appear. By the end of February there were some 60 bras, but at about this time they were all removed anonymously. This {{was reported in the}} local press, and the story gained widespread dissemination through the New Zealand media, leading to more bras appearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} feather {{board was}} developed in 1990. The patented Grip-Tite is held to a cast iron table top or steel sub fence by high strength permanent magnets. The advantage of a magnetic feather board is the fast setup time on any cast iron tool deck or steel faced fence. When {{used in conjunction with}} a steel faced rip fence, they are used to hold down ripped wood on any saw deck and prevent kickback. Feed wheels added to the Grip-Tite base pull ripped wood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> allowing the operator to rip wood on any table saw with no hands near the blade.|$|E

25|$|In {{the top of}} the sixth, Allen hit a one-out double <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> {{in center}} field. With two outs, Moore doubled to right, driving in Allen and {{narrowing}} Hilldale's lead to one run. In the bottom of the sixth, Hilldale had runners on first and third with one out, and Thomas hit a fly caught by Allen in short right near the foul line. Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in {{the top of the}} seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale.|$|E
25|$|Press {{coverage}} was substantial {{at the time}} of the incident, but died down quickly. This was the first peacetime incident in which USAF aircraft were destroyed by a domestic act, and the first time separatists had attacked a USAF installation on US soil. It was greatest material loss from any single attack perpetrated against the USAF anywhere in the world. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) was aware of the shortfalls in security at Muniz and of the threat, yet corrective actions had not been implemented at the time. The bombings resulted in increases in base security. It was revealed that there were to be 22 personnel, up from 11, guarding the base, funded entirely by the federal government, as well as electric devices added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Still tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> Shepard {{was in a}} coma 18 {{hours after}} the attack when he was {{discovered}} by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow. Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. The medical gloves issued by the Albany County Sheriff's Department were faulty, and Fluty's supply ran out. She decided to use her bare hands to clear an airway in Shepard's bloody mouth. A day later, she was informed that Shepard was HIV positive, and she may have been exposed due to cuts on her hands. After taking an AZT regimen for several months, she tested negative for HIV. Judy Shepard later wrote she learned of her son's HIV status during his stay at the hospital following the attack.|$|E

50|$|Hop {{diffusion}} - is a non-Brownian {{diffusion of}} proteins and lipid molecules within the plasma membrane. Hop diffusion occurs due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discontinuity {{of the cell}} cytoplasmic membrane. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fences</b> and pickets model, plasma membrane is compartmentalized by actin-based membrane-skeleton “fences”, that occur when cytoplasmic domains collide with the actin-based membrane skeleton; and anchored-transmembrane protein “pickets”. Due to these obstacles membrane proteins undergo temporary conﬁnement within 30-700- nm compartments with infrequent intercompartmental hops.|$|R

25|$|The final morning began poorly for Australia with Mohammad Rafique {{picking up}} the wickets of Gilchrist (12) and Warne (5) cheaply to have Australia in trouble at 6-231 still {{requiring}} 76 for victory. However, Ponting remained resolute in defence as he uncharacteristically crawled his way towards a century. He was joined by Lee and together they put on 46 for the 7th wicket. But the new ball turned Bangladesh's fortunes and Lee's wicket in the lead up to lunch gave them some hope. Their biggest opportunity came when Ponting skied a pull shot on 98 only to be dropped by Mashrafe Mortaza at fine leg. He proceeded to his 31st test century in the final over before lunch with a cover drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Now joined by Gillespie, victory was delayed only by the lunch break. Ponting remained not out on 118. Mohammad Rafique finished with match figures of 9-160. Adam Gilchrist was named man of the match.|$|E
25|$|The War Department {{appointed}} Colonel James C. Strong as the {{new head}} of the garrison. His command began during General Orme's command of the camp and continued through Colonel Sweet's command. At the beginning of his duty, Strong had only about 650 healthy men to guard almost 6,000 prisoners. Strong prepared new prison rolls and found that 84 prisoners were missing. He was the first garrison commander to force prisoners to work, but work details were restricted to four hours per day. Between January and March 1864, when Colonel Strong had only 550 men available for guard duty, thirty-two escapes were made from the camp. Strong realized placement of the buildings in Prisoner's Square contributed to the problem and had them moved away from the fences and closer {{to the middle of the}} square. The fence separating Prisoner's Square from the rest of the camp was completed on March 22, 1864. About this time General Orme attached many bright oil–burning lamps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to illuminate the area at night.|$|E
25|$|The limes {{was never}} able to prevent whole Germanic tribes from {{entering}} the territory of the Roman Empire. This was not the intention of the builders. Near the watch towers, the limes was open to passage, especially by traders or persons coming to live or work within the Empire, the purpose of the limes was control of this traffic. To cross the limes it was necessary to pass the towers, and so come to the notice of the garrison, or try to climb or destroy the wall and the stakes. Only individuals or small groups could climb the obstacles without being noticed, and they could not drive much stolen livestock with them. Large groups would be noticed, they could destroy one or several towers, but this also would come {{to the attention of the}} Romans. This knowledge of all traffic crossing the border was crucial to the Roman military. For a territory as large as the Roman Empire, there were amazingly few soldiers, almost all of the legions were based close to the frontiers, any hostile band that managed to pass this outer area of defense could travel within the Empire without much resistance. The purpose of the limes was as an early warning system, deterrence of casual small-scale raiding, and the ability to counteract while the enemy was still near the border fortresses and garrisons. Other researchers believe the limes may have been a bulwark to prevent illegal immigration, comparing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> system along the American-Mexican border.|$|E

30|$|Given {{the trends}} towards sedentarisation and {{management}} restructuring that occurred amongst the region's pastoralists {{in the years}} leading up to, and directly following enclosure in 1996, {{it comes as no}} surprise that on the whole, few pastoralists were opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fences.</b> A survey of 53 households from both the village and surrounding cattleposts posed questions regarding the veterinary work conducted by the DAHP; local understanding of the purpose of the veterinary fences; and local perceptions of the positive or negative impacts of veterinary <b>fence</b> enclosure.

25|$|In 1958-59 the MCC {{had insisted}} on fewer upcountry matches, on this tour they were {{increased}} {{and as a result}} New South Wales lost its return match with the tourists, though Sydney did get two Tests. The Victoria Park Oval was a lovely ground, surrounded by bowling greens, croquet lawns, cricket and football fields, public parks and a zoo. The Country XI were overawed by Fred Trueman (4/45) in the first innings, with Len Coldwell taking 3/25 and David Allen 3/34 helping him dismiss them for 138. John Murray was wicket-keeping again after his injury in the Third Test and showed no ill effects. The MCC made 451/8 in return with David Sheppard (93) and captain Colin Cowdrey (97) added 151 before both getting out within minutes of stumps in the 98 degree heat. Graveney making the fastest century of the tour, 106 in 81 minutes and hit four sixes and Barry Knight hit a powerful 70. The Country XI survived the day to earn a draw even though Allen took 3/51, they made 227/5 thanks to the 24-year-old chemist Ian Drake. Drake was 'run out' on 59 when he hit the ball <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> and Umpire Clare signalled a boundary, but Ray Illingworth picked it up a foot inside and threw it to Murray, who broke the wicket and Umpire Miller gave him out. Cowdrey called him back to continue the innings and he made 101, the first century by a Country player against the MCC since the war.|$|E
25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel {{before he}} even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball crashing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family cheered and backed Hayden up to the hilt screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} began in an {{explosive}} fashion. While the first over {{of the day}} (bowled by Agarkar to Adam Gilchrist) yielded only 3 runs, the second over {{was the one that}} set the tone for a day which was morbidly frustrating for the bowlers and was heavily in favour of the batsmen. The second over of the day(Ashish Nehra to Gilchrist), and the 92nd over of the Australian innings fetched 12 runs. The scoring sequence was as follows: 3–0–0–1–4–4. But in the 96th over, Agarkar managed to stop the Gilchrist juggernaut when he had him to offer a catch to Sehwag for 29, made from only 24 balls. Australia, were still looking strong at 426/5 with Ponting still around for an undefeated 182. Ponting was moving sedately at a rather sluggish pace ever since he had reached 150, and seemed considerably slow before he broke off the shackles with two elegant and sweetly timed boundaries off Nehra in the 103rd over. Five balls later, Ponting brought up his double century of a mere 289 balls with another exquisite drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> When he reached his 200, he paused to blow a kiss to his wife. He had not only scored his second double century in what happened to be a prolific year for him, but also had stitched a valuable partnership with Andy Bichel, who had scored a gutsy 19 from 45 balls before Kumble had him dismissed. The Australians, though, gave the Indian bowlers and fielders no respite, as Jason Gillespie and Ponting came together to add a partnership of 83 runs, with Gillespie making merry with 48 from 53 balls, and Ponting had already raced to 242 from 350 balls by then. However, operating in his 43rd over, Kumble first got rid of Ponting and then picked up the remaining two Australian wickets off the last two balls of that over as well. This put a huge dent on the Australian hopes of making a 600-plus score.|$|E
