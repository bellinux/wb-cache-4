5|$|Caesar was now {{the primary}} figure of the Roman state, {{enforcing}} and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler.

5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|A solicitor, {{businessman}} and citizen soldier before his entry into politics, Gould {{was a member}} of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two Free Trade governments. He later served two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the Australian Senate. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second President of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and Anglophilic than his predecessor's.|$|E

5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H.

5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>in</b> this case.|$|E
5|$|As Associate Justices {{left the}} court in {{subsequent}} years, Washington appointed Thomas Johnson, William Paterson, and Samuel Chase.
