The game was designed based on a real case of professional integration, the InOut hostel near Barcelona, in which 90 % of the personal has a disability.

It has been designed in narrow col- laboration with educators and managers. It has been tested by users throughout its development and evaluated with a group of students with ID.

40|$|Objective: The {{most common}} blood-transmitted viruses are {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). The prevalence of these viruses varies by nationality and geography. At the study, it was considered that the 129 sanitary workers of Sivas municipality are risk group for the diseases of blood-transmitted viruses and was aimed to determine the HBV, HCV and HIV seroprevalence. Method: Blood samples were analyzed in the Sivas Public Health Laboratory. It were studied HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti HCV and anti HIV by Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (Abbott AxSYM) in sera samples. Results: It was found that HBsAg was positive in 5 (3. 87 ℅) and anti-HBs was in 45 (34. 88 %) individuals. While only one individual was determined as seropositive for anti HCV (0. 77 %), no one {{was found to be}} seropositive for HIV.

40|$|In text {{classification}} (TC) {{and other}} tasks involving supervised learning, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning and active learning are two strategies whose aim is maximizing {{the effectiveness of}} the resulting classifiers for a given amount of training effort. Both strategies have been actively investigated for TC in recent years. Much less research has been devoted to a third such strategy, <b>training</b> label <b>cleaning</b> (TLC), which consists in devising ranking functions that sort the original training examples in terms of how likely it is that the human annotator has mislabelled them. This provides a convenient means for the human annotator to revise the training set so as to improve its quality. Working in the context of boosting-based learning methods for multi-label classification we present three different techniques for performing TLC and, on three widely used TC benchmarks, evaluate them by their capability of spotting training documents that, for experimental reasons only, we have purposefully mislabelled. We also evaluate the degradation in classification effectiveness that these mislabelled texts bring about, and to what extent <b>training</b> label <b>cleaning</b> can prevent this degradation...|$|R

Features such as the position and stroke width of the preprinted entities (including form frames and instructions) are extracted. In the cleaning phase, the system registers the template to the input form by landmark alignment. The form frames are removed and the handwritings are restored by morphological operations. When the handwritings are found touching or crossing preprinted texts, morphological operations based on statistical features are used to clean them.
