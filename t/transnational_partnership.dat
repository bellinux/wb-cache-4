50|$|The {{main goal}} of the Rural Alliances project {{is to develop a}} {{transnational}} tool to capture rural vibrancy. Approaches like quality of life or vibrant communities refer to a presence of certain amenities and measure hard and soft location factors. A vibrant countryside {{is one of the main}} categories of the English Rural White Paper and relates to community involvement and activity. It distinguishes between vibrant, active, barely active, and sleeping parishes assessed on numbers of meeting places, voluntary and cultural activities, as well as contested parish elections. Together with a living, working and protected countryside the vibrant countryside is seen as part of a sustainable rural development. Community involvement, participation and inhabitants’ perceptions need to be integrated in such instruments. Therefore, vibrant rural communities follow the aim to develop and/or maintain social, cultural and economic benefit, adapt to change and improve quality of life for everyone within the community. This development is on-going, iterative and inclusive. Taking various national frames, cultural backgrounds, social behaviours and personal opinions into consideration lead to a broadly agreed definition, approach and implementation process. A rural development instrument is created by the <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership.</b> This is called Rural Vibes.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} a growing body of {{literature}} around establishing and facilitating transnational partnerships in higher education institutions, much of this work is around economic and quality assurance issues at the institutional level.

This article attempts, through the use of narrative, to explore the establishment of an affective relationship between a faculty of education in a large regional Australian university and a partner institution in the Asian region. The ‘space’ in which this relationship has been established is the focus. Reflecting upon the perceptual, sociological, ideological, political and ecological dimensions of the space (Gruenewald, 2003), {{it is clear that the}} issue of social relationships needs careful scrutiny.

40|$|Internationalisation {{in social}} work {{practice}} and education {{has been the subject}} of significant debate for over two decades, with increasing importance placed on developing global perspectives. In part, this has been accomplished through the development of international social work student exchanges and international field placements. While there are compelling reasons as to why international exchanges and placements are undertaken, there are many aspects of these activities that are not adequately explored in the literature. Of particular interest is the concept of <b>transnational</b> <b>partnerships</b> and how these are developed and sustained in and through international student exchanges. For example, many of the international exchange programs discussed in the social work literature are identified as unidirectional initiatives from the Global North, and the lack of reciprocity within their processes challenges the current conceptualisation of "exchange" and "partnership" in such contexts. This paper presents data collected from both Australian "source" universities, and institutions in the Asia Pacific which "host" Australian social work students on exchange or placement. Their perspectives on the nature of <b>transnational</b> <b>partnerships</b> in student exchange programs are described and the contested nature of "exchange" is explored...|$|R

With these partnership arrangements, traditional problems with student plagiarism can occur; however, the international nature of arrangements can also give rise to additional problems. In 2002 the Centre for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE) at the University of Melbourne was commissioned by the AUTC to produce a booklet entitled 'Assessing Learning in Australian Universities' which included a section entitled 'Minimising Plagiarism'. In this paper the authors address the question of how the responsibility for implementing anti plagiarism strategies should be shared in <b>transnational</b> <b>partnerships,</b> and identify and discuss the associated difficulties.

This practice based paper focuses upon the lived experience of staff in both locales, specifically exploring tangible impacts on pedagogy. Focus group discussions with academic and professional staff in both the Australian and Malaysian context were analysed to distil key themes and issues that emerged as they traversed geographical borders to develop new ways of working where a blended teaching and learning model is utilised. The importance of privileging a relational pedagogy, where relationships are seen {{as the foundation of}} good pedagogy, emerged as being of paramount importance in terms of building a safe, collaborative and dynamic culture and promoting effective teaching and learning in <b>transnational</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The authors posit that through explicit understanding of the co-creation of the cross-cultural teaching and learning space, the quality of the experience for staff and students can be enhanced. Clearly, the quality of staff interactions, relationships and friendships and their commitment to the total student learning journey positively impacted upon their job satisfaction. While the interpersonal relationships that have been established privilege connections between the socio-cultural context in which one is living and the differing contexts that others experience, {{it is also possible that}} the student learning journey is positively impacted as a consequence of the privileging of a relational pedagogical approach that sees connectedness as important. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{influence}} of institutional factors and practices on the student experience and development of organizational identification in students in the context of transnational university partnership programs, collaborations between a U. S. “home” institution and a “host” institution abroad offering degree programs through distributed delivery models. Organizational identification is known to benefit the institution, influencing effectiveness and long-term institutional strength, and student engagement and satisfaction, both during the program and when they become alumni. Previous research has established that contextual factors—both environmental and structural—influence the development of organizational identification in students in single university settings and that student identification with the institution is positively related to their future support of their alma mater when they become alumni. However, little, if any, research exists on how organizational identification develops in students in transnational university partnership programs and whether it will contribute to students 2 ̆ 7 desire to affiliate with and maintain a connection to one or both of the partner institutions when they become alumni. ^ Two Carnegie Mellon <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership</b> programs were examined through cross-case analysis: the Athens MSIN, a partnership program with Athens Information Technology in Athens, Greece, and the Chennai MSIT, offered through partnership with the SSN School of Advanced Software Engineering (SSN SASE), in Chennai, India. Each program utilizes a different approach and delivery model to offer its program and therefore provided the research with contrasting examples of transnational university partnership programs for exploration. ^ Findings from this study suggest that the student experience, which is shaped by environmental and structural factors in the delivery of the program, influences identification with the institution. Time spent at the home and host institutions, integration with other students enrolled at both institutions, the nature and degree of interaction with home and host institution faculty, the integration of the home institution culture into the program and access to home institution resources and services while at the host institution represent significant elements of the student experience in the context of <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership</b> programs that influence students 2 ̆ 7 sense of belonging to the institution. ...|$|E

Namely, the Indigenous Peoples of the Rio Negro and the Federation they formed in 1987, the Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Rio Negro [FOIRN] and the partnership it has established with the NGO Horizont 3000. FOIRN was created during a time of structural changes in Brazil and pushed into existence due to the marginalized and vulnerable position the Indigenous Peoples of the Rio Negro found themselves. Institutionalizing their fight the way they did secured their own existence as Indigenous Peoples by making it possible to ratify by official legislature and before the Brazilian government their right to maintain their livelihoods and “traditional” lifestyle, closely attached to the land. They did so mainly thanks to the <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership</b> established within the Climate Alliance framework, which provided the means for the Federation to exist and supported them in their fight for land demarcation, a goal they later managed to achieve.

40|$|How can {{indigenous}} communities in illiberal regimes benefit from oil production? This paper compares {{the experience of}} two indigenous peoples in the Russian Arctic, the Nenets and the Komi-Izhemtsi, {{in their quest for}} environmental protection and the development of benefit-sharing arrangements with Lukoil, a Russian oil company. The Nenets people, recognized by the Russian state as indigenous, are marginalized political actors who identified a route to receiving compensation for loss of land and damage to the environment as well as economic benefits under the auspices of Russian law and Lukoil’s corporate policies. In contrast, the Komi-Izhemtsi, despite indigenous status in global institutions including the United Nations and the Arctic Council, are unrecognized as indigenous domestically and initially received no compensation. Their path to benefit sharing was more challenging as they partnered with local nongovernmental organizations and global environmentalists to pressure Lukoil to sign a benefit-sharing agreement. Ultimately, the comparison illustrates how <b>transnational</b> <b>partnerships</b> can empower indigenous people to gain benefits from natural resource exploitation even in illiberal political systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} current shift in Australia’s higher {{education}} system {{moving to a}} more explicit, standards-based quality system and its potential impact on international partnerships in teaching and learning, particularly in Asia.

40|$|Based on the 1988 - 2006 General Household Survey (N= 121, 934), {{this paper}} investigates trends and {{patterns}} of partnership formation of immigrants in Britain and explains underlying factors influencing partner choice. The key questions are: 1) whom do the immigrants of different gender, generation and ethnic groups form partnerships with: (a White British partner, a British-born coethnic partner or a coethnic partner from overseas); and 2) what factors are explaining such a choice. Immigrants socialised in Britain, the second generation and those who migrated to Britain at a young age, {{are more likely to}} have a White British partner and less likely to be in a <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership.</b> Age at union, marital status, educational qualification, area ethnic composition, sex ratio and educational homogomy are significant predictors of one's partner choice. Yet, ethnic origin remains a crucial determinant of patterns of partnership formation. The statistical analysis suggests that the rates of interethnic union with a White British partner will continue to increase for Black Caribbean, Black Africans and also gradually for highly educated Indians. The proportion of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis having a White British partner will remain low and simultaneously transnational marriage with a coethnic partner from overseas will still be commonly practiced. Overall, interethnic partnerships between the White British population and the population with an immigrant background are increasing in Britain...|$|E
40|$|While the {{promotion}} {{and growth of}} global public-private partnerships (PPPs) is indisputable, the same enthusiasm has not fuelled their disciplined study; thus, their potential to deliver on their promise of being effective and legitimate governance entities is far from established. Addressing this lack, this work investigates the universe of transnational PPPs in form, functioning and effects. It suggests that as PPPs are institutional innovations, partnership analysis can benefit from applying theoretical constructs from international regime research complemented with adjacent literature from management and organisational studies. Building an analytical framework based on the notions of input and output legitimacy, the work analyses how variation in partnership inputs (focus, actors involved, organisational dynamics and institutionalisation) interacts with varying internal management processes to result in varying outputs. The thesis utilises the operational notion of effects rather than the more subjective notion of partnership effectiveness, and considers effects related to goal attainment and problem solving. Applying a systematic methodology, the work also defines and describes the universe of PPPs, creating a <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership</b> database (TPD) which pulls together all existing sources, thus encompassing 757 partnerships. The resultant analysis reveals a marked variation across the universe of transnational partnerships as well as distinct differences in their operational capacity. It also highlights that while highly institutionalised PPPs {{are more likely to}} produce tangible outputs and effects, the extent of these is highly dependent upon internal management. By building a cumulative understanding of these institutional models, the work furthers debates regarding the role of PPPs as legitimate and effective governing actors...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of educational opportunities internationally provides major prospects {{for developing countries}} to reform their education systems. The rise of new forms of transnational education, (the provision of education to learners in a country {{different from that of}} the provider) and the {{expansion of}} capacity building opportunities have helped developing nations to increase domestic access to international education and to enhance the quality of their local education systems through increasing the variety and relevance of their programmes. Pakistan, being a developing nation, faces huge educational challenges due to its highly rigid and bureaucratic system of education. It also faces a lack of resources and training opportunities to enhance and expand the capabilities of teachers and educational leaders. However, community based, not-for-profit institutions in Pakistan are making every effort to improve the quality of education through providing capacity building opportunities to teachers and educational leaders. Notre Dame Institute of Education (NDIE) in Karachi is one such kind of institute. It is affiliated with Karachi University (KU) and accredited with Australian Catholic University (ACU) and offers an M. Ed. programme for educational leaders. This study explores the effectiveness of the transnational M. Ed. programme at NDIE as a means of educational leadership capacity building in Pakistan. The main research problem was examined through four research questions which explored: the distinctive elements of the M. Ed. programme offered at NDIE and its focus on capacity building; the contextual factors contributing to this capacity building; the impact of the M. Ed. programme on the development of the leadership capacity of its graduates; and finally the contributions of this case study research to the understanding of issues related to transnational education focusing on educational capacity building. A qualitative approach, in the form of case study, was adopted for the research. The data was collected by means of survey questionnaires distributed to all the M. Ed. graduates; in-depth individual interviews and focus group interviews of selected graduates and NDIE teachers; analysis of the documents related to the M. Ed. programme and the <b>transnational</b> <b>partnership</b> between ACU and NDIE, and the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s reflective journal. The comprehensive narrative indicates the use of appropriate means of qualitative data reduction, analysis and display. This study highlights the contribution of the NDIE M.

Using the United Nations Development Programme 2 ̆ 7 s framework (2009), this study also provides insights into the process of capacity building through the transfer and successful application of knowledge, expertise and methodologies from one educational context into another very different educational context. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights into the contribution of ACU, Australian Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Education system to educational leadership capacity building in Pakistan.
