5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E

Asked specifically about the Supreme Court ruling, 39 percent said they approve and 41 percent said they disapprove.|$|E
25|$|Opossums {{are usually}} solitary and nomadic, staying {{in one area}} as long as food and water are easily available. Some {{families}} will group together in ready-made burrows or even under houses. Though they will temporarily occupy abandoned burrows, they do not dig or put much effort into building their own. As nocturnal animals, <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> dark, secure areas. These areas may be below ground or above.|$|E
25|$|Bobcat (Lynx rufus, {{also called}} Felis rufus) — <b>They</b> <b>favor</b> {{thickets}} and patchy woods in the least-developed {{areas of the}} state, especially in the northwest highlands of Connecticut; they normally are scarce where coyotes are more prevalent. It is unknown {{whether or not the}} burgeoning coyote population has resulted in a decline in bobcats, however. Unlike coyotes, bobcats do not adapt well to nearby human populations; they prefer immature forests with a thick understory. In the 1970s the price of bobcat pelts rose so much that state officials became concerned they would be overharvested and reclassified the bobcat as a protected furbearer, with no hunting or trapping seasons. A rabid bobcat attacked a man in Plainville in 2003, but the incident is regarded as a rare, freak occurrence.|$|E

25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and Chenopodium album. In early summer <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, Przewalski horses experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E
25|$|Any kind {{of animal}} that often visits or {{encounters}} flowers {{is likely to}} be a pollen vector to some extent. For example, a crab spider that stops at one flower for a time and then moves on, might carry pollen incidentally, but most pollen vectors of significant interest are those that routinely visit the flowers for some functional activity. They might feed on pollen, or plant organs, or on plant secretions such as nectar, and carry out acts of pollination on the way. Many plants bear flowers that favour certain types of pollinator over all others. This need not always be an effective strategy, because some flowers that are of such a shape that <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> pollinators that pass by their anthers and stigmata on the way to the nectar, may get robbed by ants that are small enough to bypass the normal channels, or by short-tongued bees that bite through the bases of deep corolla tubes to extract nectar at the end opposite to the anthers and stigma. Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness. Other flowers will attract pollinators by odor. For example, bee species such as Euglossa cordata are attracted to orchids this way, and it has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to the orchid flowers, which last up to 90 minutes. However, in general, plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured, but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated. They also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{researchers}} generally {{believe that}} sexual orientation is not determined by any one factor {{but by a}} combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, with biological factors involving a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment, <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> biological models for the cause. They believe that sexual orientation is not a choice, and some of them believe that it is established at conception. That is, individuals do not choose to be homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual. Current scientific investigation usually seeks to find biological explanations for the adoption of a particular sexual orientation. [...] Scientific studies have found a number of statistical biological differences between gay people and heterosexuals, which may result from the same underlying cause as sexual orientation itself.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the Energy Information Administration {{projected}} almost 17 gigawatts of {{new nuclear}} power reactors by 2030, {{but in its}} 2011 projections, it [...] "scaled back the 2030 projection to just five". Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropped to 43%, slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. A survey conducted in April 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans opposed {{the construction of new}} nuclear reactors. A survey sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute, conducted in September 2011, found that [...] "62 percent of respondents said <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> the use of nuclear energy as one of the ways to provide electricity in the United States, with 35 percent opposed".|$|E
2500|$|Other studies provide {{evidence}} that adoptive relationships can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes, [...] "...adoptive parents enrich their children's lives {{to compensate for the}} lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption." [...] Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because <b>they</b> <b>favor</b> them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{patients}} have been advised to immobilize their shoulders {{for six weeks}} before doing rehabilitation. However, the appropriate timing and intensity of therapy are subject to debate. Regardless, most surgeons advocate {{to remain in the}} sling for at least six weeks. [...] Some authorities advocate early, aggressive rehab. <b>They</b> <b>favor</b> the use of passive motion, which allows a patient to move the shoulder without physical effort. [...] Alternatively, some authorities argue that therapy should be started later and carried out more cautiously. Theoretically, that gives tissues time to heal; though there is conflicting data regarding the benefits of early immobilization. A study of rats suggested that it improved the strength of surgical repairs, while research on rabbits produced contrary evidence. Patients, especially those recovering from large rotator cuff tears, are prone to developing new tears. Rehabbing too soon or too strenuously might increase the risk of retear or failure to heal. However, no research has proven a link between early therapy and the incidence of re-tears. [...] In some studies, patients who received earlier and more aggressive therapy reported reduced shoulder pain, less stiffness and better range of motion. Other research has shown that accelerated rehab results in better shoulder function. Ross et al. note that, despite the findings, [...] "no definitive consensus exists supporting a clinical difference" [...] between the two methods of rehab.|$|E
2500|$|Edit wars {{can also}} occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version <b>they</b> <b>favor.</b> In some cases, editors with {{opposing}} views of which content should appear or what formatting style {{should be used}} will change and re-change each other's edits. This results in the page being [...] "unstable" [...] from a general users' perspective, because each time a general user comes to the page, it may look different. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a {{decision has been made}} on what version of the page would be most appropriate. Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions {{can be traced back to}} the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies. The issue of wiki vandalism is debated.

2500|$|Some rock musicians today use mandolins, often single-stringed {{electric}} models {{rather than}} double-stringed acoustic mandolins. One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound <b>they</b> <b>favor.</b> The 1991 R.E.M. hit [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{was driven by}} a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs.
