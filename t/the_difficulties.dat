40|$|Objectives: The {{impact of}} {{preoperative}} endoscopic therapy on <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic Heller myotomy {{and the impact}} of <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of <b>the</b> myotomy on long-term outcome has not been determined. This study was undertaken to determine whether preoperative therapy impacts <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic Heller myotomy and whether preoperative therapy or difficulty of myotomy impacts long-term outcomes. Methods: Since 1992, 305 patients, 56 % male, median age 49 years, underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy and were prospectively followed. <b>The</b> <b>difficulty</b> of <b>the</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy was scored by the operating surgeon for the most recent 170 consecutive patients on a scale of 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult). Patients scored their symptoms before and after myotomy using a Likert scale from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Results: Before myotomy, 66 % of patients underwent endoscopic therapy: 33 % dilation, 11 % Botox, and 22 % both. Preoperative endoscopic therapy did not correlate with <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of <b>the</b> myotomy (P�NS). Median follow-up was 25 months. Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of <b>the</b> myotomy, dysphagia improved with myotomy (P� 0. 0001). By regression analysis, the frequency and severity of postmyotomy dysphagia correlated with neither preoperative endoscopic therapy nor <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of <b>the</b> myotomy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver resections are related to both patient and tumour factors, however <b>the</b> available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems only incorporate tumour factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the opinion of laparoscopic liver surgeons regarding the factors that affect <b>the</b> perceived <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver resections. METHOD: Using a Visual Analogue Scale an international survey of laparoscopic liver surgeons was undertaken to assess <b>the</b> perceived <b>difficulty</b> of 26 factors previously demonstrated to affect <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of a laparoscopic liver resection. RESULTS: 80 surgeons with a combined experience of over 7000 laparoscopic liver resections responded to <b>the</b> survey. <b>The</b> <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver surgery was suggested to be increased by a BMI > 35 by 89 % of respondents; neo-adjuvant chemotherapy by 79 %; repeated liver resection by 99 % and concurrent procedures by 59 % however these factors have not been included in <b>the</b> previous <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems. CONCLUSION: The results suggests that <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of laparoscopic liver surgery is not fully assessed by <b>the</b> available <b>difficulty</b> scoring systems and prompts the development of a new difficulty score that incorporates all factors believed to increase difficulty. </p...|$|R
