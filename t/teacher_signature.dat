40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Delphi study was to {{identify}} the purpose, expected outcomes, and methods of documenting preservice teacher early field experience (EFE) activities in agricultural teacher education programs. A Delphi technique was used to electronically collect data via email and SurveyMonkey®. An expert panel was established and after three rounds of questioning, the panel identified 16 purpose statements, 14 activities and 9 methods of documenting EFE. The findings of this study, as established by a panel of experts who reached consensus, indicated that EFE should be documented via a combination of journaling and portfolio development. The verification of these documents should be completed by the cooperating teacher and through university assessments. Documentation of an EFE experience can be accomplished through journaling, cooperating <b>teacher</b> <b>signature,</b> reflective paper or a review of collective documents. The results of this study can be used to modify and improve EFE by clarifying the purpose, activities and ways of documented activities in agricultural teacher education programs. This study will aid the profession in providing a more congruent EFE experience for preservice teachers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{national}} study was to describe agricultural teacher education early field experience (EFE) practices using the EFE model. The population {{for this study was}} all agricultural education teacher preparation programs (N = 83) listed in the AAAE Directory of University Faculty in Agricultural Education. Data were collected via an online survey sent to a single point of contact (i. e., the agricultural teacher education coordinator) at each institution. For this study, EFE was defined as all field experiences that occur prior to student teaching; the experiences could be offered within or outside of the agricultural education curriculum. Programs required a minimum number of contact hours and a minimum number of lessons to be taught while in the field. The most common forms of assessment were the university supervisor’s review of documents, cooperating <b>teacher</b> <b>signatures,</b> reflective writing, and student journaling. This study has implications for agricultural teacher education programs that are planning to evaluate or revamp their current EFE programs. Developing consistency across programs will provide a better experience for all students involved in agricultural education EFE...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the three studies in this {{dissertation}} was to enhance career and technical education {{in the area of}} agriculture, business, and family and consumer sciences. This dissertation contains three papers: (1) a Delphi study identifying the purpose, expected outcomes, and methods of documenting preservice teacher early field experience (EFE) activities in agricultural teacher education programs; (2) a national descriptive study describing agricultural teacher education early field experience (EFE) practices using the EFE Model; and (3) a national descriptive study describing business, and family and consumer sciences teacher education early field experience (EFE) practices using the EFE Model. For all studies an early field experience (EFE) was defined as all field experiences that occur prior to student teaching and the experiences could be offered within or outside of the agricultural education curriculum. Programs required minimum number of contact hours and minimum number of lessons to be taught while in the field. The most commonly identified student assessments included: the university supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s review of documents, cooperating <b>teacher</b> <b>signatures,</b> reflective writing, and student journaling. The studies supports the career and technical education profession by identifying differences and similarities in EFE programming in an effort to provide a more congruent EFE experience for preservice teachers. All three studies can be used to modify and improve EFE in career and technical education in the area of agriculture, business, and family and consumer sciences. The studies will aid the profession in providing a more congruent EFE experience for preservice teachers...|$|R
