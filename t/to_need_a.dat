Regular plasma infusions are necessary {{in patients with}} frequent relapses and in general situations with increased risk to develop an acute episode (as seen above) such as pregnancy.

A bandeau may come with a detachable halter strap, for extra support. A strapless bandeau, or tube top, was also worn as casual wear and sports wear starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes worn {{as part of a}} sportswear ensemble. Actress Halle Berry wore a skimpy bikini top with matching pants to the MTV Video Music Award, fueling the trend of wearing a bandeau top as an out-of-home dress.|$|E

25|$|On 24 November 2016, the Canadian {{government}} announced that starting from 25 November 2016, Mexican nationals {{can apply for}} the eTA online. However, Mexicans entering Canada before 1 December would continue <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> visa. On the same day, Mexican nationals could no longer apply for a visa online and had to apply on paper through a visa application centre. The visa requirement was lifted on 1 December as planned and the issuance of visas to Mexican nationals ceased, although Statistics Canada predicts that the net cost of lifting the visa requirement is over C$262 million in the next decade, which includes the additional immigration enforcement resources and the extra costs of processing asylum claims.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{abolished}} previous existing {{local government}} structures, {{and created a}} two-tier system of counties and districts everywhere. Some of the new counties were designated metropolitan counties, containing metropolitan boroughs instead. The allocation of functions differed between the metropolitan and the non-metropolitan areas (the so-called 'shire counties') — for example, education and social services were {{the responsibility of the}} shire counties, but in metropolitan areas was given to the districts. The distribution of powers was slightly different in Wales than in England, with libraries being a county responsibility in England—but in Wales districts could opt to become library authorities themselves. One key principle was that education authorities (non-metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts), were deemed <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> population base of 250,000 in order to be viable.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

25|$|Another {{tradition}} of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities. These {{grew out of}} the earlier revels and had become evident by the 15th century in places like Rome, and Venice, where they developed as entertainments to enliven towns and cities. Thus the Maundy Thursday carnival in St Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of 'commedia dell'arte' inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole 'season' from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he was ugly enough not <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the C 18th heyday were revived. It appears other cities in central Europe were influenced by the Venetian model.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the 2004 opening of the Garden, the {{perennials}} were expected <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> year or two to mature and the hedges were expected to need another five to ten years to fill out. [...] Another Tribune critic, Beth Botts, noted that the historical symbolism of the plantings is a future pleasure to be anticipated. However, she noted that it would be many years before the rosebud trees to the east could provide a pleasant shade. By the July/August 2010 issue of Garden Design, the garden was described as a garden in maturity worth revisiting.|$|E

Claiming <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> rest, he missed his scheduled flight and arrived four days late. His absence {{may have contributed to}} Northamptonshire's elimination in the preliminary stages of the Benson and Hedges Cup. At the time, members of the county were unhappy with Ambrose's performances for the team; the committee fined him, and he expressed contrition. During the remainder of the season, he bowled extremely effectively to take 77 first-class wickets, the most for the club in 18 years, at an average of 14.45 to top the national bowling averages. According to Andrew Radd in Wisden, the club were mollified by his success, but he wrote: [...] "Rarely in Northamptonshire's history have the performances and the personality of one cricketer dominated a season to the extent that Curtly Ambrose did in 1994." [...] Ambrose missed the final match of the season with a shoulder problem.|$|E

Ferguson offered a similar view, saying that Whitehall delivered [...] "seriously undeliverable lines with entirely believable gusto". Tate said that though he found the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode fairly predictable, the [...] "writing and performances were so engaging that it hardly mattered". The episode was, for him, [...] "inventive" [...] and [...] "deliciously wicked". Similarly, though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical, he said that the writers [...] "scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution". Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described [...] "La Couchette" [...] as [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "sharply observed". He commended the cast, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith [...] "give a mini-masterclass" [...] in their performances. Jones called the episode [...] "toilet humour with a twist", saying that [...] "It was Jorg's grunting and squatting that produced the episode's impressively grotesque climax, but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line: 'We're going <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> bigger box!'" [...] Billen commended the cast, and Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website PopMatters, described Gunning as one of the stand-out guest stars of the second series.|$|E

2500|$|Eliya IX (1617–60) did not consecrate bishops for the {{historic}} dioceses of Erbil, Nisibis, and Hesna d’Kifa, probably because their East Syrian communities {{were no longer}} large enough <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> bishop, and during his reign the Mosul patriarchate consisted of six metropolitan dioceses: [...] Amid, Mardin, Gazarta, Seert, Mosul and Salmas.

She attended private Catholic schools, including Saint John the Baptist (Yonkers, New York) and Maria Regina High School. Linda was nicknamed [...] "Miss Holy Holy" [...] in high school because she kept her dates at a safe distance. When Boreman was 16, her family moved to Davie, Florida after her father retired from the New York City Police Department. At age 20, she gave birth to her first child, which her mother gave up for adoption. [...] Shortly afterwards, Linda returned to New York City to live and go to computer school. There, she was involved in an automobile accident, sustaining injuries that were serious enough to require her to undergo a blood transfusion.
