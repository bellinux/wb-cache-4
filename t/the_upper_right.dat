5|$|The stella octangula, a {{compound}} of two tetrahedra that appears in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> of Stars, also forms the central shape of another of Escher's astronomical works, Double Planetoid (1949). The compound of cube and octahedron in the upper left was used earlier by Escher, in Crystal (1947).|$|E

5|$|Arms: A {{coat of arms}} {{consisting}} of a shield divided into quarters. In the upper left and lower right quarter, a red eagle, its wings outstretched. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> quarter shows a ship with furled sails, while in the lower left quarter a red hand grasps a blue cross. A cow, standing on two hooves, appears {{on either side of}} the shield. The shield is surmounted by a silver helmet above which there is a hand grasping a dagger.|Coat of arms of the chief of Clan MacIntyre.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. Elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.|$|E
5|$|Since Warhol gave no {{indication}} of a definitive ordering of the collection, the sequence chosen by MoMA (in the picture at <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> of this article) in the display from their permanent collection reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with Tomato in the upper left, which debuted in 1897. By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving Clam Chowder to the upper left and tomato {{to the bottom of}} the four rows.|$|E

5|$|A smaller, single-panel oil {{painting}} by Lichtenstein {{around the same}} time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an air-to-air missile at a second plane that is exploding in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right,</b> with a word bubble. The same issue of All-American Men of War was the inspiration {{for at least three}} other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right,</b> and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E

5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right,</b> {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right,</b> the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E
5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when energy generation by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E

5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> corner of the diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing {{the sum of the}} vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of the}} stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>right</b> have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
