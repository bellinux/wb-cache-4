5|$|One of {{the most}} well known and for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by <b>the</b> <b>respected</b> University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people {{with an interest in}} western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.|$|E

50|$|On 3 November 2007, Galloway's camp {{announced}} plans to hold <b>the</b> <b>Respect</b> Renewal conference on 17 November, {{the same day as}} the planned national conference of <b>Respect.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Respect</b> Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended, comparable with <b>the</b> <b>Respect</b> national conference, although the figure was disputed by Chris Harman in the SWP's International Socialism. This split continued with both <b>Respect</b> Renewal and <b>the</b> SWP-led faction claiming to be <b>the</b> real <b>Respect.</b> Respect Renewal, through Linda Smith, had control over the use of <b>the</b> <b>Respect</b> name in elections, while the SWP-led faction used the electoral label Left List, but did control <b>the</b> original <b>Respect</b> website. Both <b>the</b> <b>Respect</b> Renewal faction, as 'Respect (George Galloway)', and Left List stood in the 2008 London Assembly elections.

5|$|Kagame {{began his}} primary {{education}} in a school near the refugee camp, where he and other Rwandan refugees learned English and began to integrate into Ugandan culture. At the age of nine he moved to <b>the</b> <b>respected</b> Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10 mi) away, graduating with the best grades in the district. He subsequently attended Ntare School, {{one of the best}} schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The death of Kagame's father in the early 1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population. He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School.|$|E

5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, <b>the</b> <b>respected</b> former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E

Asad was placed {{at the head of the}} expedition even while retaining his office of qadi, normally incompatible with a military post. The Muslim expeditionary forces is said to have consisted of ten thousand foot soldiers and seven hundred cavalry, mostly Ifriqiyan Arabs and Berbers, but possibly also some Khurasanis. The fleet comprised seventy or a hundred ships, to which were added Euphemius' own vessels.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by <b>the</b> <b>respected</b> weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
