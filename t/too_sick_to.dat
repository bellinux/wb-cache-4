5|$|Before the film's {{worldwide}} release date, Pixar {{granted a}} wish from 10-year-old Colby Curtin {{to see the}} film before she died. Colby {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer and was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD of the finished film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film.|$|E
5|$|Though Endeavour {{was now in}} good condition, {{her crew}} were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> attend their duties. Over the {{following}} twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.|$|E
5|$|Later, Weed {{encounters}} a dog named Yukimura, and learns {{that a group}} of monkeys have been terrorizing the area. Leading them is Shōgun, a vicious baboon that feeds on young monkeys and puppies. Shōgun had previously attacked Yukimura and his family, permanently damaging his adopted father Saheiji. Weed, his comrades, Yukimura, and several rebellious monkeys attack Shōgun and his followers. Yukimura is able to injure Shōgun enough to ensure his death, but dies in the process. Saheiji reveals that Yukimura was Weed's brother: Sakura, <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> care for all of her children, had given two of her puppies to Saheiji to raise as foster sons.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} have the {{goodness}} to explain," [...] said Annot, <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> at heart <b>to</b> be amused by Sir Dugald's airs of pedantic gallantry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colfax," [...] said Stephen, coming forward, [...] "you're <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> a man <b>to</b> talk. I'll {{look up the}} General. It may be that I {{can have}} you sent North to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|The barber-gillie, who was {{a doctor}} too, {{was called in to}} {{prescribe}} for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his opinion, and was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> even <b>to</b> ask for a translation. I knew well enough I was ill, and that was all I cared about.|$|R
5|$|Originally, the KGB general {{set up by}} Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> {{handle the}} major role, and the {{character}} of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly {{at the end of}} the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A-ha (which performed the film's title song), was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in the film, but declined, because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting.|$|E
5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> preside over the court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease. The jurisdiction of the court {{came to an end}} on September 1, 1896, over lands in the Indian Territory; reporters wanted to interview him about his career but had to talk to him at his bedside. Parker died on November 17, 1896, of a number of health conditions, including heart degeneration and Bright's disease. His funeral in Fort Smith had the highest number of attenders up to that point. He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not know}} in the least what he could mean, but she was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> at heart <b>to</b> ask; she only thought he looked unwell, jaded, and fagged, and with a heated complexion.|$|R
50|$|Alan Menken's {{longtime}} collaborator, Howard Ashman, was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> from AIDS <b>to</b> {{work with}} Menken on this film, {{and he would}} eventually die on March 14, 1991. Menken brought in lyricist Jack Feldman to help.|$|R
50|$|Accounts of the {{hospital}} in eighteenth-century French orientalist literature expanded the kinds of animals cared for to include lice and other blood sucking vermin and to include cattle, goat, and dogs <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> or old <b>to</b> work.|$|R
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> attend.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had {{lost sight of}} each other and continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's harbourmaster sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E
25|$|In February 1943, {{approximately}} 10,000 Białystok Jews were {{deported to}} the Treblinka extermination camp. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed <b>too</b> weak or <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> travel, were killed.|$|R
60|$|Yvonne {{felt her}} knees giving way under her. There {{was nothing more}} to hope for now--nothing. She felt herself lifted from the ground--she was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> and faint <b>to</b> realise what was happening: through the din which filled her ears she vainly tried to {{distinguish}} her father's voice again.|$|R
50|$|Bergen-Belsen {{concentration}} camp had three satellite camps. These were at regional armament works. Around 2,000 female {{concentration camp}} prisoners {{were forced to}} work there. Those who were <b>too</b> weak or <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> continue with their work were brought to Bergen-Belsen.|$|R
25|$|During the week, ITV were {{uncertain}} if Vickers {{would be}} able to perform due to her continued illness, and raised the question of whether she should be given another week off if she was still <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> sing. It was, however, later confirmed that she would appear.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of the battle 4,035 British were listed sick, a few hundred of these were <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> embark and were left behind. Two more {{transports}} were lost with about 300 troops mostly from the King's German Legion. By the time the army returned to England four days later some 6,000 were ill, with the sick returns listed at Portsmouth and Plymouth alone as 5,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to secure the cura of a medicus. If the patient was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> move one sent for a clinicus, who went to the clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work). In {{addition}} were the eye doctor, ocularius, the ear doctor, auricularius, and the doctor of snakebites, the marsus.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion Fourteen {{percent of}} {{patients}} considered for ICU admission are refused, and the ratio <b>too</b> well/too <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> benefit of 1.4 suggests an early referral practice in these patients. The reasons for refusal, e.g., performance status and quality of life, remain unchanged during the last decade. The decision of non-admission of a patient with hematological malignancy in the ICU is made consensually by participating physicians and is taken comfortably {{in the majority of}} cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jims, when {{he thinks}} about me. He doesn't often think about me. He has <b>too</b> many <b>sick</b> {{children}} <b>to</b> think about. <b>Sick</b> children are all Uncle Walter cares about. He's the greatest children's doctor in the Dominion, Mr. Burroughs says. But he is a woman-hater." ...|$|R
60|$|We rowed him aboard in {{much better}} style than he had come ashore, and saw for {{ourselves}} the helplessness of the passengers. There were a dozen men and women, {{and all of them}} <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> even <b>to</b> appear grateful at our coming. The yacht was rolling savagely, broad on, and no sooner had the owner's feet touched the deck than he collapsed and joined, the others. Not one was able to bear a hand, so Charley and I between us cleared the badly tangled running gear, got up sail, and hoisted anchor.|$|R
25|$|Grant's force then {{proceeded}} to burn the fifteen Middle Towns and all the crops. Grant expressly ordered the troops to summarily execute any Indian man, woman or child they captured. Although, by July, Grant had marched his men to exhaustion with 300 <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> walk, he had wrecked the Cherokee economy and made 4,000 inhabitants of the Middle Towns homeless and starving. In August 1761 the Cherokee sued for peace.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{were so bad}} at Flößberg, {{that the}} commandant told the SS to make some improvements, not because {{of concern for the}} prisoners' welfare, but because missile {{production}} and therefore, the war effort, would be negatively affected. One of Kotkowsky's friends found the conditions so unbearable, he took the opportunity to be returned to Buchenwald with a transport of prisoners <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> work, betting his chances of survival against the odds.|$|E
25|$|Ruby Bates was {{apparently}} <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> travel. She had had surgery in New York, {{and at one}} point Leibowitz requested that her deposition be taken as a dying declaration. While she was not dying, committed to his three-day time limit for the trial, Judge Callahan denied the request to arrange to take her deposition. Although the defense needed her testimony, by the time a deposition arrived, the case had gone to the jury and they did not hear it at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{designers}} {{were divided}} into 4 teams of 3. they are then given a task to create designs according to their given dishes. At {{the middle of the}} first day, Celine who was <b>too</b> <b>sick,</b> was allowed <b>to</b> rest, leaving an annoyed Jinggay and Vin who was left to create their piece. After the next day Celine returned to finish her design.|$|R
6000|$|... "We cannot all be Bayards, Prince, {{and most}} of us would, methinks, be <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> at sea <b>to</b> be of much assistance, were we to go. But if the Dutchmen come here, which is not likely--for I doubt not, Prince, that you will soon send them flying back to their own ports--we shall all be glad to do our best to meet them when they land." ...|$|R
60|$|Though {{there were}} {{numerous}} traces of hunting parties and encampments, they were not of recent date. The country seemed deserted. The only human beings they met with were three Pawnee squaws, in a hut {{in the midst of}} a deserted camp. Their people had all gone to the south, in pursuit of the buffalo, and had left these poor women behind, being <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> and infirm <b>to</b> travel.|$|R
25|$|In late 1969, Richard Street, {{lead singer}} of Motown act the Monitors and a former Distant, was hired by Otis Williams to tour with {{the group as a}} backup {{replacement}} for Williams. For most shows, save for his solo numbers, Williams would dance and lip-sync on stage to parts sung live by Street into an offstage mic behind a curtain. At other shows, and during most of the second half of 1970, Street substituted for Williams on stage when he was <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> go on.|$|E
25|$|By 1790 the {{situation}} had stabilised. The population of about 2,000 was adequately housed and fresh food was being grown. Phillip assigned a convict, James Ruse, land at Rose Hill (now Parramatta) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony. Other convicts followed his example. Sirius was wrecked in March 1790 at the satellite settlement of Norfolk Island, depriving Phillip of vital supplies. In June 1790 the Second Fleet arrived with hundreds more convicts, most of them <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E
25|$|Jack Lowe Sr.’s father, John Burford Lowe, was a {{traveling}} insurance salesman who often left his wife, Florence, and their infant son behind while travelling. In 1913 or 1914, J.B. Lowe left {{his wife and}} baby in New Orleans. Needing money, Mrs. Florence Lowe spoke to {{the owner of a}} grocery store and he agreed to give her enough money for milk and food in exchange for her working at his store. However, she later fell <b>too</b> <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> work and earn money. The grocer got in touch with Mrs. Lowe’s mother who moved Mrs. Lowe and baby to Farmerville, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Police {{dogs are}} retired {{if they become}} injured to an extent where they will not recover completely, pregnant, or raising puppies, or are <b>too</b> old or <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} working. Since many dogs are raised in working environments {{for the first year}} of their life and retired before they become unable to perform, the working life of a K9 is 6–9 years.|$|R

So Lamberth should send him home.”Rosenberg notes the motion cites “Army regulations that recommend repatriation of POWs who are so sick they can’t recover”, and that the “Geneva Conventions require a war prisoner be sent home if his mental or physical fitness 'have been gravely diminished.'” ...|$|R
60|$|It came {{none too}} soon for me, and I was so {{exhausted}} that I had to be helped off my mustang. Stockton arranged my blankets, fed me, and bathed the bruise on my head, but I was <b>too</b> weary and <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> be grateful or to care about anything except sleep. Even {{the fact that my}} hands were uncomfortably bound did not keep me awake.|$|R
