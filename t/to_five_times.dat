5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium. Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
5|$|The term Wicca {{appears to}} have {{developed}} within the Pagan Witchcraft community during the early 1960s, as increasing numbers of Pagan Witches learned of the Old English term wicca, the etymological origin of the Modern term witch. This etymological fact had been referred <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> in Gerald Gardner's book The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959), {{as well as in}} other early texts propagating Pagan Witchcraft, such as Doreen Valiente's Where Witchcraft Lives (1962) and Justine Glass' Witchcraft, The Sixth Sense – and Us (1965). None of these specifically referred to the Pagan Witchcraft religion as Wicca.|$|E

5|$|Under Weinberg's {{tenure as}} director, ORNL's Biology Division grew <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> {{the size of}} the next largest {{division}}. This division was charged with understanding how ionizing radiation interacts with living things and to try to find ways to help them survive radiation damage, such as bone marrow transplants. In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundation— Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs are up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> greater {{during the day}} because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E

LeMond responded: [...] "Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours." ...|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s, the {{services}} were gradually {{taken over by}} Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft and helicopters. These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
5|$|Pick became traffic {{development}} officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed {{that the best way to}} do so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the older generation systems. The game allows for up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the number of on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, and spray graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E
5|$|The City of London's first {{reconstruction}} {{plan was}} written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.|$|E
