5|$|Pietro Colonna {{and three}} bishops brought {{the news of}} Morrone's {{election}} to his mountain-top hermitage. Contemporary sources are emphatic in noting Morrone's reluctance <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election; for example, Petrarch recounts his attempt to flee.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} the attack, RUC {{officers}} questioned Stephen Travers at Dublin Castle. He subsequently stated they refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> description of the different-coloured beret worn by the soldier with the English accent. The UVF gunmen had worn green UDR berets, whereas the other man's had been lighter in colour.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> government.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election when {{word of the}} cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|The Vinaypatrika is {{considered}} {{as the last}} compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling him. In this work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti ("devotion"), and <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of Vinaypatrika that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work. The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening Aarti by many Hindus.|$|E
60|$|Never had I {{seen his}} {{beautiful}} eyes so brightly soft, so irresistibly tender, {{as they appeared}} now. He {{held out his hand}} to me. It is one of my small merits to be (in the popular phrase) as good as my word. I took his hand; well knowing that the action committed me <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>his</b> friendship.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his family}} moved to the United States in 1972 Paul earned degrees from Sacramento College (California) and Glassboro College (New Jersey) as well as {{finishing}} the international training institution of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement in North America.

5000|$|AVN founder Paul Fishbein, who {{presented}} the AVN Special Achievement awards, announced {{they were being}} renamed the Reuben Sturman Memorial Award to honor Sturman for his contributions to the industry. Meanwhile, when Howard Stern refused <b>to</b> attend and <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> Achievement Award, Beetlejuice took to the podium <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> on <b>his</b> behalf and [...] "rambled incomprehensibly" [...] {{and had to be}} interrupted to stop what seemed like an endless speech.|$|R
5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard to lighten the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato {{keep an eye on the}} political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola. The betrothal of Stephen III to an unnamed daughter of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Prince of Halych, was also arranged around this time.|$|E
5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys {{the set of the}} film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

50|$|Edwin Howard Simmons {{was born}} on August 25, 1921, in Paulsboro, New Jersey, and {{graduated}} from Paulsboro High School in 1938. He earned a bachelor of arts in journalism in 1942 at Lehigh University, {{where he had been}} elected to Phi Beta Kappa the previous year, and a master's degree in journalism in 1955 at Ohio State University. Prior <b>to</b> <b>accepting</b> <b>his</b> commission as a Marine second lieutenant on June 12, 1942, he held an Army Reserve commission.|$|R
5|$|Andrew was the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal nuncio (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already been fascinated by altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about clerical celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle would promote his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> uncle's decision.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{forced the}} Armenian rulers of Cilicia <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> {{suzerainty}} {{in the late}} 1180s. He also secured the County of Tripoli for his second son, Bohemond, in 1187. However, Saladin occupied almost the whole Principality of Antioch {{in the summer of}} 1188. To preserve the peace with Saladin, Bohemond did not provide military assistance to the crusaders during the Third Crusade. Leo of Cilicia's expansionist policy in the 1190s gave rise to a lasting conflict between Antioch and Cilicia. Bohemond was captured in 1194 by Leo, who tried to seize Antioch, but the burghers formed a commune and expelled the Armenian soldiers from the town. Bohemond was released only after he acknowledged Leo's independence.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond of Tripoli {{regarded}} himself his father's lawful heir, {{because he}} was Bohemond's elder surviving son. He came to Antioch {{at the end of}} 1198 and persuaded the commune <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to Tripoli, enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son's coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen's interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for}} his son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{grew up in}} an old priory in the Leicestershire {{village of}} Knipton and went hunting from the age of seven. She had a close {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b> <b>His</b> death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E
5|$|From 1642, Charles {{fought the}} armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he {{surrendered}} to a Scottish force that eventually handed {{him over to the}} English Parliament. Charles refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, {{but by the end of}} 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. The monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660.|$|E

5|$|In Karhide, {{the king}} is {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
