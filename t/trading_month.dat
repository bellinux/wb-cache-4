40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between weather (temperature) and stock market returns using daily data from Portugal; also, to examine whether the temperature is driven by calendar-related anomalies such as the January and <b>trading</b> <b>month</b> effects. Design/methodology/approach – Daily financial and weather data from Lisbon Stock Exchange (PSI 20 index) and Lisbon capital for the period 1995 - 2007 are considered. The paper employs an AR(1) -TGARCH(1, 1) model under several distributional assumptions (Normal, Student's-t and GED) for the errors. Findings – Empirical results show that temperature affects negatively the PSI 20 stock returns in Portugal. Moreover, temperature is dependent of both January and <b>trading</b> <b>month</b> effects. Stock returns were found to be positive in January and higher over the first fortnight of the month. Lower temperature in January leads to higher stock returns due to investors' aggressive risk taking. Research limitations/implications – Further research should investigate the impact of other meteorological variables (humidity, amount of sunshine) and other calendar anomalies on the course and behaviour of major international stock indices using data before and after the recent crisis. Practical implications – The findings are helpful to financial managers, investors and traders dealing with the Portuguese stock market. Originality/value – The contribution {{of this paper is}} to provide evidence on the empirical linkages between temperature and stock market returns using GARCH models. To better understand the relationship between the temperature and stock market returns, the paper also examines whether the returns are higher in winter (January effect) and during the first or second fortnight of the month (<b>trading</b> <b>month</b> effect). To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first empirical investigation on weather and stock market returns relationship for Portugal.

40|$|Master in the Electric Power IndustryMotivation Significant ex-post forward {{risk premium}} (the {{difference}} between forward and realized spot prices) {{has been found}} existing {{in most of the}} electricity markets. It is still not clear that if the forward risk premium fully represents compensation to financial market participants for bearing systematic risk, or in fact it contains information not used by market agents which indicates inefficiency in the forward markets. Hence it is very necessary and of significance to study the forward price formation, and further to discover the determinants of the ex-post risk premium associated in forward prices. Research questions The main research question is: What are the main determinants of ex-post forward risk premium in the Spanish electricity market? The sub-research questions are:  What are the characteristics of ex-post forward risk premium?  How the risk premium is related to fundamental measures of risks faced by market participates?  How do supply and demand shocks affect risk assessments and market outcomes?  What is the effect of regulatory provisions on forward market and forward risk premium?  What is the effect of speculative and hedging activities on future-spot bias?  What are the implications for the performance of electricity forward markets? Theory The thesis is based on the hedging pressure theory developed by Keynes (1930) that the future contract acts as an instrument for market agents to hedge price risk. The difference between future and expected future prices, namely the ex-ante forward risk premium, is the compensation required by the agent who is willing to bear the spot price risk. Ex-post risk premium as the difference between the future price and the realized spot price at maturity, is an unbiased estimate of the ex-ante risk premium under the assumption that agents form rational forecasts. Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002) develop an equilibrium model for electricity forward prices. Their model implies that the ex-ante forward premium is negatively related to the variance of the spot prices, but positively related to the skewness of spot prices. Determinants of forward risk premium: An empirical analysis of the Spanish electricity market ii Master in the Electric Power Industry (MEPI) 2014 - 2015 Methodology In this study, future prices for electricity monthly base-load future contracts settled on the last trading day covering delivery time from January 2010 to March 2015 in OMIP, and monthly average spot prices from OMIE were used to calculate the ex-post forward risk premium. We proposed a comprehensive multifactor propositional framework so as to discover the determinants of forward risk premium. It included fundamental influences, behavioral effects, dynamic effects, market hedging, speculative activities and liquidity, regulatory instruments, and shock effects. In addition an econometric model based regression analysis was used to quantify the influence of these determinants on forward risk premium. Results Significant positive forward risk premium is found in the Spanish forward markets. The regression results suggest that market agents follow adaptive expectation formation rather than rational expectation. Moreover, the risk premium is positively influenced by regulated auctions, margin shocks, spot price volatility, and negatively influenced by basis. Conclusion  The variance of daily spot prices during the <b>trading</b> <b>month</b> positively influences the ex-post risk premium. It indicates that there is more hedging pressure from retailers with risk aversion to spot price volatility. The spot price variance during <b>trading</b> <b>month</b> {{can be seen as the}} fundamental risk assessment by market participants who form adaptive price expectation.  Increasing margin shocks leads to lower realized spot prices, and higher risk premium. Margin shocks represent the misjudgment of future supply and demand conditions by market agents.  CESUR and OMIP call auctions increased forward prices and forward risk premium during the study period.  The average positive 10 % relative ex-post forward risk premium indicates that future markets results are largely determined by retailers.  The basis is used as a dynamic estimator of risk premium which captures the links between current spot prices and forward prices, in turn confirming that market agents follow adaptive price formation.  The residual of the regression model does not confirm normal distribution, implying that there is still information not used by the market agents to form forward prices. Hence market inefficiency cannot be ruled out still...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{nonlinear}} relationships between financial (and economic) variables within the field of financial econometrics. The thesis comprises two reviews of literatures, one on nonlinear time series models andthe other one on term structure of interest rates, and four empirical essays on financialapplications using nonlinear modelling techniques. The first empirical essay compares different model specifications of a Markov switching CIR model on the term structure of UK interest rates. We find the least restricted model provides the best in-sample estimation results. Although models with restrictive specifications may provide slightly better out-of-sample forecasts in directional movements of the yields, the economic gains seem to be small. In the second essay, we jointly model the nominal and real term structure of the UK interest rates using a three-factor essentially affine no-arbitrage term structure model. The model-implied expected inflation rates are then used in the subsequent analysis on its nonlinear relationship with the FTSE 100 index return premiums, utilizing a smooth transition vector autoregressive model. We find the model implied expected inflation rates remain below the actual inflation rates after the independence of the Bank of England in 1997, and the recent sharp decline of the expected inflation rates may lend support to the standing ground of the central bank for keeping interest rates low. The nonlinearity test on the relationship between the FTSE 100 index return premiums and the expected inflation rates shows that there exists a nonlinear adjustment on the impact from lagged expected inflation rates to current return premiums. The third essay provides us additional insight into the nature of the aggregate stock market volatilities and its relationship to the expected returns, in a Markov switching model framework, using centuries-long aggregate stock market data from six countries (Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and US). We find that the Markov switching model assuming both regime dependent mean and volatility with a 3 -regime specification is capable to captures the extreme movements of the stock market which are short-lived. The volatility feedback effect that we studied on each of these six countries shows a positive sign on anticipating a high volatility regime of the current <b>trading</b> <b>month.</b> The investigation on the coherence in regimes over time for the six countries shows different results for different pairs of countries. In the last essay, we decompose the term premium of the North American CDX investment grade index into a permanent and a stationary component using a Markov switching unobserved component model. We explain the evolution of the two components in relating them to monetary policy and stock market variables. We establish that the inversion of the CDX index term premium is induced by sudden changes in the unobserved stationary component, which represents the evolution of the fundamentals underpinning the risk neutral probability of default in the economy. We find strong evidence that the unprecedented monetary policy response from the Fed during the crisis period was effective in reducing market uncertainty and helped to steepen the term structure of the CDX index, thereby mitigating systemic risk concerns. The impact of stock market volatility on flattening the term premium was substantially more robust in the crisis period. We also show that equity returns make a significant contribution to the CDX term premium over the entire sample period. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This study {{gives an}} insight into the {{behaviour}} and performance of large speculators and large hedgers in 29 US futures markets. Using a trading determinant model and priced risk factors such as net positions and sentiment index, results suggest hedgers (speculators) exhibit significant positive feedback trading in 15 (7) markets. Information variables like the S&P 500 index dividend yield, corporate yield spread and the three months treasury bill rate were mostly unimportant in large players’ trading decisions. Hedgers had better market timing abilities than speculators in judging {{the direction of the}} market in one month. The poor market timing abilities and poor significance of positive feedback results suggest higher trading frequency intervals for speculators. Hedging pressures, which measure the presence of risk premium in futures markets, were insignificant mostly in agricultural markets. As a robust test of hedging pressures, price pressure tests found risk premium to be still significant for silver, crude oil and live cattle. The positive feedback behaviour and negative market timing abilities suggest hedgers in heating oil and Japanese yen destabilize futures prices, and points to a need to check CFTC’s (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) position limits regulation in these markets. In fact, large hedgers in these two markets {{are more likely to be}} leading behaviour, in that they have more absolute net positions than speculators. Alternatively stated, positive feedback hedgers in these two markets are more likely to lead institutions and investors to buy (sell) overpriced (underpriced) contracts, eventually leading to divergence of prices away from fundamentals. Atlhought hedgers in crude oil had significant positive feedback behaviour and negative market timing skills, they would not have much of a destabilizing effect over remaining players because the mean net positions of hedgers and speculators were not far apart. While the results are statistically significant, it is suggested these could be economically significant, in that there have been no regulation on position limits at all for hedgers compared to speculators who are imposed with strict limits from the CFTC. Further, mean equations were regressed against decomposed variables, to see how much of the futures returns are attributed to expected components of variables such as net positions, sentiment and information variables. While the expected components of variables are derived by ensuring there are enough ARMA (autoregressive and moving average) terms to make them statistically and economically reliable, the unexpected components of variables measure the residual on differences of the series from its mean. When decomposing net positions against returns, it was found expected net positions to be negatively related to hedgers’ returns in mostly agricultural markets. Speculators’ expected (unexpected) positions were less (more) significant in explaining actual returns, suggesting hedgers are more prone in setting an expected net position at the start of the <b>trading</b> <b>month</b> to determine actual returns rather than readjusting their net positions frequently all throughout the remaining days of the month. While it important to see how futures returns are determined by expected and unexpected values, it is also essential to see how volatility is affected as well. In an attempt to cover three broad types of volatility measures, idiosyncratic volatility, GARCH based volatility (variance based), and PARCH based volatility (standard deviation) are used. Net positions of hedgers (expected and unexpected) tend to have less effect on idiosyncratic volatility than speculators that tended to add to volatility, reinforcing that hedgers trading activity hardly affect the volatility in their returns. This suggest they are better informed by having a better control over their risk (volatility) measures. The GARCH model showed more reliance of news of volatility from previous month in speculators’ volatility. Hedgers’ and speculators’ volatility had a tendency to decay over time except for hedgers’ volatility in Treasury bonds and coffee, and gold and S&P 500 for speculators’ volatility. The PARCH model exhibited more negative components in explaining current volatility. Only in crude oil, heating oil and wheat (Chicago) were idiosyncratic volatility positively related to return, reinforcing the suggestion for stringent regulation in the heating oil market. Expected idiosyncratic volatility was lower (higher) for hedgers (speculators) as expected under portfolio theory. Markets where variance or standard deviation are smaller than those of speculators support the price insurance theory where hedging enables traders to insure against the risk of price fluctuations. Where variance or standard deviation of hedgers is greater than speculators, this suggest the motivation to use futures contracts not primarily to reduce risk, but by institutional characteristics of the futures exchanges like regulation ensuring liquidity. Results were also supportive that there was higher fluctuations in currency and financial markets due to the higher number of contracts traded and players present. Further, the four models (GARCH normal, GARCH t, PARCH normal and PARCH t) showed returns were leptokurtic. The PARCH model, under normal distribution, produced the best forecast of one-month return in ten markets. Standard deviation and variance for both hedgers’ and speculators’ results were mixed, explained by a desire to reduce risk or other institutional characteristics like regulation ensuring liquidity. Moreover, idiosyncratic volatility failed to accurately forecast the risk (standard deviation or variance based) that provided a good forecast of one-month return. This supports not only the superiority of ARCH based models over models that assume equally weighted average of past squared residuals, but also the presence of time varying volatility in futures prices time series. The last section of the study involved a stability and events analysis, using recursive estimation methods. The trading determinant model, mean equation model, return and risk model, trading activity model and volatility models were all found to be stable following the effect of major global economic events of the 1990 s. Models with risk being proxied as standard deviation showed more structural breaks than where variance was used. Overall, major macroeconomic events didn’t have any significant effect upon the large hedgers’ and speculators’ behaviour and performance over the last decade...|$|E
