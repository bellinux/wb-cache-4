5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
25|$|For a size comparison, a clay-sized {{particle}} is 1/1000 {{the size}} of a sand grain. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement.|$|E

25|$|Applicative order: The rightmost, {{innermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. Intuitively <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even {{when this is}} not possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> {{reversal}} of its whole style of governing, {{adherence to the}} rule of law, an end to political violence and repression, opening of the press and media space, and a cessation of all interference with citizens basic freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{changes at}} any {{location}} - The standard LZB system required that speed restrictions start at block boundaries. With CIR-ELKE speed restrictions can start at any point, {{such as at}} a turnout. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> train doesn't have to slow down as soon, increasing average speeds.|$|E

25|$|Milnacipran {{inhibits}} the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in an approximately 1:3 ratio, respectively; {{in practical}} use <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> relatively balanced action upon both neurotransmitters. Increasing both neurotransmitters concentration simultaneously works synergistically to treat both depression and fibromyalgia. Milnacipran exerts no significant actions on H1, α1, D1, D2, and mACh receptors, nor on benzodiazepine and opioid binding sites.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{restriction}} of this let {{is that the}} name f is not defined in M, since M is {{outside the scope of}} the lambda-abstraction binding f; <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> recursive function definition cannot be used as the M with let. The more advanced letrec syntactic sugar construction that allows writing recursive function definitions in that naive style instead additionally employs fixed-point combinators.|$|E
25|$|Iminoglycinuria is {{believed}} to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and inheritance requires two copies of the defective geneone from each parent. Parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.|$|E

50|$|Uke must {{attack with}} a {{strength}} and speed {{appropriate to the}} skill level of the tori; {{in the case of}} beginners, <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>an</b> attack of far less severity than would be encountered in a real-life self-defense situation.|$|R
25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation in 'damages' or money. In {{a limited}} range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.|$|E
25|$|Although twenty over cricket matches {{have existed}} {{for decades and}} remains the most popular amateur form of the game, the {{professional}} format Twenty20 cricket was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2003. It {{is a form of}} one-day cricket in which each team bats for a maximum of only 20 overs, contrasting with 50 overs for a standard one-day match. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> game can be completed in about three hours, making it more palatable for children and families than longer matches.|$|E
25|$|As stars emit {{matter with}} a stellar {{wind from the}} photosphere, the {{magnetosphere}} creates a torque on the ejected matter. This results in a transfer of angular momentum from the star to the surrounding space, causing a slowing of the stellar rotation rate. Rapidly rotating stars have a higher mass loss rate, resulting in a faster loss of momentum. As the rotation rate slows, so too does the angular deceleration. By <b>this</b> <b>means,</b> <b>a</b> star will gradually approach, but never quite reach, the state of zero rotation.|$|E
50|$|In September 2006, the Auckland {{marathon}} {{course was}} officially measured by approved measurer Bob Braid. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>an</b> athlete's {{time over the}} 2006 marathon course can be recognised to qualify for international {{events such as the}} World Championships in Athletics.|$|R

5000|$|This is not {{the case}} with Link Aggregate Control Protocol which [...] "Does not {{increase}} the bandwidth for <b>a</b> single conversation.". <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>an</b> LACP group consisting of two 1Gbit/s physical ports will have a maximum transfer rate of 1Gbit/s (minus overhead) per transfer.|$|R
25|$|Worldshops' {{aim is to}} make {{trade as}} direct and fair with the trading {{partners}} as possible. Usually, <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> producer in a developing country and consumers in industrialized countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day where a different fair trade item is featured each day.|$|E
25|$|Self-synchronization: The leading bytes and the {{continuation}} bytes {{do not share}} values (continuation bytes start with 10 while single bytes start with 0 and longer lead bytes start with 11). <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting {{in the middle of}} another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is the {{restoration}} of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.|$|E
