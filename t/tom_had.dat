5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still {{on the ground in}} some places. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{reported}} to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats {{told him that}} Ike and <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> left their livery stable and entered town while armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.|$|E
5|$|Tom awakes {{the next}} morning on his sofa. Gerri is alarmed to see him there, as he should be at work, and then gets angry that Migg was invited in. Migg emerges from the {{bathroom}} as Gerri leaves the house, and encourages Tom to call in sick. It is revealed that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> promised Migg some of his clothes, and Migg makes breakfast. Later, Migg and Tom play Risk and drink wine. Tom is concerned that Gerri has not called. When Tom heads out to buy cigarettes and wine, Migg hides Tom's mobile and deletes an answerphone message left by Tom's colleague Stevie (Hill).|$|E

5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, <b>Tom,</b> <b>had</b> left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E

5|$|Sienna grows {{feelings}} for Darren and they kiss, although Darren later reunites with Nancy after she recovers. Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying to breast feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this. Darren later finds out that Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) is his mother and disowns Jack for lying to him for years. Darren, Sienna and Oscar move out because of this. Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom. Darren finds the video camera, however, and assumes that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> been trying to film Sienna topless again leaving Darren furious with Tom. Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley of ashes on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E

500|$|A {{few moments}} later, Tom McLaury was carried {{from the corner}} of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. [...] Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> been taken. Billy was in {{considerable}} pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, [...] "They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air." [...] Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, [...] "Go away and let me die." [...] Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.|$|E

500|$|Conflicting reports {{reached the}} outside world and for a time it was feared that <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> died. In the press, Horatio was accused of {{ignoring}} warnings and allowing Aborigines to encroach on his property. The retribution was also called excessive. Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism. Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, [...] "if we had used common precaution all would have been well". It was later revealed that, prior to leaving the camp, Tom advised Horatio to be watchful of the local Aborigines, but according to Hammersley, [...] "the old man prided himself on being able to manage the blacks ... and said they would never harm him." [...] The Queensland press, still {{in the wake of the}} massacre, suggested that Wills, [...] "now a Queenslander", be approached to captain the colony's cricket team.|$|E
500|$|At around 1:30–2:00 pm, after <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> been pistol-whipped by Wyatt, Ike's 19-year-old {{younger brother}} Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They {{had heard from}} their neighbor, Ed [...] "old man" [...] Frink, that Ike had been {{stirring}} up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers. They arrived from Antelope Springs, [...] east of Tombstone, {{where they had been}} rounding up stock with their brothers and had breakfasted with Ike and Tom the day before. Both Frank and Billy were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone. Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight, so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted.|$|E
500|$|Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan {{had seen}} Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp {{and before the}} gunfight, none of the Earps had any {{way of knowing that}} <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> left his {{revolver}} at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert [...] "Chris" [...] Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>has</b> amnesia. Bart {{decides to}} frame Tom by {{shooting}} a rancher with Tom's gun.

As well as this, other people that she met in connection with <b>Tom</b> <b>have</b> no idea who she is, her friend Nina believes that Polly stopped talking to her years ago, and friends that she met through <b>Tom</b> <b>have</b> apparently never met her. She becomes frustrated, and is determined to find Tom, the man she knew and still loves.|$|R

500|$|Gellibrand entered Federal {{politics}} in the November 1925 election, at which he was elected the member for Denison on the Nationalist Party of Australia ticket. In his campaign speeches he exploited the fear of communism. As the member for Denison, he supported increased Federal funding for Tasmania, and called for improvements {{in the way the}} Australian Army trained future leaders. He was involved in the campaign for the 1926 referendum, which failed. He lost his seat in the 1928 election, and failed to regain it in the 1929 election. After that he returned to farming at Greenhills. He also bought a foreclosed [...] property near Smithton, Tasmania, called Garth, from the AMP Society, of which he was a director. On 1 August 1936, he purchased a new property, Balaclava, at Murrindindi, Victoria, not far from Yea, Victoria, where his son <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> a farm, and made his home there, selling the properties in Tasmania.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{called it}} a [...] "particularly strong" [...] episode that used all of the {{characters}} well. Fowler especially liked that although Ron and Leslie bickered throughout the episode, they still displayed a mutual respect for each other. He also said Tom's photography sessions were {{a good way to}} display Ann and Mark's deteriorating relationship. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said [...] "Summer Catalog" [...] laid the foundation for several future developments, like changes to the Andy/April and Mark/Ann relationships, but also kept the episode funny and enjoyable. Heisler said <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> the best lines of the episode. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she was saddened by the decline in Mark and Ann's relationship and the setback for the April and Andy courtship, and feared the subplot might not reach a satisfactory conclusion {{by the end of the}} season. Gallagher also said the mainplot with Leslie and the former park heads was predictable, and that guest star Michael Gross was underused.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create its personality. Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. <b>Tom</b> <b>had</b> already worked on lots of other animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E
