This ordering is central to what is usually referred to as neoclassical transport theory. This ordering is incorrect at low aspect ratio, where it can often {{be the case that}} the toroidal gyroradius is larger than the poloidal gyroradius. We calculate the correction to the particle and thermal diffusivities at low aspect ratio by comparing the diffusivities as determined by a full orbit code (which we refer to as omni-classical diffusion) with those from a gyroaveraged orbit code (neoclassical diffusion). In typical low aspect ratio devices the omni-classical diffusion can be up to 2. 5 times the calculated neoclassical value.

In particular, well-defined laboratory experiments allow one {{to study the}} dynamics of drift wave mode structures as well as 'eddies' in drift wave turbulence. In the present paper we discuss the mutual relationships between observations made in linear <b>magnetic</b> geometry, purely <b>toroidal</b> geometry and <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement.</b> The simplest structure, a saturated, nonlinear drift mode, is {{the starting point for}} a Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse transition route to chaos and weakly developed turbulence. Both spectral and phase space analysis are applied to characterize in detail the transition scenario, which is enforced due to an increased drive by the plasma equilibrium state. In addition to direct multi-probe observation, statistical approaches are most revealing for the systematic study of the spatiotemporal dynamics in fully developed drift wave turbulence. In particular, the propagation {{of large-scale}} 'eddy' structures is traced by conditional statistics methods.

These phenomena are illustrated numerically for the three-field-period heliac H- 1, and contrasted with an axisymmetric s-α tokamak model.

40|$|We {{have succeeded}} in obtaining {{magnetized}} equilibrium states with differential rotation and differential <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields. If an internal toroidal field of a proto-neutron star is wound up from the initial poloidal magnetic field by differential rotation, {{the distribution of the}} <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is determined by the profile of this differential rotation. However, the distributions of the toroidal fields in all previous magnetized equilibrium studies do not represent the magnetic winding by the differential rotation of the star. In this paper, we investigate a formulation of a differential <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field that represents the magnetic field wound up by differential rotation. We have developed two functional forms of differential toroidal fields which correspond to a v-constant and a j-constant field in analogy to differential rotations. As the degree of the differential becomes very high, the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field becomes highly localized and concentrated near the rotational axis. Such a differential <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field would suppress the low-T/|W| instability more efficiently even if the total magnetic field energy is much smaller than that of a non-differential <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field.

A new method of non-inductive startup, referred to as transient coaxial helicity injection (Transient CHI), has been developed on the Helicity Injected Torus (HIT-II) experiment and the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). In this method, plasma current is produced by discharging a capacitor bank between coaxial electrodes {{in the presence of}} toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields chosen such that the plasma rapidly expands into the chamber. When the injected current is rapidly decreased, magnetic reconnection occurs near the injection electrodes with the toroidal plasma current forming closed flux surfaces.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the turbulent fluctuations measured in a linear plasma device {{could be described as}} a superposition of uncorrelated Lorentzian pulses with a narrow distribution of durations, which would provide an explanation for the reported quasi-exponential power spectra. Here, we study the applicability of this proposal to edge fluctuations in <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> fusion plasmas. For the purpose of this analysis, we introduce a novel wavelet-based pulse detection technique that offers important advantages over existing techniques. It allows extracting the properties of individual pulses from the experimental time series, and quantifying the distribution of pulse duration and energy, as well as temporal correlations. We apply the wavelet technique to edge turbulent fluctuation data from the W 7 -AS stellarator and the JET tokamak, and find that the pulses detected in the data do not have a narrow distribution of durations and are not uncorrelated. Instead, the distributions are of the power law type, exhibiting temporal correlations over scales much longer than the typical pulse duration. These results suggest that turbulence in open and closed field line systems may be distinct and cast doubt on the proposed ubiquity of exponential power spectra in this context.

Four busbar systems feed these coils. Since the electrical terminals of the OH coils {{are located in the}} high field region of the machine, both the terminals and the feeding busbars are subjected to a high electromagnetic load, which involves severe mechanical problems. The requirement for a low stray field caused by the electrical connections has also to be taken into account. From a preliminary analysis, the most critical points of the structure revealed to be the copper-insulation interface inside the coil terminals and the bolted joints between busbars and coils. The field configuration, together with the geometry of the busbars, gives rise to a very complex load distribution, which required the use of the finite element method to perform a more precise stress analysis. A wide set of stress analyses on several possible design solutions has shown that stresses can be remarkably reduced with a careful choice of the busbar route. In the paper the basic design criteria, the analysis procedures, results and the manufacturing solution are exposed in detail...|$|E
