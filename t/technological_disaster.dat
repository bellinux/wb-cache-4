The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of Modeling Extinction, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions.

50|$|Technological crises {{are caused}} by human {{application}} of science and technology. Technological accidents inevitably occur when technology becomes complex and coupled and something goes wrong in {{the system as a}} whole (Technological breakdowns). Some technological crises occur when human error causes disruptions (Human breakdowns). People tend to assign blame for a <b>technological</b> <b>disaster</b> because technology is subject to human manipulation whereas they do not hold anyone responsible for natural disaster. When an accident creates significant environmental damage, the crisis is categorized as megadamage. Samples include software failures, industrial accidents, and oil spills.|$|E

All this occurred {{because there was a}} technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health as the area had caused nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,” and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone.

50|$|Published in 1998, {{this paper}} was {{prepared}} as a background paper for the International Seminar on the Quality of Life and Environmental Risks in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in October 1996. This paper discusses the important factors of preparing for and managing disaster occasions. In order to assess in the preparedness of planning for and the managing of disasters, the paper answers the following question: What is good planning and managing? The answer has been determined from results of the empirical research undertaken by social and behavioral scientists over a 40-year period. Since there are no significant behavioral differences between natural and <b>technological</b> <b>disaster,</b> {{there will be no}} distinction in the discussion of preparedness for them. First, the paper discusses the ten general principles of good disaster planning to a great extent as these are the basis for evaluating a plan as good or bad. These evaluations can be made prior to any disaster occurring. This section is followed with the ten general principles of disaster managing since preparedness has a different criterion than management. Good management does not automatically stem from good planning since there is only a partial correlation between the two processes. This paper concludes with noting that majority of the research studies used were done in developed countries rather than developing ones. In order to address these differences, the paper discusses some possible disaster-related differences between the two kinds of social systems. The conclusion states that the 20 principles derived mostly from studies in developed societies are in applicable to developing countries in varying degrees.|$|E
