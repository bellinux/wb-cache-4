The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced {{to move into a}} trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to {{put food on the table}} for her daughters.

500|$|More {{significant}} is {{the connection between}} the women in the novel and the women in Balzac's life. Some critics have noted important similarities between Valentin's efforts to win the heart of Foedora and Balzac's infatuation with Olympe Pélissier. A scene in which Valentin hides in Foedora's bedroom <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>her</b> undress is said to come from a similar situation wherein Balzac secretly observed Pélissier. It's probable that Pélissier was not the model for Foedora, however, since she accepted Balzac's advances and wrote him friendly letters; Foedora, by contrast, declares herself outside the reach of any interested lover. Critics agree that the [...] "Woman without a Heart" [...] described in the novel is a composite of other women Balzac knew. The character of Pauline, meanwhile, was likely influenced by another of Balzac's mistresses, Laure de Berny.|$|E
