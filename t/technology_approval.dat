The investigation conformed to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes [15]. Anaesthetised sheep (18 -month-old ewes, weighing 40 to 45  kg) were commenced on VV ECMO via access (22  F) and return (19  F) cannulae inserted in their capacious right internal jugular vein (IJV). Anaesthesia was induced using intravenous midazolam (0.5  mg/kg) and alfaxalone (3  mg/kg). No muscle relaxants were used. Anaesthesia was maintained with infusions of alfaxalone (4 to 6  mg/kg/h), midazolam (0.25 to 0.5  mg/kg/h), and ketamine (3 to 5  mg/kg/h). An intravenous bolus of buprenorphine 0.01  mg/kg was given for analgesia and subsequently every 6  h.

This study investigates how <b>Technology</b> <b>Approval</b> Group (TAG) may bridge an identified funding gap. TAG is a communication tool enabling investors that traditionally would not invest that early in an innovation to feel confident in injecting VC into developing CTFs. In the study, challenges facing the investors include high levels of risk and small investment sums required. Additional characteristics that affect the funding process are the market size, the communication platforms and the political climate. A successful implementation of TAG in the water sector, in the UK, provided inspiration for expanding the use to other sectors and geographical markets where new challenges were identified.

40|$|Small {{drinking}} water systems face different challenges than large {{drinking water}} systems. Innovative technologies can provide cost and reliability benefits to small systems, but new technologies are not frequently considered. One important {{barrier to the}} implementation of new technologies is obtaining state drinking water agency approval. To identify specific state regulatory barriers, a survey including sixteen questions was sent to the 49 state agencies. The survey included questions regarding their acceptance programs, experiences with new technologies, barriers, data needs for <b>technology</b> <b>approval,</b> and interest in a shared approach for acceptance of new technologies. The survey was sent in 2015 and received an 82 % response rate. The survey confirmed that new technologies are rarely considered for implementation in small systems. Key barriers encountered by states include an overall lack of state agency time, lack of training for their staff, lack of data from vendors (including appropriate pilot data), and lack of independent verification/certification. Regulatory and statute issues were found to be less important barriers. To overcome barriers, states are primarily interested in performance data from pilot studies, and the results of this survey show that states are willing to collaborate by sharing data. Since there is an interest in information sharing, {{the next step is to}} identify how to share information nationwide, according to this survey, past EPA programs like the Arsenic Demonstration Program were effective, so perhaps the arsenic program could be used as a template for the new information sharing program.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMissing in DHS' current gap and vulnerability analysis approach to Red Teaming is {{the employment of}} broader decision support Red Teaming-which would provide a strategic assessment tool, assisting the organization in overcoming group thinking {{and a lack of}} organizational creativity, while avoiding mirror-imaging. DHS, by broadening its use of Red Teaming, will improve its decisionmaking processes across all levels of homeland security. This research uses a selected case study identifying and challenging assumptions inherent within TSA's security system, analyzing the problem using an alternative model, and looking at the problem from different perspectives. Combined with evidence and analysis from historical examples, this effort is designed to determine whether decision makers can benefit from Red Teams and Red Team fundamental concepts, and whether these concepts will be effective in assisting DHS and its partners in making better decisions. America's Homeland Security System is hampered by bureaucratic challenges. The U. S. government must dramatically re-orient itself. America needs to redefine its homeland security approach into a flexible adaptive system. Understanding the U. S. layers of security, and how they interact to defeat the terrorist threat, is as critical as understanding "Red"-what our enemies are doing. Trained Red Teams apply creative thinking, and Red Team fundamentals, challenge the organization's assumptions, provide alternative analysis to the organization's plans, and provide the decision maker with alternative perspectives on the current operating environment. Education on the Red Team Fundamentals should be implemented as mandatory for all homeland security leaders. DHS should: implement decision support Red Teams as part of its force structure; implement joint enterprise Red Teams between its own agencies and facilitate joint enterprise Red Teams between DHS and other security agencies, entities and partners; and implement Red Team integration into the Homeland Security <b>technology</b> <b>approval</b> process.

40|$|This Thesis {{covers the}} {{development}} of an alternative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation technology that has become known as the Ground-based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS). GNSS augmentation technologies in support of aviation have largely been developed by countries with large economies such as the USA and members of the European Union. These technologies have focussed on solutions to the specific problems of the host nations, based on the demographics, political and economic factors relevant to them. Outside these countries, the role of GNSS augmentation has largely been ignored, specifically when considering wide area augmentation utilising Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). SBAS technologies are expensive, and cannot be justified for nations like Australia with {{a relatively small number of}} aircraft, operated in a focussed geographic area. Utilising SBAS services provided by another country introduces cultural, legal and institutional issues that are not always easily addressed. GRAS was derived to provide a cost-effective wide area augmentation capability to nations that lacked the economic ability to field SBAS technologies. This work covers the evolution of the GRAS concept, the construction and testing of the GRAS test bed and its associated test avionics, as well as {{the development of}} standards needed to support GRAS as an internationally accepted aviation standard. The major outcome from this work was the confirmation that GRAS could meet the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) standards for Approaches with Vertical Guidance Level 2 (APV-II) as well as all less demanding modes of flight. Results from numerous ground and flight tests conducted under this research program have been reviewed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) GNSS Panel (GNSSP), and been instrumental in the development and validation of Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) which promulgate how ICAO standardised systems should perform. The final component of this work describes the project management and <b>technology</b> <b>approval</b> processes needed to get an internationally standardised system into operational use, and the particular problems that a small country like Australia has in progressing these tasks on the World stage...|$|E
40|$|As {{facility}} demolition and remediation {{continued at}} the DOE Ashtabula Environmental Management Project (AEMP), a DOE closure site located in Ashtabula, OH, {{the quantity of}} mixed waste increased by approximately twenty-fold from the original Site Treatment Plan estimates to over 567 m 3 (20, 000 cubic feet). Also, {{a greater variety of}} low-level mixed waste (MW) was identified that was suitable for alternate debris treatment like macroencapsulation (MACRO) instead of traditional shredding, stabilization, and solidification to improve the overall safety and cost-effectiveness. Macroencapsulation is required for lead and authorized for hazardous debris under the alternate debris treatment standards per 40 CFR 268. 45. Several polymer encapsulation processes were being explored, developed, and deployed in the mid- 1990 's by various groups including the DOE Mixed Waste Focus Area, DOE EM- 50 Office of Science and Technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory, DOE Macro Working Group, DOE-Albuquerque Mixed Waste/Mobile Treatment Unit, and Envirocare of Utah, Inc. As a result, technically-proven macroencapsulation and microencapsulation processes using extruded polyethylene beads were verified as being technically acceptable for waste treatment to RCRA standards. The AEMP had a variety of waste forms where technically-proven systems were needed to perform on-site treatment of challenging mixed wastes (MW) from production operations (i. e. HEPA filters, barium salt contaminated steel) containing high concentrations of enriched uranium, graphite, salts, and RCRA metals. The AEMP continued with a technology development and deployment process to license, permit, install, and safely operate two proven polymer encapsulation systems for both RCRA microencapsulation and RCRA macroencapsulation using surplus DOE equipment from Rocky Flats to establish cost-effective mobile treatment capability. The AEMP treated approximately 16 m 3 (= 579 cf) of challenging mixed wastes onsite at approximately 50 wt% waste loading using polymer microencapsulation and macroencapsulation systems to isolate the hazards from the general public. These wastes were then profiled and buried in fifty-seven (57) containers containing approximately 33 m 3 (1, 194 cf) of LDR-compliant wastes at NTS and Envirocare of Utah, Inc. However, this paper summarizes only the MACRO <b>technology</b> <b>approval,</b> waste inspection/treatment/certification process, and technology transfer as deployed at AEMP and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). It describes only the sequences associated with optimizing the process for the polymer MACRO system to meet overall DOE waste management needs. AEMP performed MACRO on 4 m 3 (139 cf) of RCRA debris before the system was shut down. The shut down occurred due to new project direction, funding availability, and alternate offsite treatment capabilities at TSCAI and/or commercial facilities for the balance of the mixed wastes...|$|E

These organisations have specific functions but also have systemic value by fostering connectivity and by creating points of contact among the different institutional spheres (Howells 2006). Intermediary actors stimulate the emergence of ‘boundary objects’ (Gieryn 1983; Gieryn 1999), which are social artefacts that lie between the boundaries of different social worlds allowing for a more effective communication between groups with divergent perspectives (Star 1989). Boundary objects have sometimes been associated with non-human actors with agency {{from the perspective of}} the ANT (Fleischmann 2006). As examples, competition of ideas, incubation services, business plans and patents are evident boundary objects commonly used in the connection between the worlds of science and industry.|$|R
