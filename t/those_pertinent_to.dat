40|$|This {{investigation}} examines published {{results of}} traditional diffusion experiments on ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin {{to determine the}} extent to which assumed concentration independence of the translational diffusion coefficient is a reasonable approximation in the analysis of boundary spreading in sedimentation velocity experiments on proteins.

Instead, the results are better described by the relatively minor concentration dependence predicted by considering solution viscosity to be an additional source of D–c dependence. Inasmuch as the predicted variation in D for solutions with concentrations below 10 mg mL- 1 is within the uncertainty of experimental estimates, these findings support use of the approximate solution of the Lamm equation developed by Fujita for the quantitative analysis of boundary spreading in sedimentation velocity experiments on proteins...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{qualitative}} study sets {{to fill a}} gap in knowledge by exploring the health seeking behaviour of rural women living in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt). The existing literature on the oPt has so far focused on unravelling the country’s epidemiological and health system profile, but has largely neglected the assessment of factors shaping people’s decisions on health care use. Methods: Based on a conceptual framework rooted in the Anderson behavioural model, we conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with purposely selected women and seven key informant interviews in three purposely selected villages in Ramallah district. Results: Our findings indicate that women delay seeking professional care, use self-prescribed medications and home treatment, and do not use preventive and educational health services. Their health seeking behaviour {{is the result of the}} interplay of several factors: their gendered socio-cultural role; their health beliefs; financial affordability and geographical accessibility; their perceptions of the quality of care; and their perceived health needs.
