The brigade mobilized in October of that year and trained in infantry techniques at army posts in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The 39th Infantry Brigade was also alerted for deployment during this time and deployed to Iraq in late 2007.

The brigade returned to the United States in October 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 127th and 630th Military Police Companies began {{serving in}} Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom II in mid-2007. The 127th Company served in Iskandariyah, on patrol {{operations}} with local police. In November 2007 the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the brigade and the 793rd Military Police Battalion deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III. The brigade replaced the 89th Military Police Brigade which was assigned there previously. The transition ceremony for this command was held on 30 October as 100 soldiers from the brigade's headquarters {{took charge of the}} 89th's area of responsibility. They deployed to the Baghdad area, and took responsibility for the training of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Police.</b> The brigade is supporting Iraqi police logistics, personnel management, maintenance, budget, operations, training, leadership and judicial integration. Other training for Police units included proper search of vehicles, providing medical assistance to Iraqi civilians, as well as expanding the number of Iraqi police and improving their training overall. In theater, the brigade commanded over 5,000 soldiers. Units that the Brigade assumed control of included the 153rd Military Police Company of the Delaware Army National Guard and the 223rd Military Police Company of the Kentucky Army National Guard. The brigade worked with the 35th Engineer Brigade to finish construction on the Furat Training Facility, the primary training facility for thousands of Iraqi police. The project was completed in February 2008. In August 2008, the brigade began facilitating the transition for the 8th Military Police Brigade, which was set to replace the 18th MP Brigade when its 15-month tour of duty ended. The brigade cased its colors on 2 December 2008 and began redeploying back to its home bases. The 18th MP brigade trained 20,000 Iraqi police during its deployment, and lost 15 soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The interpreter, Sergeant (Sgt) Simon Hamilton-Jewell, Corporal (Cpl) Russ Aston and Lance {{corporal}} (LCpl) Ben Hyde {{moved off}} {{to the police station}} leaving Corporal Paul Long, Corporal Simon Miller and Lance corporal Thomas Keys to stay behind with the vehicles, weapons and body armour. Whilst the RMPs were talking in the police station, they heard the gunfire and went outside to investigate. When a crowd had formed and some of them were firing into the air, Sergeant Hamilton-Jewell ordered the Land Rovers into the compound. At this point, some of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Police</b> left, promising {{to find out what was}} going on, but it was believed that they were planning an escape. The crowd swelled to between 400 and 600 people then advanced upon the police station after finding out that British soldiers were there. At this time, the Ops Room at Abu Naji were being informed that the six RMPs might still be in Majar al-Kabir by their chain of command. As there had been no communication with the six RMPs, it could not be definitely asserted as to where they were.|$|E
50|$|Camp Dublin {{was part}} of the Victory Base Complex, a huge US cluster of {{military}} installations outside Baghdad (Iraq).

25|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the attack, one of the Land Rovers was set on fire and another was driven away. One of the RMPs, Cpl Miller was wounded by small arms fire as they ran for cover inside the police station. When the {{situation}} deteriorated even further, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>police</b> left the compound through some open windows at the back and in doing so, encouraged the six British policeman to escape too. The Iraqi policemen feared that they would be shot for being traitors and so decided to leave, but the RMPs decided the best policy was to stay behind and defend their position whilst awaiting help. They asked the Iraqis for a radio before they left, but the Iraqi policeman did not have one to give them. The area around Majar al-Kabir is very flat and as a result, HF and VHF radios don't work very well; even within close range, there are dead zones where the signal cannot be accessed. The Paratroopers had PRRs (Personal Role Radios), an Iridium satellite phone and a VHF radio. All the RMPs had was a selection of radios in their Land Rovers.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{said the}} {{incident}} that had affected her the most was when 15 detainees had been arrested by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing anti-Iraqi literature. She {{was asked by the}} Army to find out who the [...] "bad guys" [...] were, and discovered that the detainees had followed what Manning said was a corruption trail within the Iraqi cabinet. She reported this to her commanding officer, but said [...] "he didn't want to hear any of it"; she said the officer told her to help <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>police</b> find more detainees. Manning said it made her realize, [...] "i was actively involved in something that i was completely against..." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year in August 2007, the battalion made its second Iraq deployment, {{this time to}} the Fallujah area where they served under the Regimental Combat Team 6 during the closing phases of Operation Alljah. Their mission was to complete the Clear Hold Build operation {{in the areas of}} Karmah and Zaidon which the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines had begun two months earlier. [...] Karmah had become an important insurgent stronghold due its proximity both Baghdad and Fallujah. [...] Unlike other cities, Karmah had no definable perimeter to hold, making it easy for outsiders to access. [...] In addition, as insurgents were pushed out of Baghdad by other offensives they found it easy to flee to Karmah. [...] In early September, Kilo Company moved into a cluster of villages northeast of Karmah that was the last major insurgent staging ground in Anbar. The insurgents fled without firing a shot. For the first few months the Marines took small-arms and mortar fire nightly. A 20-minute attack on 5 October against <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Police</b> station in Karmah was repulsed by Jim Lanham, now a First Sergeant. By late 2007 the Marines frequently found themselves mediating between sheiks, assisting locals with reconstruction projects, and mentoring <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>police</b> units in the area. One company commander, Captain Quintin Jones, observed that, [...] "On one end I'm fighting, and on the other end I'm disputing between tribal leaders. The other part (is) trying to stimulate the economy. So, it's a three-block war here and it's very, very dynamic." [...] The battalion spent more than $1 million on Karmah, including a city council and a medical clinic. On 1 December, the battalion staged an elaborate reopening of [...] "Victory Circle", or [...] "The Lollipop", the marketplace in the center of Karmah which had earlier been the scene of fierce fighting between Marines and insurgents. In February 2008 the battalion rotated back to the United States without suffering a single casualty.|$|E

50|$|According to Stratfor, as of 2004 two Zeravani {{divisions}} (totaling 30,000 troops) {{were established}} in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Federal <b>Police.</b> In 2011, the Zeravani strenght was of 47,000, while as of 2017, Zeravani strenght is of 51,000; among these, there are several Iraqi Christians.|$|R
500|$|As the 1st Brigade {{pushed into}} Ramadi, it began aggressively courting the local tribes for police recruits. This was {{critical}} because, according to Colonel MacFarland, [...] "without their help, {{we would not}} be able to recruit enough police to take back the entire city." [...] After the Americans promised the tribal leaders in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city, the tribes began sending men into the police force. The number of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 a month before June 2006 to 300 a month by July. AQI tried to blunt police recruitment by attacking one of the new Ramadi police stations with a car bomb on 21 August, killing three Iraqi police. They simultaneously assassinated the Sunni sheikh of the Abu Ali Jassim tribe, who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Police.</b> The AQI fighters hid the body instead of leaving it for the tribe, violating Islam's funeral rites and angering the tribe. This was one of the catalysts for what became a tribal revolt against AQI. According to David Kilcullen, who would later serve as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to General Petraeus, the revolt began after AQI killed a sheikh over his refusal to give his daughters to them in marriage.|$|E
