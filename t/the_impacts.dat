5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} using the multiobjective {{function}} as the optimization objective is to increase <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> energy and frequency while decreasing the pressure pulsation amplitude of the supply and return lines. The optimization conditions were a supply flow of 40  lpm and a relief valve set pressure of 210  bar. Under these conditions, the objectives were to improve the supply and return line pulsation (including <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> frequency) by 15  % and <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> energy by 5  % during optimization. A lower objective value was used for <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> energy owing to the durability of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> piston. If <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> energy is increased to a much higher value than those used in existing cases, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> piston is likely to fracture; thus, its material should also be reviewed.

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption.

Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> of consumption.
