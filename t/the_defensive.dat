5|$|Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> {{qualities of}} Castle Rising {{have since been}} {{extensively}} debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E

Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>defensive</b> line (DL) {{consists}} of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT).

5|$|Following the defeat, the Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, {{ordered the}} Supreme Army Command {{to conduct a}} court of enquiry into <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> {{collapse}} of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack. The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> system {{was a series of}} unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result of the inquiry, Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> line against Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J.
