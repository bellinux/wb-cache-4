40|$|This paper {{examines}} the commonly held {{view that the}} Census Bureau's monthly series for residential building permits issued is a leading indicator of the series for private housing starts. A close study of the residential building permits and housing starts series shows that on a quarterly basis the series are coincident, with cyclical peaks and <b>troughts</b> in the seasonally adjusted data occurring in the same period. On the monthly basis for the period 1960 through 1976, the peaks and troughs in the building permits series have usually followed those in the housing starts series. Also, evidence presented in the paper shows that monthly changes in the residential building permits series are not highly correlated with changes in the housing starts series one to five months in the future. Finally, the analysis suggests that changes in the backlog of unused residential building permits are not indicative of future changes {{in the rate of}} housing starts. The major implication of these results is that permits data offer little or no information about future month-to-month changes in the rate of housing starts. However, because the building permits series is less irregular than the housing starts series and the cyclical movements of the series are basically the same, permits data can be used to identify irregular monthly movements in the starts series.

40|$|The Transantarctic Mountains inland of Terra Nova Bay exhibit {{four major}} landsapces. 1) The first type {{consists}} of deep troughs propagated inland by headward cutting. The lower portions of these troughs form ice-covered fjords, where present-day grounding lines extend inland beneath outlet glaciers. 2) Well-developed alpine glacial topography (with cirques, ridges, horns, and spurs) characterizes the region. Alpine topography has propagated {{from the deep}} troughs into the intervening mountain blocks. This morphology can locally be very old and reflects a different-from-present climatic regime. 3) Relict summit mesas occur in the high central mountain ranges between troughs. 4) The fourth type of morphology features undulating coastal piedmonts that are tilted seaward. The process of inland erosion by outlet glacier <b>troughts</b> and adjacent alpine topography has left isolated nearly intact remnants of the original topography. Trimlines superimposed on the alpine and outlet-trough topography mark the maximum possible expansion of the northern Victoria Land ice cover since erosion of the alpine topography. There is no definitive evidence that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet overrode northern Victoria Land nunataks or mountains. High-elevation striations in the Eisenhower Range {{seem to have been}} carved during Terra Nova glaciation. If so, local mesa ice caps and mountain glaciers expanded to feed the Terra Nova piedmont glacier during late Wisconsin time, unlike the situation farther south where alpine glacier termini in the Dry Valleys were less extensive than now during late Wisconsin time...|$|R
40|$|Epitaxially TiO 2 {{films were}} {{prepared}} by Ti vapor deposition onto Re(10 - 10) and Re(0001) surfaces at elevated temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere. Titania films grown on Re(10 - 10) exhibit the (2 x 1) reconstructed (011) -rutile surface [10, 12, 79]. The growth of titania onto Re(0001) {{was followed by}} means of XPS, LEIS and LEED. This work shows that rutile films grown on Re(0001) are (110) oriented. The surface unit cell vectors of a= 3. 2 ± 0. 2 Å und b = 6. 5 ± 0. 2 Å were determined by LEED. Titania grows {{in the form of}} nanoparticles as indicated by running LEED reflexes, onto a closed first layer of TiO 2. The very first TiO 2 layer almost wets the rhenium surface and can be explained by two superimposed hexagonal nets with lattice vectors of a 1 = 2. 76 Å substrate (Re) and a 2 = 3. 0 Å (adsorbed phase), respectivly, giving raise to a Moiré pattern. The TiO 2 (110) surface has been studied extensively in the past. We were, therefore, more interested in the rutile (011) -(2 x 1) orientation and its interaction with gold nanoparticles. Accordingly, gold was adsorbed at room temperature onto the titania model catalyst surface and studied by means of AES, LEED, STM and TPD. From measured TD spectra we could estimate the desorption energies within an accuracy limit of approx. 10 %. The desorption energy for Au on these Titania-films amounts to 325 ± 10 kJ/mol, considerably lower than the heat of sublimation of Au. The fairly high sample temperatures (T > 1200 K) reqiured for gold desorption cause also part of the Titaniumdioxide lattice oxygen to desorb, while a substanial desorption of Ti atoms could not be recorded, although there definitely occurs also a loss of Ti atoms as monitored by AES experiments. We, therefore, assume that Ti toms diffuse into the bulk of the Re substrate. Also a part of the O atoms may be spilled over the Re surface. This is the reason why we studied also the interaction between gold and the well-known [(1 x 3) 2 O] phase of the Re(10 - 10) surface. Accordingly, we present TPD, AES, STM and LEED data of the Au/(1 x 3) 2 O/Re(10 - 10) system. If gold is vapor deposited onto the (1 x 3) 2 O/Re(10 - 10) surface at room temperature, it grows via the Volmer-Weber growth mode. At high coverages the Au clusters are randomly distributed over the surface. However, annealing this disordered layer at elevated temperatures gives the Au sufficient mobility to agglomerate to cylindrical shape aggregats that are fairly well oriented parallel to the <b>troughts</b> of the Re(10 - 10) surface. Gold thermal desorption spectra exhibit two desorption states,which resemble very much the spectra obtained from the clean Re(10 - 10) surface both in the temperature position of the peak maxima and the overall shape of the TD curves. However, a major and surprising difference appears for the spectra taken from the oxygen covered Re surface in that the sequence of the filling of the two Au states is reversed: The Au multilayer state is populated at small coverages, only at larger depositions the Au monolayer state becomes filled. During the desorption process not only gold but also oxygen leaves the surface, the latter at considerably lower temperatures: Oxygen desorption starts around 800 K whereas Au desorption does not set in until 1100 K. It is, therefore, possible that gold atoms move prior to desorption to adsorption sites of the Re surface that were initially blocked by oxygen. This assumption is corroborated by STM studies which show that Au diffusion gains importance around 800 K sample temperature...|$|R
