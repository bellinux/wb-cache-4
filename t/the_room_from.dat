5|$|The {{other key}} room was the Cabinet Room. Until {{the opening of}} the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's war cabinet met at the War Rooms only once, in October 1939. Following Winston Churchill's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister, Churchill visited the Cabinet Room in May 1940 and declared: 'This is <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> which I will direct the war'. In total 115 Cabinet meetings were held at the Cabinet War Rooms, the last on 28 March 1945, when the German V-weapon bombing campaign came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers â€” when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E

25|$|Until the 19th century, in an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats {{most often}} faced the Torah Ark. In a Sephardi synagogue, seats were usually {{arranged}} {{around the perimeter}} of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.|$|E
25|$|St. Paul's Chapel in New York City {{has a large}} oil {{painting}} of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, {{not long after the}} Congress of the Confederation began meeting in nearby Federal Hall. The painting hangs over Washington's pew, across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> a painting of the arms of New York over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle, though, instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has a gold chain border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown.|$|E

500|$|From {{the main}} entrance, one enters the {{sanctuary}} at the southwest corner. [...] The room is rectangular, with a floor that slopes downward; an aisle follows this downward slope {{from the southwest}} entrance to the altar platform at the northeast corner. [...] On either side of this aisle, curved oak pews run diagonally across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> southeast to northwest. [...] An Estey pipe organ stands {{on the north side}} of the altar platform; along the north wall is a small platform for the choir. [...] A doorway at the northeast corner, behind the organ, leads to a small pastor's study.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Yurovsky Note" [...] further {{reported}} {{that once the}} thick smoke that had filled <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, {{it was discovered that}} the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of [...] "armor" [...] against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, {{one or more of the}} girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky.|$|E
500|$|The {{room on the}} {{opposite}} side of the Clifton Maybank corridor from the Great Hall was originally two rooms comprising the [...] "pannetry" [...] (sic) and [...] "buttery." [...] In a large household the buttery and [...] "pannetry" [...] were part of the offices pertaining to the kitchen, and as at Montacute they were generally close to the Great Hall. The buttery was traditionally the place from which the yeoman of the buttery served beer and candles to those lower members of the household not entitled to drink wine. Montacute's buttery is typical, as it had a staircase to the beer cellar below. The [...] "pannetry" [...] was <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> which the yeoman of the pantry served bread. By the time of Montacute's completion, upper servants often dined and entertained visiting servants in the pantry. This layout was a medieval concept and later, as custom dictated that servants withdraw from the principal areas of the house, these rooms became used by the family as reception and private dining rooms. Eventually, in the early 20th century, Lord Curzon amalgamated the two rooms to create the grand, and socially necessary, dining room, which Montacute had lacked since the Great Chamber had been abandoned more than 100 years earlier.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..." [...] Cartwright said of it: ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{volley of}} gunfire killed the Tsar, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded the family's {{doctor and the}} empress' maidservant. Maria tried to escape through the doors {{at the rear of}} the room, which led to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise as she rattled the doors {{attracted}} the attention of the drunken military commissar Peter Ermakov. [...] A heavy layer of smoke had accumulated in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> the gunfire and from plaster dust released from the walls by errant bullets, and the gunmen could see only the lower bodies of those who were still alive. [...] Ermakov fired at Maria, and his bullet struck her in the thigh. She fell to the floor with Anastasia and Demidova and lay there moaning. [...] The assassins then left the room for several minutes to let the haze clear, and when they returned they killed Dr Botkin, Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. [...] Ermakov then turned on the wounded Maria and Anastasia, who was still unharmed. He struggled with Maria and tried to stab her with a bayonet. [...] The jewels sewn into her clothes protected her, and he said he finally shot her in the head. [...] But the skull that is almost certainly Maria's has no bullet wound. [...] Perhaps the drunken Ermakov inflicted a scalp wound, knocking her unconscious and producing a considerable flow of blood, leading Ermakov to think he had killed her. [...] He then struggled with Anastasia, whom he also claimed he shot in the head. [...] As the bodies were being removed from the house, Maria regained consciousness and screamed. Ermakov tried to stab her again but failed, and struck her in the face until she was silent. [...] The facial area of Maria's skull was indeed destroyed, but Yurovsky wrote that the victims' faces were shattered with rifle butts at the burial site. [...] Though Maria unquestionably died with her family, the exact cause of her death remains a mystery.|$|E
2500|$|When {{women were}} {{integrated}} into VPI, {{it was the}} first and only women's dormitory and was built on what was then {{the far corner of the}} campus near several livestock barns used by the College of Agriculture that once stood near where Harper Hall now stands. When Hillcrest opened in 1940 it was promptly dubbed the [...] "skirt barn" [...] by VPI cadets. One of the Honors offices on the first floor used to be a [...] "courting room" [...] when Hillcrest Hall was the women's dormitory. Because visitation was not permitted in the residence hall, and women were not allowed to leave campus on dates, courting took place in this room. Young men would enter <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> one door and the young ladies would enter <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> another.

2500|$|The group's alibi {{of playing}} bridge all evening is ruined when the Inspector notices a playing card {{on the floor}} across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> the bridge table. A full deck of cards is needed to {{properly}} play bridge. Therefore, the Inspector knows the group {{could not have been}} playing several consecutive hands of bridge that evening. This is similar to an attempted alibi in the short story [...] "King of Clubs," [...] which appears in 'Poirot's Early Cases'. A family claims that they have been playing bridge all night and therefore cannot be involved in a murder that has occurred in their neighbour's house. Poirot sees through this lie after he discovers a card (the King of Clubs) is missing from the pack on the table. This discovery proves the family's alibi of playing bridge was false and they have lied about their whereabouts that evening.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{shots of the}} library and a book called [...] "The Story of Us". Swift narrates the story while {{standing}} between two bookshelves, sitting on a desk and lying across a table (and occasionally lying on top of [...] "The Story of Us") {{with a stack of}} books next to her, as we see scenes flashing back and forth between her and her ex-boyfriend, students in the library, some library staff, and her band playing the song. The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>from</b> her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E
