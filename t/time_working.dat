40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patters across 22 European countries. The focu was on three questions: how much mothers prefer to work, how much they {{actually}} work, and to what degree their preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are (in) consistent with each other. The focus was on cross-national differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, comparison of mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> to that of childless women and fathers, as well as on individual- and country-level factors that explain the variation between them. In the theoretical background, the departure point was an integrative theoretical approach where the assumption is that there are various kinds of explanations for the differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns – namely structural, cultural and institutional –, and that these factors are laid in two levels: individual- and country-levels. Data were extracted from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2010 / 2011. The results showed that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, both preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> varied across European countries. Four clusters were formed to illustrate the differences. In the full-time pattern, full-time work was the most important form of work, leaving all other <b>working</b> <b>time</b> forms marginal. The full-time pattern was perceived in terms of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times</b> in Bulgaria and Portugal. In polarised pattern countries, full-time work was also important, but it was accompanied by a large share of mothers not working at all. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> many Eastern and Southern European countries followed it whereas in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> it included all Eastern and Southern European countries as well as Finland. The combination pattern was characterised by the importance of long part-time hours and full-time work. It was the preferred <b>working</b> <b>time</b> pattern in the Nordic countries, France, Slovenia, and Spain, but Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, and Sweden followed it in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The fourth cluster that described mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was called the part-time pattern, and it was illustrated by the prevalence of short and long part-time work. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> it was followed in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Besides Belgium, the part-time pattern was followed in the same countries in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The consistency between preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was rather strong in a majority of countries. However, six countries fell under different <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns when preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> were compared. Comparison of working mothers’, childless women’s, and fathers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> showed that differences between these groups were surprisingly small. It was only in part-time pattern countries that working mothers worked significantly shorter hours than working childless women and fathers. Results therefore revealed that when mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are under study, an important question regarding the population examined is whether it consists of all mothers or only working mothers. Results moreover supported the use of the integrative theoretical approach when studying mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns. Results indicate that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns in all countries are shaped by various opportunities and constraints, which are comprised of structural, cultural, institutional, and individual-level factors.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011), the author scrutinizes the {{relations}} between women 4 s and men 4 s flexibility and autonomy in <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and two central work outcomes: overtime and income. Previously, research on flexibility and autonomy in <b>working</b> <b>time</b> mostly applied crosssectional data ignoring individuals self-selection into jobs. Furthermore, the association between flexibility and autonomy in <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and income has generally been neglected. Extending this literature, fixedeffects models show that flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy are associated with an increase of overtime and income - but only for men. Whereas women in fulltime positions also increase their <b>time</b> investment with <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy and employeeoriented flexibility to a similar extent, they do not receive similar financial rewards. These results point to gendered {{costs and benefits of}} <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy. Working time autonomy in particular is a crucial factor that reinforces gender inequality at the workplace and adds to the relatively high gender pay gap in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{labor market}} is {{characterized}} by flexibility. This applies to organizations, forms of employment and <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is such an adaptation and the main subject of this essay. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the conditions that underpin unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> in relation to the Swedish legislation and to EU legislation. The intention has been to investigate the work environment impacts of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> and what differences there are from a gender perspective. The conclusion is that workers who enter into agreements for unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> have significantly different terms from traditional workers. Workers with unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> are exempted from the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> law and so even the provided safety net. A frequent part in agreements of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> also means that the employee agrees to an elimination of compensation for overtime work. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is appropriate for workers who have working tasks that they can adjust to their <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Workers with controlled working tasks have not the same opportunity, which increases the risk of perceived ill health. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is therefore not suitable for all forms of employment. More scientific research is needed in this area, but based on the available scientific research, there are indications to suggest that women are overrepresented among those occupations. It would then also mean that womenare at greater risk of ill health than men...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Working {{time is a}} {{recurrent}} topic of study because the nature of work, its content, {{the conditions under which}} it is performed and the labour market itself keep changing. These changes have an impact on <b>working</b> <b>time</b> duration and the way <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is organised. One of the manifest results is the erosion of a clear demarcation between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and non-working time – the work and private sphere.
