5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grade I CashCall Futurity at {{a mile and}} one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E

5|$|Born near Glasgow, Reid {{worked a}} number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E
5|$|Despite the one-sided {{national}} loss in 1984, Ferraro {{was still}} viewed as {{someone with a}} bright political future. Many expected her <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1986 United States Senate election in New York against first-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato, and during 1985 she did Upstate New York groundwork towards that end. A Senate candidacy had been her original plan for her career, before she was named to Mondale's ticket. But in , {{she said she would}} not run, due to an ongoing U.S. Justice Department probe on her and her husband's finances stemming from the 1984 campaign revelations.|$|E

The ambition <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a Liechtenstein driver, Manfred Schurti. These plans only resulted in one of Royale's F2 cars being built before the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, left the company.|$|E
5|$|He ran in {{the primary}} {{elections}} of the Justicialist Party (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became {{the new president of}} Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. Not seeing any chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Barkley {{announced}} that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2014 election cycle, but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show. In 2010, he confirmed that he was not running in 2014. In 2016, Barkley once more turned Republican, when he endorsed John Kasich for the office of President in the 2016 election.|$|E

Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although he was unable <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last twenty minutes of the session due to brake issues.

5|$|Neither he nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and neither {{was a member of}} the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2013, Rajoelina officially renounced his {{candidature}} in {{the next}} presidential election, then planned for May 2013. This decision followed a similar declaration {{on the part of}} former president Ravalomanana. Exclusion of both political figures from the next general election was a key precondition to international recognition of the elections, as defined by the Southern African Development Community in its roadmap toward ending the political crisis. Rajoelina expressed support for Edgar Razafindravahy, interim mayor of Antananarivo and the official candidate of the TGV party among several other party candidates, and declared his intention <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2018 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{resigned}} from his federal post <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1951 election in Philadelphia. The Democrats nominated {{him for the}} recorder of deeds post which, unlike the Washington position, was elected by the voters. He was victorious in the election, winning {{as a part of}} a Democratic wave that swept the Republican Party from power for the first time in 67 years. The job, a former county-level position, was eliminated and the department consolidated into city government in 1953. Shepard was named to the equivalent civil service position, Commissioner of Records, after the consolidation.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire {{and ran for the}} Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
