5|$|At {{certain times}} {{there was an}} {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies.

5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Priest,</b> Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but to}} slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were {{transformed}} from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E
5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet. Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> Caiaphas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood {{in which many}} Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location. The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{after hearing}} {{a case against}} Cumanus in Iudaea, Quadratus sent him, along with several Jewish and Samaritan leaders {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> Ananias, to plead their cases in Rome before the Emperor Claudius. At the hearing, several of Claudius' influential freedmen officials took the side of Cumanus. However, the Jews were supported by Agrippa II, a friend of Claudius whose father, Agrippa I, had been the last king of Iudaea before the province was placed under Roman procurators. Whether influenced by court politics or not, Claudius decided in favour of the Jewish side. The Samaritan leaders were executed and Cumanus was sent into exile. Felix succeeded him as procurator of Iudaea. Cumanus' life and career after his banishment are unknown.|$|E

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. They removed most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E
