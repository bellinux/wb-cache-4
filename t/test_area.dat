5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules <b>test</b> <b>area.</b> A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E

Initially, he commuted {{back and forth between}} San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a trip to New Mexico on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the <b>test</b> <b>area</b> known as the Anchor Ranch, and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis for the bachelors degree {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and subsequent evaluation of the fawn mortality during haymaking in the hunting district HS Kalec, county Plzeň-sever (Pilsen-North), located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The first part of this thesis describes Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus), its population in this territory, biology, ethology and its management. The second part describes the project as such involving three model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> that were selected and marked out in the hunting district HS Kalec; before the haymaking time from June 15 to June 24, 2015, adequate protection measures were undertaken in these areas. Locality of the first model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 1 was attended (walked) by gamekeepers with dogs. Locality of the second model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 2 was treated with the game scent repeller and also equipped with acoustic disturber. The third model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 was only monitored. These model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were re-visited after hay crop and the result is that in the vicinity of the model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 two fawns were cut and killed. In both other model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> no cut fawns were found. After hay crop and subsequent determining the actual number of cut fawns, these <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were compared mutually and the results will be stated in this thesis for the bachelors degree. The essential aspect was to evaluate the fawns mortality in the specific hunting district based on the obtained facts. Relation to the mitigation measures set in place was examined. This work resulted in saving three fawns. Outcomes of this thesis have provided rather interesting findings that can be further exploited in the gamekeeping management. Particularly in relation to the roe deer management in the gamekeeping practice. Keywords/tags: roe deer, fawns, killing, hunting district (HS Kalec, Žihle...|$|R
5|$|Oppenheimer {{had already}} {{recruited}} key people for Parson's Ordnance Division. Edwin McMillan was a physicist {{who headed the}} Proving Ground Group. His first task was to establish the ordnance <b>test</b> <b>area.</b> Later he became Parsons' deputy for the gun-type fission weapon. Charles Critchfield, a mathematical physicist with ordnance experience at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, {{was in charge of}} the Target, Projectile and Source Group. Kenneth Bainbridge arrived in August to take charge of the Instrumentation Group. Parsons recruited Robert Brode from the proximity fuze project to become head of the Fuze Development Group. Joseph Hirschfelder was brought in as an expert on internal ballistics, and headed the Interior Ballistics Group. From the beginning, Parsons wanted Norman Ramsey as the head of the delivery group. Edward L. Bowles, the scientific adviser to the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, was reluctant to part with Ramsey, but gave way under pressure from Groves, Tolman and Bush. Perhaps the most controversial group head would be Seth Neddermeyer, the head of the Implosion Experimentation Group; for the time being, Parson accorded a relatively low priority to this work. He also recruited Hazel Greenbacker as his secretary.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a special <b>test</b> <b>area</b> in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

30|$|The {{conception}} of a GMP monitoring program - selection of <b>test</b> <b>areas,</b> appropriate indicators, methods, farmers' clarification, etc. - should start far earlier than the GMP cropping. Importantly, the initial sampling design has to consider that farmers may deny work on their private properties. A total of 1, 360 involved farmers were informed about the project BINATS. Sixty-nine of these denied work on their fields. Twenty-seven of the 100 pre-selected <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were affected by this prohibition. Twenty-one of these <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> could be retained by shifting survey circles appropriately [48]. Six <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> had to be shifted as a whole along the Austrian forest inventory raster. However, sizes of Austrian farms are small (average farm size, 18.9 ha) [59] as compared to other EU countries, and problems with denied access may be more serious with larger farm sizes.|$|R
40|$|Optimal scale {{selection}} {{is the key}} step of the slope segmentation. Taking three geomorphological units {{in different parts of}} the loess as <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and 5 m-resolution DEMs as original test date, this paper employed the changed ROC-LV (Lucian, 2010) in judging the optimal scales in the slope segmentation process. The experiment results showed that this method is effective in determining the optimal scale in the slope segmentation. The results also showed that the slope segmentation of the different geomorphological units require different optimal scales because the landform complexity is varied. The three <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require the same scale which could distinguish the small gully because all the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> have many gullies of the same size, however, when come to distinguish the basins, since the complexity of the three areas is different, the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require different scales...|$|R

25|$|A {{suitable}} <b>test</b> <b>area</b> {{was required}} for this convenient to Pasadena, California, so the area was transferred from the Army to the Navy in October 1943, and commissioned as the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS), Inyokern, on 8 November 1943, {{under the command of}} Captain Sherman E. Burroughs, Jr. Workshops, laboratories and facilities were constructed for over 600 men. During 1944, NOTS worked on the development and testing of the 3.5-inch, 5-inch, HVAR and 11.75-inch (Tiny Tim) rockets.|$|E
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The <b>test</b> <b>area</b> should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E

Other targets included a minefield, chambers and tunnels, reinforced concrete arches, fiberglass shelters, full scale troop models exposed and inside vehicles and gas masks. 60% of the targets were buried. Smoke mortars were installed to provide a white trail by which the shock wave could be tracked high above ground.

500|$|Crewed by a seven-man team, {{the first}} {{aircraft}} performed a short {{take off from}} Svyatoshino Airfield, Kiev. This was the first flight of an aircraft that was powered only by propfans. Due to worsening weather conditions over Antonov's headquarters and the flight <b>test</b> <b>area</b> in Kiev, the flight was cut short, and the flight ceiling was capped at 2,000 m (6,500ft). The crew took the aircraft to a height of 450 m (1,475ft), while performing basic checkouts of the prototype's systems. After having been airborne for less than half an hour, the aircraft landed at Antonov's flight test facility at Gostomel. During the flight, engineers identified problems with the engine gearboxes, and so the aircraft was grounded for eight weeks while the issues were fixed.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Parsons' {{division}} designed the gun-type plutonium weapon, codenamed Thin Man. It was assumed that a uranium-235 weapon would be similar in nature. Hirschfelder's group considered various designs, and evaluated different propellants. The ordnance <b>test</b> <b>area,</b> which became known as [...] "Anchor Ranch", was established on a nearby ranch, where Parsons conducted test firings with a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. Work on implosion lagged by comparison, {{but this was not}} initially a major concern, because it was expected that the gun-type would work with both uranium and plutonium. However, Oppenheimer, Groves and Parsons lobbied Purnell and Tolman to get John von Neumann {{to have a look at}} the problem. Von Neumann suggested the use of shaped charges to initiate implosion.|$|E
