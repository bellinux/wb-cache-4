In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out system <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into one long section. This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at the bakery {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when the bakery was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over the bakery to house his family. In the 1930s, the bakery employed 25 workers and had one production line that turned out 8,500 loaves per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, the bakery contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|Installation 04, also {{referred}} to as Alpha Halo, appears in [...] The majority of gameplay takes place in areas on this installation, and its exploration drives the story. The ring was managed by an artificial intelligence known as 343 Guilty Spark, and is located in the Soell system, dominated by a gas giant known as Threshold. Halo orbits Threshold's only satellite, an extremely large moon known as Basis. A group of humans aboard the ship Pillar of Autumn crash-land on the ring after being pursued by the alien Covenant. The ring holds religious significance to the aliens, while the humans believe it is a weapon <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the tide of the war against the Covenant in their favor. In reality, the ring is home to a virulent parasite called the Flood, which is accidentally released by the Covenant and threatens to infest the galaxy. The human soldier Master Chief eventually detonates the Pillar of Autumns reactors in order to destabilize the ring and cause it to break up, preventing the spread of the Flood and the activation of the Halo network, which would kill all sentient life as a fail-safe to starve the Flood. The Ark was alerted to its destruction and proceeded to create Installation 04B, which, too, was destroyed by Master Chief. During the game's events, Guilty Spark alludes to a previous firing of the network, which Bungie's director of cinematics Joseph Staten said occurred around 100,000 years previous to the events of the game in the year 2552.After Installation 04 was destroyed, a piece of Halo ring has slipspace to a red Giant.|$|E

The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by Gottfried Mayer-Kress in 1995, while the first algorithms <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by Francis Heylighen and Johan Bollen in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Other common {{celebrations}} {{and religious}} or national holidays such as birthdays, Halloween, Easter and Christmas are not celebrated {{because they believe}} that these continue to involve [...] "false religious beliefs or activities."

2500|$|In 1863, {{in command}} of the Department of the West, he was criticized for his {{inaction}} and failure in the Vicksburg Campaign. In 1864, he fought against Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign. Facing an enemy with a massive numerical advantage, Johnston's strategy was to strategically withdraw whenever it was necessary to avoid being surrounded or cut off from his supply lines, while looking for the right opportunity to make a defensive stand. [...] Although he won a minor victory against Sherman at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, the opportunity to make a decisive stand <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> back the Union tide never came. [...] Fed up with Johnston's constant withdrawal from Confederate territory, Davis relieved him of command after he withdrew from northwest Georgia to the outskirts of the city.|$|E

Another flash of {{lightning}} showed the horses with heaving flanks and nodding heads; the men, white eye-balled, glaring beside them, and the stone watch-tower to the left.

Now, if the Lord would lend them a hand, fighting cannot be sinful. I have often been nonplused, though, to find that they used them chariots instead of heavy dragoons, who are, in all comparison, better to break a line of infantry, and who, for the matter of <b>that,</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> such wheel carriages, and getting into the rear, play the very devil with them, horse and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, the old squire was {{a shrewd}} {{man of the}} world, and was not {{therefore}} slow to guess that what prevented this understanding from being openly acknowledged as an engagement was some entanglement on his son's part. Indeed, it had recently become clear to him that London had developed strange attractions for Philip. That this entanglement could be marriage was, however, an idea that never entered into his head; he had too good an opinion of his son's common- sense to believe it possible that he would deliberately jeopardize his inheritance by marrying without his permission. But Philip's reluctance and obstinacy annoyed him excessively. [...] "Devil" [...] Caresfoot {{was not a man}} accustomed to be thwarted; indeed, he had never been thwarted in his life, and he did not mean to be now. He had set his heart upon this marriage, and {{it would have to be}} a good reason <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> him from his purpose.|$|E

6000|$|While I {{believe that}} our {{language}} had two periods of culmination in poetic beauty,--one of nature, simplicity, and truth, in the ballads, which deal only with narrative and feeling,--another of Art, (or Nature as it is ideally reproduced through the imagination,) of stately amplitude, of passionate intensity and elevation, in Spenser and the greater dramatists,--and that Shakespeare made use of the latter as he found it, I by no means intend {{to say that he}} did not enrich it, or that any inferior man could have dipped the same words out of the great poet's inkstand. But he enriched it only by the natural expansion and exhilaration of which it was conscious, in yielding to the mastery of a genius <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> and wind it like a fiery Pegasus, making it feel its life in every limb.

6000|$|He was himself, as {{appeared}} by and by, {{a fighter}} {{of the first}} quality, {{when it came to}} that: but never was willing to fight if he could help it. Preferred rather to shift, manoeuvre and negotiate; which he did in a most vigilant, adroit and masterly manner. But by degrees he had grown to have, and could maintain it, an Army of 24,000 men: among the best troops then in being. With or without his will, he was in all the great Wars of his time,--the time of Louis XIV., who kindled Europe four times over, thrice in our Kurfurst's day. The Kurfurst's Dominions, a long straggling country, reaching from Memel to Wesel, could hardly keep {{out of the way of}} any war that might rise. He made himself available, never against the good cause of Protestantism and German Freedom, yet always in the place and way where his own best advantage was to be had. Louis XIV. had often much need of him: still oftener, and more pressingly, had Kaiser Leopold, the little Gentleman [...] "in scarlet stockings, with a red feather in his hat," [...] whom Mr. Savage used to see majestically walking about, with Austrian lip that said nothing at all. [A Compleat History of Germany, by Mr. Savage (8vo, London, 1702), p. 553. Who this Mr. Savage was, we have no trace. Prefixed to the volume is the Portrait of a solid Gentleman of forty: gloomily polite, with ample wig and cravat,--in all likelihood some studious subaltern Diplomatist in the Succession War. His little Book is very lean and barren: but faithfully compiled,--and might have some illumination in it, where utter darkness is so prevalent. Most likely, Addison picked his story of the Siege of Weinsberg ("Women carrying out their Husbands on their back,"--one of his best SPECTATORS) out of this poor Book.] His 24,000 excellent fighting-men, thrown in at the right time, were often a thing <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> the balance in great questions.
