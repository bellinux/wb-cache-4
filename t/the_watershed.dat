5|$|Mining has {{historically}} been done in <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> of Nanticoke Creek. This has substantially altered the hydrology and topography of <b>the</b> <b>watershed.</b> The period during which <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> was mined lasted more than 100 years.

5|$|The Susquehanna River {{watershed}} {{is immediately}} {{north and west}} of <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> of Black Creek, while <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> of Turtle Creek is located immediately south of <b>the</b> <b>watershed.</b> The eastern edge of <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> (the part that was studied during the 1960s study of <b>the</b> <b>watershed)</b> includes a barrier pillar between the West End Mine and the Glen Lyon Mine.

30|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> {{study area}} the form factor values ranges from 0.17 (Kalungi watershed) to 0.53 (Sendarapatti <b>watershed).</b> Among <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area the {{estimated}} form factor value is low (≤  0.25) in Kalungi, Silaiyur, Belur, Kallar and Valaiyur watersheds, and high (>  0.40) in Sendarapatti, Thalugai, Nakkaselam and Shobanapuram watersheds. In rest of <b>the</b> other <b>watersheds</b> it is moderate (0.26 – 0.40). The form factor values estimated for <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area {{shows that it}} ranges from 0.17 (Kalungi watershed) to 0.53 (Sendarapatti <b>watershed)</b> which reflect <b>the</b> elongated shape of all <b>the</b> <b>watersheds,</b> and <b>the</b> variation in form factor values among <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> reflects only <b>the</b> degree of elongation of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds.</b>|$|R
30|$|Bifurcation ratio {{serves as}} useful index in {{understanding}} geological disturbances in an area. In the present study, the bifurcation ratio values obtained for <b>the</b> various <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area {{have been used}} to bring out <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> which are structurally disturbed. Among <b>the</b> <b>watersheds,</b> watersheds 34 and 36 found to have undergone greater structural disturbances and their drainage patterns have been relatively highly distorted by the structural disturbances.|$|R
30|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> {{study area}} are either {{fourth or fifth}} order <b>watersheds.</b> <b>The</b> trunk stream of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> {{is found to be}} medium stream with the {{exception}} of Valaiyur watershed where it is a headwater stream. The number of streams decreases with increasing stream order in all <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area. The lower order (first and second order) streams constitute very high proportion (ranging from about 91 to 97 %), of the streams of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds,</b> characteristic of hilly <b>watersheds.</b> <b>The</b> analysis of the proportion of lower order streams of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> shows that Valaiyur, Belur, Kalungi, Solaimatti and Kallar watersheds are characteristic of steeper slopes and quicker water flow, whereas Nakkasalem, Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur and Talugai watersheds are less steeper with relatively lesser water flow velocity. The distinct variation of bifurcation ratio values among various orders in each <b>watershed,</b> reflects <b>the</b> variations in local physiography and geological conditions within each <b>watershed.</b> <b>The</b> analysis of mean bifurcation ration values of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> shows that <b>the</b> drainage network in all <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area is well developed. It also shows the relatively greater degree of branching, lesser elongation, and higher flash flood potential of Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Gangavalli, Koneri, Kanappadi and Sengattupatti watersheds, and lesser degree of branching, greater elongation and lesser flash flood potential of Belur, Valaiyur, Kallar and Kalungi <b>watersheds.</b> <b>The</b> mean annual run off would be higher in Koneri, Thalugai, Shobanapuram and Kottarakkannu watersheds on account of their high total stream lengths, and relatively lower in Valaiyur, Nakkaselam, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Silaiyur, Solaimatti, Pulambadi and Periyakaruppu Odai watersheds on account of their low total stream lengths. In general, it is observed that the mean stream length increases with the stream order in almost all <b>the</b> <b>watersheds.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{large part}} of <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> of Darby Creek is on {{developed}} land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in <b>the</b> <b>watershed.</b> The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space.

50|$|The {{mouth of}} Kashinka Hollow lies over limestone, {{while the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>watershed's</b> lower reaches lie on shale. Most of <b>the</b> <b>watershed's</b> middle and upper reaches lie over siltstone, but the {{uppermost}} reaches are on mudstone.|$|R
30|$|Factor III of {{the aspects}} {{was with the}} {{loadings}} of Relief Ratio, RR (0.627) with a percentage variance of 10.72 % and eigen value of 1.286. This accounts for <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> with steep slope facilitating more erosion and leads to the greater discharge of sediments. However, this nature lessens the groundwater potential in <b>the</b> <b>watersheds.</b> In supporting <b>the</b> factor III, it is meticulously illustrated through the box patterns which demonstrate the overland flow of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds.</b>|$|R

5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>watershed</b> of the creek is largely developed, with roughly {{half a million people}} inhabiting it.

5|$|In {{modern times}} the {{population}} of <b>the</b> <b>watershed</b> of Buffalo Creek has been rising, unlike the surrounding areas. The production of timber was once a major industry in <b>the</b> <b>watershed.</b> However, farming and livestock production are more common.|$|E
30|$|It is {{the ratio}} of the mean length of streams of one order to that of the next higher order. It tends to be {{constant}} throughout the successive orders of a watershed (Horton 1945). Estimation of length ratio and the mean length ratio for the various stream orders of <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> and for each watershed were made. Variations in length ratio exist between successive stream orders in all <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area and such differences are commonly observed in several other studies (Horton 1945; Mesa 2006). These differences are attributed mainly due to differences in slope and topographic conditions within <b>the</b> <b>watersheds.</b> Among <b>the</b> <b>watersheds</b> of <b>the</b> study area, the mean length ratio is found to range from 0.41 (for Belur watershed) to 3.37 (Gangavalli <b>watershed).</b> <b>The</b> ratio is low (≤  0.50) in Belur, Kalungi and Valaiyur watersheds and high (>  0.90) in Gangavalli, Maruvattur and Koneri watersheds. In rest of <b>the</b> other <b>watersheds</b> it is moderate (0.51 – 0.90).|$|R

5|$|The bedrock {{is exposed}} on the ridges in <b>the</b> Black Creek <b>watershed.</b> <b>The</b> {{exposure}} {{is due to}} glaciofluvial deposits disappearing due to erosion and mining. There are many faults in <b>the</b> <b>watershed's</b> rocks.|$|R
5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, the bedrock {{is made up of}} sandstone.

30|$|Watershed area {{is defined}} as the total area {{projected}} upon a horizontal plane {{and is one of the}} important morphometrical parameters related to hydrological process.
