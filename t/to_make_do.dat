5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials and had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with fewer resources {{than she would}} have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E

5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do.</b> This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with ordinary summer uniforms, but {{in the winter of}} 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E
5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with him a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed {{to know exactly what}} they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with a cardboard cutout.|$|E
5|$|In March 1991, in {{his fourth}} top {{division}} tournament, Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins, and became the youngest ever sanshō or special prize winner, receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV, and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna. Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards. In January 1992, he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion (19years 5months). He {{was too young to}} drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party, and had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with oolong tea instead. After his second championship in September 1992, followed by two good scores of 10–5 and 11–4 in the next two tournaments, he was promoted to ōzeki in January 1993, the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna.|$|E

5|$|Janáček {{originally}} intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873–76). In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, he had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský's performance of the Gregorian mass {{was published in the}} March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class. On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček's wife. In 1876 he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brněnská Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter {{was compounded by}} the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>do</b> without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E
