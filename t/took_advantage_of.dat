Our method produces accurate shading for arbitrary and dynamically changing directional lights, viewing parameters, and transfer functions. This is achieved by hardware interpolating the data values and gradients before software classi cation and shading. The method works equally well for parallel and perspective projections. We present two approaches for our method: one which <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> software ray casting optimizations and another which <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> hardware blending acceleration...|$|R
