25|$|Colonel Johnson {{was ordered}} to move his men from their {{position}} {{at the center of}} the lines to a new position farther to the left, just six days before a massive Union attack took place. When he was given this order, no defensive fortifications existed at the location, and a frantic effort began to construct earthworks in anticipation of a coming assault. The men built a formidable parapet surrounding their camp on three sides, with an exterior trench running alongside it, to create a fortification known as a lunette. The ground dropped off steeply all around the wall, giving the fort a natural advantage. The timber was cut outside the wall, and <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> <b>of</b> tree branches and brush covering the ground made the uphill approach very slow, difficult, and dangerous. Throughout the siege, work continued on the fortifications, mostly at night. Improvements were made, and damage caused by the continuous Union artillery bombardment was repaired.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover for}} Revolver {{was created by}} German-born bassist and artist Klaus Voormann, one of the Beatles' oldest friends from their time in Hamburg during the early 1960s. Voormann's artwork was part line drawing and part collage, using {{photographs}} mostly taken over 1964–65 by Robert Freeman. In his line drawings of the four Beatles, Voormann drew inspiration {{from the work of}} the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, who {{was the subject of a}} long-running exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1966 and highly influential on fashion and design themes of the time. Voormann placed the various photos within <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> <b>of</b> hair that connects the four faces. Turner writes that the drawings show each Beatle [...] "in another state of consciousness", such that the older images appear to be tumbling out from them.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Stern's first {{impression}} of the bandit was [...] "Errol Flynn portraying Pancho Villa". Gavin Maxwell pointed out that Giuliano was a romantic, hankering after justice from an early age—the bandit's favorite author, Emilio Salgari, made a career from idealistic, romantic novels, and Giuliano was still reading them in his twenties living rough in the mountains. Gaia Servadio sees the bandit {{as a tool of}} the Mafia, whose notoriety and success were not the product of his personal qualities, but entirely a function of his mafioso protectors. She judges that he was easily eliminated once the protectors withdrew their support. For John Dickie, the “truth” of Giuliano resides not in his character, but in <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> <b>of</b> power and politics that enmeshed his life—centered on the Mafia. [...] Natalia Danesi Murray described Giuliano as a “theatrical megalomaniac.” ...|$|E
2500|$|McNamara's {{institution}} of systems analysis {{as a basis}} for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: [...] "First, the word 'systems' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word 'analysis' emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> <b>of</b> significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it." [...] Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. It was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.|$|E
2500|$|The {{waves of}} {{infantry}} were engaged by massed small-arms fire from II Battalion, Infantry Regiment Lehr and III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 122, which destroyed the attack formation, from which {{small groups of}} survivors continued the advance. The 114th Brigade reached the wood quickly behind the barrage and dug in at the first objective. Further west the battalion of the 113th Brigade lost the barrage but managed to reach the first objective, despite crossfire and shelling by British guns. Various German parties surrendered and despite the chaos, {{it appeared that the}} German defence of the wood had collapsed. The artillery schedule could not be changed at such short notice and the German defence had two hours to recover. The advance to the second objective at [...] was delayed and conditions in the wood made it difficult {{to keep up with the}} barrage; an attack on an area called Hammerhead was forced back by a German counter-attack. On the left flank, fire from Quadrangle Alley stopped the advance and contact with the rear was lost, amidst <b>the</b> <b>tangle</b> <b>of</b> undergrowth and fallen trees. The barrage was eventually brought back and two battalions of the 115th Brigade were sent forward as reinforcements.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 October, German {{aircraft}} appeared over British artillery positions from Guedecourt to Flers {{and directed}} artillery fire onto the British batteries; the fighter pilots of IV Brigade {{found that the}} German aircraft had {{gone by the time}} that they arrived. Contact patrol pilots found that the westerly wind was so strong that they had to turn into the wind, for the observers to study the ground, which made them nearly stationary and easy targets for infantry ground fire. Two crew were wounded and many of the aircraft were damaged. At [...] zero hour for the Fourth Army attack, the 12th DLI of the 68th Brigade attacked on the right flank in four waves behind a tank. The tank had arrived a minute after zero and cleared <b>the</b> <b>Tangle</b> <b>of</b> German defenders, before it was occupied by the infantry. When the tank turned left at the sunken Eaucourt l'Abbaye–Le Sars road, it was knocked out by a shell. The infantry came under machine-gun fire from the road and crossfire from machine-guns in Le Sars and from the right flank; the battalion formed a defensive flank from the tangle to the right of British front line. The 9th Green Howards of the 69th Brigade had advanced on the left flank {{at the same time and}} entered Le Sars close behind the barrage, heading for the first objective at the crossroads in the village.|$|E

The barrage was eventually brought back and two battalions of the 115th Brigade were sent forward as reinforcements. The Hammerhead fell after a Stokes mortar bombardment and a German battalion headquarters was captured around [...] after which the German defence began to collapse. More British reinforcements arrived and attacks by the 50th Brigade of the 17th Division on the left flank, helped capture Wood Support Trench. The advance resumed at [...] and after two hours, reached the northern fringe of the wood. Attempts to advance further were stopped by machine-gun fire and a defensive line [...] inside the wood was dug. A resumption of the attack in the evening was cancelled and a withdrawal further into the wood saved the infantry from a German bombardment {{along the edge of}} the wood. In the early hours of 11 July, the 115th Brigade relieved the attacking brigades and at [...] a position was consolidated [...] inside the wood but then abandoned due to German artillery-fire. The 38th Division was relieved by a brigade of the 12th Division by [...] on 12 July, which searched the wood and completed its occupation, the German defence having lost [...] "countless brave men"; the 38th Division had lost [...] The northern fringe was reoccupied and linked with the 7th Division on the right and the 1st Division on the left, under constant bombardment by shrapnel, lachrymatory, high explosive and gas shell, the 62nd Brigade losing [...] by 16 July.|$|E
