Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94.

30|$|In this study, {{patients}} with toxic hepatitis received lesser proportion of gastric lavage and active charcoal than {{patients with}}out toxic hepatitis (Table  4). This {{could be due}} to longer <b>time</b> <b>elapse</b> between acetaminophen ingestion and hospital arrival in patients with than without toxic hepatitis (Table  1). Similarly, the <b>time</b> <b>elapse</b> was not a significant risk factor for mortality after logistic regression analysis (Table  5). In a study that was conducted in Hong Kong (Chan et al., 1996), {{it was found that the}} <b>time</b> that <b>elapsed</b> between acetaminophen ingestion and treatment was the most important prognostic factor for liver toxicity. However, the N-acetylcysteine antidote was only used in 50 % of the patients (Chan et al., 1996), but the proportion of patients that received N-acetylcysteine treatment was as high as 78.6 % in our study (Table  4). Therefore, it is unclear whether the difference in the use of the N-acetylcysteine antidote could influence predictions of <b>time</b> <b>elapses</b> for toxic hepatitis.|$|R

5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the short amount of <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, {{it is unclear whether}} the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
