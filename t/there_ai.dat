40|$|Modern machine {{learning}} attempts to erase all distinctions between {{various kinds of}} induction from data, as if all learning from cases can be expressed as the selection of features followed by the determination of an appropriate set of separating hyperplanes in that feature space, {{on which to build}} a statistically effective classifier. In this recent research programme that has been dominating AI (artificial intelligence), the intellectual question is no more than what is the preferred mathematical transformation of feature space that permits convenient re-representation of data, e. g., what is your favorite kind of nonlinear support vector kernel? Few things could be more historically or intellectually insulting to the student of theory-formation in the grand tradition of Nagel, Carnap, Hempel and Popper (see [10]). There are different purposes for different kinds of induction and in a few cases, notably, the cases of scientific induction and legal induction, the modeling of the nuances has led to great ideas in the history of logic and reasoning. Many philosophers will not know the work of Hart, Raz, MacCormick, and Schauer on legal theory-formation (the “positivists ” in law, see [14]), but the domain-specific complexities are arguably even more interesting <b>there.</b> <b>AI</b> at one time had more interest in these nuances, for example, in the works of Simon [15], Lena...|$|E

Very little was changed in regards to controls, movement rate, physics, and CON (control file) language.
