40|$|In Tahltan, an Athabascan SOV {{language}} spoken in northwest British Columbia (Canada), the predicate is complex, {{as a rule}} consisting of prefixes and a variable verb stem. Below, I will show that morphonological alternation in Tahltan verb stems is a conditioned (regular) process: regularity is revealed when one considers Tahltan verb stem allomorphy from a diachronic viewpoint, where older forms {{take the place of}} underlying forms used in other theoretical (synchronic) approaches. When contemplating Tahltan verbal processes regardless of their historical development, one is challenged by erratic vowel alternations and the virtual impossibility to make a classification of allomorphic types due to merging of certain stemfinal consonants with (petrified) suffixes. In addition, Tahltan appears conservative in comparison with other Athabascan insofar as it has retained some stem-final affricates. These facts, along with the archaic nature of the Tahltan phoneme inventory in general (Nater 1989 : 5. 3, <b>tables</b> <b>4</b> - <b>12),</b> have convinced me that a thorough description of the Tahltan verb should not lack diachronic considerations...|$|R
40|$|Orthogonal wavelets, or wavelet frames, for L^ 2 (R) are {{associated}} with quadrature mirror filters (QMF). The latter constitute a set of complex numbers which relate the dyadic scaling of functions on R to the Z-translates, and which satisfy the QMF-axioms. In this paper, we show that generically, the data in the QMF-systems of wavelets is minimal, {{in the sense that}} it cannot be nontrivially reduced. The minimality property is given a geometric formulation in the Hilbert space l^ 2 (Z), and it is then shown that minimality corresponds to irreducibility of a wavelet representation of the algebra O_ 2; and so our result is that this family of representations of O_ 2 on the Hilbert space l^ 2 (Z) is irreducible for a generic set of values of the parameters which label the wavelet representations.

40|$|The paper {{examined}} the hedging effectiveness of optimal hedge ratios derived from four different models: ordinary least square model, a vector auto-regression, a vector error-correction model and a dynamic conditional correlation generalized {{autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity}} (DCC-GARCH) model. The hedged portfolio consisted of finance sector sub-index and finance sector index futures and electronics sector sub-index and electronics sector index futures. Daily observations covered the period 21 July 1999 - 31 December 2007. In both sectors for Taiwan sector index futures, hedge ratio derived from ordinary least square model provided greater risk reduction, whereas hedge ratio derived from DCC-GARCH model yielded higher utility. The results would be useful for risk managers dealing with Taiwan sector index futures. 本文應用了四個不同統計模型（回歸模型、VAR模型、VECM模型及雙變量GARCH模型）估計最適期貨避險比例，而進而根據此避險比例比較不同模型的避險績效。研究資料來源為台灣電子類股指數、台灣金融類股指數、台灣電子類股指數期貨及台灣金融類股指數期貨，其資料區間為 1999 年 7 月 21 日至 2007 年 12 月 31 號日資料。實證結果顯示，回歸模型避險比例在電子及金融指數能夠最佳的降低風險，而DCC-GARCH模型在電子及金融指數能夠最佳的提升效能。Table of Contents 1 Introduction	 1 1. 1 Research background	 1 1. 2 Research objectives	 2 1. 3 Research targets	 2 1. 4 Research process	 2 2 Literature Review	 4 2. 1 Futures contract	 4 2. 1. 1 Definition of futures contract	 4 2. 1. 2 Hedging with futures contract	 4 2. 2 Theory of hedging	 5 2. 2. 1 Traditional hedging theory and Working''s hypothesis 5 2. 2. 2 Portfolio approach hedging theory and hedging effectiveness	 5 2. 3 Vector autoregressive model	 18 2. 4 Vector error-correction model	 18 2. 5 Multivariate DCC-GARCH model	 19 3 Research Methods	 20 3. 1 Research structure	 20 3. 2 Stationary process	 22 3. 3 Unit root test	 22 3. 3. 1 Augment Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test	 22 3. 3. 2 Phillips-Perron test	 23 3. 3. 3 Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test	 24 3. 3. 4 Lag length selection	 25 3. 4 Conventional OLS regression model	 26 3. 5 Bivariate vector autoregressive model (VAR) 	 26 3. 6 Test for cointegration	 27 3. 6. 1 The Engle-Granger two-step method	 27 3. 6. 2 Johansen procedure	 28 3. 6. 3 Test statistics for number of cointegrating relationships	 30 3. 7 Vector error correction model (VECM) 	 31 3. 8 Autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH) model	 32 3. 8. 1 ARCH test	 33 3. 8. 2 Constant conditional correlation (CCC) test	 33 3. 9 The constant conditional correlation model	 34 3. 10 The DCC Multivariate GARCH Model	 34 3. 10. 1 Characteristics of DCC-GARCH model	 35 3. 10. 2 Process of DCC-GARCH estimation	 36 3. 10. 3 Method in parameter estimation	 37 3. 11 Hedge ratio calculation	 38 3. 11. 1 Minimum variance comparison	 38 3. 11. 2 Utility-based comparison	 39 4 Data and Preliminary Analyses	 40 4. 1 Data selection and data period selection	 40 4. 2 History of index futures market	 41 4. 3 Variable name abbreviation	 41 4. 4 Descriptive statistics analysis	 42 4. 5 Unit root test results	 42 4. 6 OLS Regression model	 44 4. 7 Selection of optimal lag length	 44 4. 8 Vector autoregressive model	 45 4. 9 Tests for cointegration	 47 4. 10 Vector Error Correction Model	 48 4. 11 Constant conditional correlation (CCC) test	 49 <b>4.</b> <b>12</b> VECM-DCC-GARCH model	 50 4. 13 Hedging effectiveness comparison	 53 4. 13. 1 Minimum variance comparison	 54 4. 13. 2 Utility-based comparison	 54 5 Conclusions and Recommendations	 56 5. 1 	Conclusions	 56 5. 2 Recommendations for future researches	 57 References	 58 Appendices	 62 Appendix A: Model Results	 62 Appendix B: Spot and futures price series	 69 Appendix C: Futures contract specification	 71 List of Tables Table 2 -

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the underlying {{assumptions of the}} sampling distribution {{and its role in}} significance testing. To compute statistical significance, estimates of population parameters must be obtained so that only one sampling distribution is defined. A sampling distribution is the underlying distribution of a statistic. Sampling distributions are theoretical distributions that comprise an infinite number of sample statistics from an infinite number of randomly selected samples of a specified sample size. The influence that a large sample size has on statistical significance is demonstrated through some "what if " analyses. A "what if " analysis is simply an analysis of variance summary table in which the sample size is changed to see how statistical significance is affected. A large enough sample size invariably leads to statistical significance. Researchers with large sample sizes should look for other ways to interpret their results. One such way is effect size, which is a variance accounted for statistic that can tell how much of the variability in a dependent variable {{can be explained by the}} independent variables.

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{compute the}} effective short-range potentials arising from second order QCD-diagrams related to bound states of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons. Our formalism {{relies on the}} assumption that the exchanged gluons are massless, while the constituent gluons as well as the lightest quarks acquire a nonvanishing constituent mass because of confinement. The potentials we obtain include the first relativistic corrections, thus spin-spin terms, spin-orbit terms, etc. Such effective potentials are expected to be relevant for the building of accurate potential models describing usual hadrons as well as exotic ones like glueballs and qq̅ g hybrids. In particular, we compute for the first time an effective quark-gluon potential, and show the existence of a quadrupolar interaction term in this case. We also discuss the influence of a possible nonzero mass for the exchanged gluons. Comment: 33 pages, <b>4</b> <b>tables</b> and <b>12</b> figures; typos correcte...|$|R

40|$|Having {{reviewed}} {{the analysis of}} Fula crude oil prior to desalting treatment, {{it was observed that}} the crude has high density of 936. 2 kg/m 3 at 15 o C, high viscosity of 69. 42 mm 2 /s at 100 oC and high calcium content of 1287 ppm (table(2. 1)). On the other hand it was observed that the calcium content after electrical desalting was also high amounting up to 307 ppm((table (2. 3)). The high calcium content affects the price and the environmental specifications. Inefficient separation process of salts causes serious problems such as discount of oil price, corrosion risks at the distillation columns, catalytic poisoning, formation of scale deposits in pipes and heat - exchangers. Although the electrical desalting treatment is very efficient for dehydration of crude, the efficiency of such device for calcium separation was low. Equipment other than the electrical desalting unit were reviewed, and it was found that a mixer – settler type of contactors was quite suitable and might improve the efficiency of calcium separation. A Preliminary investigation was undertaken to investigate the factors of temperature, dilution ratio, water to oil ratio, time and speed of agitation on the fluid properties mainly the density and viscosity. From the preliminary study the range of the low and high levels of the above mentioned factors were (90 - 120 oC, 5 - 30 %, 10 - 80 %, 5 - 20 minutes and 300 - 400 rpm) respectively. Once determining the range of the above mentioned parameters, factorial experiments were designed to investigate the effects of these parameters on dehydration and salt separation. 9 One set of the experiments were carried out {{with the addition of a}} demulsifier and the other set was carried out without any addition as shown in <b>tables</b> (<b>4.</b> <b>12)</b> and (<b>4.</b> 13). These experiments showed that the demulsifier had improved the dehydration and settlement, but in both sets of factorial experiments no improvement was observed on calcium separation. This was because the calcium was fixed to the crude in form of calcium naphthanate which was difficult to remove. Hence, it was decided to use acetic acid as a decalcinizing agent, as the acetic acid has the ability to break this fixation. Various concentrations of the decalcinizer were studied, the results showed that the concentration level at 0. 8 % and pH level of 5 improved the calcium removal, table(4. 19). Having specified the levels of all factors as well the concentrations of the demulsifier and the decalcinizer, a controlled experiment was carried out to determine the number of actual stages required to remove the calcium content up to 98. 0 ppm. A mixer – settler contactor was designed at the same levels taking the input rate of the desalter of Khartoum refinery, the dimensions of the mixer-settler were shown in tables(4. 22) and (4. 23). In conclusion a mixer –settler is recommended to be used for desalting of Fula crude due to its high separation efficiency of calcium and its low cost...|$|R

40|$|Water bamboo husk {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{agricultural}} wastes in Taiwan. In this study, the fiber and powder obtained from the water bamboo husk were chemically modified by coupling agents. Furthermore, the modified fiber and powder were added to the biodegradable polymer (polybutylene succinate, PBS), respectively, to form novel reinforced composites. Morphologies, mechanical properties and heat resistance of these water bamboo husk reinforced composites were investigated. The results indicate that the fibers modified by coupling agents exhibited better compatibility with the polymer matrices than the untreated fibers did. Moreover, the thermal properties were improved as the fiber was incorporated to those polymers. The mechanical properties were also increased with the addition of coupling agent treated fiber. On the other hand, it is found that the homogeneity of untreated powder-containing samples is better than that of untreated fiber-containing samples. Moreover, the results reveal that the powder modified with coupling agents were not effective in improving the mechanical properties of the reinforced PBS. This is due to the bulky structure of lignin leading to the smaller reaction ratio with the coupling agents. In the biodegradable test under soil field, the results indicate the polymer consisting of the fiber or powder modified by coupling agents Z 6020 (N--(aminoethyl) --aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) exhibited better biodegradability than the one consisting of untreated fiber or powder did. On the other hand, the composite with the fiber or powder modified by coupling agent Z 6040 (-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane) degraded more slowly than the one with the fiber or powder modified by coupling agent Z 6020 did. Moreover, the water bamboo husk containing composite degraded faster than PBS did. The effective application of the plant fiber or powder can not only reduce the biodegradable plastic cost, but also reduce the agricultural wastes burden to the environment. 茭白筍外殼是台灣較大宗的農業廢棄物之一。 本研究過程中，利用茭白筍外殼獲得的纖維和粉末以偶合劑進行化學改質，然後，分別添加到polybutylene succinate（PBS）中，形成新穎的植物纖維補強複合材料，並研究分析此一複合材料的形態學、機械性質和耐熱性。研究結果發現，經偶合劑改質過的纖維比未處理的纖維於高分子材料中，表現出更好的相容性。而且當植物纖維加入後，高分子材料的熱性質也獲得改善，而經由偶合劑改質纖維的複合材料其機械性質則有提高。另一方面，發現粉末比纖維容易均勻分散在高分子材料中，但是經由偶合劑改質過的粉末加入高分子材料中，其機械性質卻沒有明顯的提升，這是由於粉末的木質素結構與偶合劑之間只有微小的反應所致。在生物分解性試驗中，經由偶合劑N -  - (aminoethyl) -  - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane（Z 6020 ）改質的高分子材料，其生物分解性比加入未改質的植物纖維或粉末來得好，但是加入偶合劑-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane（Z 6040 ）的複合材料，其生物分解性明顯比加入未改質的植物纖維或粉末差。總體而言，以茭白筍外殼補強的高分子材料，其生物分解速率均有提升。且植物性纖維的有效運用也能降低生物分解性塑膠的成本、促進農業發展並減少農業廢棄物對於環境的負擔。目錄 一、序論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 生物分解高分子材料介紹	 1 二、文獻回顧	 7 2. 1 植物纖維補強材料	 7 2. 2 植物纖維簡介	 10 2. 3 偶合劑簡介	 14 2. 4 X光光電子能譜儀的應用	 17 2. 5 材料非等溫劣解動力學	 17 2. 6 研究動機	 18 三、實驗部份	 20 3. 1 實驗藥品	 20 3. 2 儀器設備	 21 3. 3 實驗步驟	 23 3. 3. 1 植物纖維的處理	 23 3. 3. 2 植物纖維改質	 23 3. 3. 3 生物分解性塑膠與纖維的混練過程	 25 3. 3. 4 生物分解性測試	 28 四、結果與討論	 29 4. 1 材料相容性及相互作用力探討 29 4. 1. 1 植物纖維利用矽烷偶合劑改質前後之FTIR化學結構鑑定	 29 4. 1. 2 XPS 表面化學結構分析	 31 4. 1. 3 Solid state of NMR 分析	 33 4. 1. 4 元素分析	 36 4. 1. 5 複合材料的SEM分析	 38 4. 2 複合材料的機械性質探討	 41 4. 2. 1 拉伸性質	 41 4. 2. 2 動態機械分析	 43 4. 3 複合材料的熱性質分析	 48 4. 3. 1 TGA 測試結果	 48 4. 3. 2 DSC 分析	 50 4. 3. 3 植物纖維及粉末之熱劣解動力學	 52 4. 3. 4 TGA-GC/Mass 分析	 53 4. 3. 5 絕熱式彈卡計	 61 4. 4 複合材料的生物分解性測試結果	 62 五、結論	 68 六、參考文獻	 69 七、附件-發表於SCI期刊之論文	 72 表目錄 Table 1 - 1 Bionolle與其他三種牌號之物理及機械性質整理表	 <b>4</b> <b>Table</b> 1 - 2 其他高分子的應用	 6 Table 2 - 1 台灣茭白筍主要產地	 11 Table 2 - 2 The chemical composition of lingnocellulosic fraction of coba husk	 12 Table 3 - 1 各試樣之成份重量比	 27 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 1 樣品代號F、FZ 6020 、FZ 6040 之軌域鍵結整理表	 31 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 2 13 C Chemical Shifts (ppm Relative to Me 4 Si) from the 22. 6 -MHz CP/MAS of Solid Cellulose Polymer	 34 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 3 纖維與粉末之元素分析	 37 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - <b>4</b> 各纖維的元素分析結果	 37 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 5 材料之tensile test property	 42 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 6 材料之modulus test property	 42 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 7 各試樣之DSC熔點及半高寬	 51 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 8 纖維在氮氣中 200 oC- 340 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析表	 54 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 9 纖維在氮氣中 340 oC- 600 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析表	 56 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 10 粉末在氮氣中 200 oC- 340 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析表	 58 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 11 粉末在氮氣中 340 oC- 600 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析表	 60 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - <b>12</b> 試樣之燃燒熱測定數據整理表	 61 <b>Table</b> <b>4</b> - 13 Biopolymer weight loss	 63 圖目錄 Figure 1 - 1 Polybutylene succinate結構圖	 5 Figure 2 - 1 植物纖維的cellulose結構	 12 Figure 2 - 2 植物纖維的lignin結構	 13 Figure 2 - 3 植物纖維的lignin結構	 14 Figure 2 - 4 矽烷水解、縮合與基材產生鍵結之示意圖	 16 Figure 3 - 1 改質後植物纖維之分析流程	 24 Figure 3 - 2 植物纖維補強高分子材料之分析流程	 26 Figure 4 - 1 改質前植物纖維與粉末之FT-IR分析圖	 30 Figure 4 - 2 經矽烷偶合劑改質後植物纖維之FT-IR分析圖	 30 Figure 4 - 3 樣品代號F、FZ 6020 、FZ 6040 之XPS全能譜圖	. 32 Figure 4 - 4 XPS樣品代號F、FZ 6020 、FZ 6040 之Si 2 s軌域鍵結	. 32 Figure 4 - 5 CelluloseІ 之結構示意圖	 33 Figure 4 - 6 文獻中各種Cellulose 結構固態 13 C-NMR圖譜	 34 Figure 4 - 7 13 C solid state NMR of Solid Cellulose Polymer	 35 Figure 4 - 8 29 Si solid state NMR of Solid Cellulose Polymer	 36 Figure 4 - 9 Bionolle放大 200 倍下的SEM	 38 Figure 4 - 10 Bionolle放大 5000 倍下的SEM	 39 Figure 4 - 11 BF 10 放大 2000 倍的SEM	 39 Figure <b>4</b> - <b>12</b> BF 10 Z 6020 放大 2000 倍的SEM	 40 Figure 4 - 13 BF 10 Z 6040 放大 2000 倍的SEM	 40 Figure 4 - 14 BP 10 放大 2000 倍的SEM	 41 Figure 4 - 15 未經偶合劑處理材料之loss modulus 分析圖	 44 Figure 4 - 16 含粉末材料之loss modulus 分析圖	 44 Figure 4 - 17 含纖維材料之loss modulus 分析圖	 45 Figure 4 - 18 未經偶合劑處理材料之storage modulus 分析圖	 45 Figure 4 - 19 含粉末材料之storage modulus分析圖	 46 Figure 4 - 20 含纖維材料之storage modulus分析圖	 46 Figure 4 - 21 未經偶合劑處理材料之Tan δ分析圖	 47 Figure 4 - 22 含粉末材料之Tan δ分析圖	 47 Figure 4 - 23 含纖維材料之Tan δ分析圖	 48 Figure 4 - 24 未處理的粉末及纖維之TGA分析	 49 Figure 4 - 25 材料之TGA分析	 49 Figure 4 - 26 各試樣在DSC下的熔點	 50 Figure 4 - 27 各試樣在DSC下的玻璃轉移溫度	 51 Figure 4 - 28 各轉化率下在不同氣體下之劣解活化能	 52 Figure 4 - 29 纖維在氮氣中 200 oC- 340 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析圖	 54 Figure 4 - 30 纖維在氮氣中 340 oC- 600 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析圖	 56 Figure 4 - 31 粉末在氮氣中 200 oC- 340 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析圖	 57 Figure 4 - 32 粉末在氮氣中 340 oC- 600 oC下之熱劣解質譜層析圖	 59 Figure 4 - 33 各試片未埋入堆肥中的照片	 64 Figure 4 - 34 各試片埋入堆肥中 45 天後的照片	 64 Figure 4 - 35 各試片埋入堆肥中 60 天後的照片	 64 Figure 4 - 36 各試片埋入堆肥中 75 天後的照片	 65 Figure 4 - 37 各試片埋入堆肥中 90 天後的照片	 65 Figure 4 - 38 (a) 未埋入堆肥中(b) 埋入堆肥中 90 天後的樣品	 66 Figure 4 - 39 (a) 未埋入堆肥中(b) 埋入堆肥中 90 天後的樣品	 6...|$|R

A higher order approximation for a percentage point of the noncentral t-distribution under normality is given by Akahira (1995) and is also shown to be numerically better than others. In this article, without the normality assumption, we obtain a higher order approximation to a percentage point {{of the distribution of}} a noncentral t-statistic, in a similar way to Akahira (1995) where the statistic based on a linear combination of a normal random variable and a chi-statistic takes an important role. Its application to the confidence limit and the confidence interval for a noncentrality parameter are also given. Further, a numerical comparison of the higher order approximation with the limiting normal distribution is done and the former one is shown to be more accurate. As a result of the numerical calculation, the higher order approximation seems to be useful in practical situations, when the size of sample is not so small.

40|$|We {{study by}} mean-field {{analysis}} and stochastic simulations chemical models for genetic toggle switches formed from pairs of genes that mutually repress each other. In {{order to determine}} the stability of the genetic switches, we make a connection with reactive flux theory and transition state theory. The switch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime τ. We find that τ grows exponentially with the mean number of transcription factor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct numerical simulations, the growth law is well characterised by τ∼^α(b), where α and b are parameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the noise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a protein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise), and fluctuations in the number of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against biochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription factor binding domains on the DNA such that competing transcription factors mutually exclude each other on the DNA. We also elucidate the origin of the enhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general switch: while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches, the `barrier' for flipping the switch is significantly higher for the exclusive switch than for the general switch.
