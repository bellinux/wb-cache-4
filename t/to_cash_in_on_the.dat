5|$|Dirty Duck {{received}} mostly negative reviews, {{with many}} criticizing it for its crude humor and others seeing {{the film as}} an attempt <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of Ralph Bakshi's Fritz the Cat.

5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did {{not sit well with}} the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E

5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> insurance on the slaves, thus not losing money on the slaves who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E

25|$|As mopane worms {{represent}} an important {{sector in the}} local rural economy, they attract {{large numbers of people}} who seek <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> profits from selling the insects as food.

In some areas, farmers and communities have taken steps to reach a balance, so that each year may yield maximum returns without compromising the following year's harvest.|$|E

Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on The FON Mixes the following year.

Some of these featured new remixes by other artists.|$|E

In 2006, GSN introduced High Stakes Poker, a poker show with a private game format among professional players, and also aired additional series World Series of Blackjack and a spinoff, Celebrity Blackjack. One {{of the most popular}} shows from the initial TV poker boom, the World Poker Tour, was slated to move from the Travel Channel to GSN on March 24, 2008. Within a year of GSN's revamp, it began returning its focus primarily to studio-based game shows.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{description}} of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but {{at a time when}} lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice may not have understood its imagery. Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book's reputation by raising the price from fifteen to fifty cents and pocketing the difference. Twenty years later she used him as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in Nightwood, caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.|$|E
25|$|From 1957-62, the Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association used Arden St to {{hold its}} Greyhound meetings. The dogs ran on a track that formed a {{perimeter}} around the oval. Races were held on Monday nights and regularly attracted crowds of 5000, with double that number in attendance on the night when Rookie Rebel won the first Australian Cup in 1958. The Arden Street days are described as being {{the best in the}} history of Melbourne greyhound racing. Melbourne Greyhound Racing Association shifted its meetings to Olympic Park in 1962 after the Arden Street's ground committee sought <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the dogs by doubling the rent.|$|E

25|$|Property {{prices have}} {{continued}} to rise steeply since {{the early years of}} the 21st century as property developers have moved <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.|$|E
25|$|By 1553, the Board of Ordnance in London had {{purchased}} more than 250 of Levett's guns. At a stroke, this English parson {{who had the}} armaments business thrust on him by {{death in the family}} had morphed into a full-blown entrepreneur. Iron casting and cannon-making became England's first modern industrial economy. Old landowning families like the Sidneys, the Carylls, the Coverts and the Gratwickes rushed <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boom, which lasted for more than two centuries. The wars of Henry VIII were good for business: the 20 blast furnaces and 28 forges in Sussex in 1549 more than doubled in 25 years to 50 furnaces and 60 forges. The secret was in the English method of vertical casting.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{building}} programme that also cleared the inner city slums, from the 1950s onwards, historic Georgian Dublin came under concerted attack by the Irish Government's development policies. Whole swathes of 18th-century houses were demolished, notably in Fitzwilliam Street and St Stephen's Green, to make way for utilitarian office blocks and government departments. Much of this development was fuelled by property developers and speculators keen <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buoyant property markets of the 1960s, late 1970s and 1980s. Many schemes were built by Government supporters with the intention of profitably letting to highly desirable State tenants such as government departments and State agencies. It has been proven that many buildings were approved by government ministers personally connected with the developers involved, often {{to the detriment of the}} taxpayer and the proper planning and preservation of Dublin city.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the 90-minute format was intended to be temporary, with the added time used to prepare a storyline for a spinoff, Texas in 1980. For upon its debut, the mother show contracted to 60 minutes again, this time moving to 2/1 Central, where it settled for the remaining 19 years of its run. Texas, starring the hugely popular Beverlee McKinsey and attempting <b>to</b> <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dallas craze, while itself not a success, may have caused further erosion of Another World viewership, {{to the point that it}} was no longer NBC's highest-rated serial, losing that position to Days of our Lives (which itself, along with the rest of NBC's daytime lineup, was in serious ratings trouble). Another World fell from eighth to as low as 11th in the ratings chart, and by the 1981–1982 television season it sunk so low in the Nielsens to 4.7 (a drop of 3.9 points in four seasons). Much like General Hospital winning the 3/2 slot for ABC, One Life to Live came in strong at 2/1, with CBS attempting to get its new Capitol off the ground during that period.|$|E
