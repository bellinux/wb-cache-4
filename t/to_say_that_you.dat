500|$|Though {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy was {{reluctant}} to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's tenth episode, he returned for the season finale when the producers [...] "essentially called him up and pleaded". They discussed their plans for the character, and [...] "told him {{it was a story}} we couldn't tell without him." [...] He [...] "graciously agreed." [...] "Over There" [...] marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe, a longer and [...] "much more involv" [...] shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, [...] "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." [...] Wyman elaborated that [...] "I think it's fair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not experienced the last of William Bell". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide".|$|E
500|$|... "Here I Stand" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Polow da Don, Adam Blackstone and Gerrell Gaddis, as well as Dre & Vidal, who also {{produced}} the track. The song was recorded by Vincent Dilorenzo, with assistance from Geoff Rice, at Sony Music Studios, New York City and Zac Recording, Atlanta. Dilorenzo also mixed the record, with assistance from Matt DeSando, at Studio 609, Philadelphia. According to Josh Eells of Blender, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was written for Tameka Foster, whom Usher married in August 2007. Composed before their engagement, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was played at Usher and Foster's wedding, on Foster's request. The tune is an assurance of sexual fidelity and commitment. In an interview with MTV News, Usher stated, [...] "If {{you listen to the}} words , it is very heartfelt, simplistic, yet very soulful. ... It's a man's words to his woman: a vow <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the one, and I'll be there for you." [...] A slow jam soul ballad, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] has been compared to the work of Stevie Wonder by critics. It was included on Usher's fifth studio album of the same name, released on May 13, 2008 by LaFace Records.|$|E

2500|$|On November 24, 2010, {{the day of}} the film's release, {{directors}} Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed {{reports that}} the title change was a marketing decision.

They went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot call Toy Story [...] "Buzz Lightyear," [...] and they really needed a title that represented what the film is, and that it's a duo, and it stars Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.|$|E

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{the commitment of}} more than 20,000 additional troops {{as a part of}} the Iraqi troop surge of 2007. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the [...] "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and said, [...] "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. Do I believe it can succeed? Yes, I do." [...] On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a [...] "vote of no confidence" [...] in the US military. The next day, McCain said, [...] "I don't think it's appropriate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> disapprove of a mission and you don't want to fund it and you don't want it to go, but yet you don't take the action necessary to prevent it".|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, McCain {{announced}} that he supported the inclusion of intelligent design teaching in schools. He told the Arizona Daily Star that, [...] "I think {{that there has to}} be all points of view presented. But they've got to be thoroughly presented. So <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can only teach one line of thinking … or one belief on how people and the world was created I think there's nothing wrong with teaching different schools of thought." [...] In 2006 he seemed to back off the position a bit, saying, [...] "Should [...] be taught as a science class? Probably not." [...] McCain's 2005 book Character Is Destiny had included a highly complimentary chapter on Charles Darwin, in which McCain wrote, [...] "Darwin helped explain nature's laws. He did not speculate, in his published theories at least, on the origin of life. The only undeniable challenge the theory of evolution poses to Christian beliefs is its obvious contradiction of the idea that God created the world as it is in less than a week." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005. Gillespie scribbled over this and wrote [...] "Make Israel History." [...] Gillespie later {{said that he did}} this in support of Palestine, and when questioned on whether he was anti-Semitic, he responded [...] "There's Israeli and Jewish people who support the Palestinian cause as well. We did a lot of work for the Hoping Foundation to raise money for children in the Palestinian refugee camps and the lady who got us involved is Bella Freud, Lucian Freud's daughter and Sigmund Freud's great granddaughter. They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most people are just trying hard to get by." [...] In 2012 he stated that he believed the British coalition government were reactionary quasi-fascists. The statement was prompted by the use of Primal Scream's song [...] "Rocks" [...] at the Conservative Party Conference.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E
