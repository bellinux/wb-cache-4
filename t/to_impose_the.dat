5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E

5|$|The war effort, debilitated by {{a rebellious}} {{confederation}} {{established by the}} unpaid military, was continued. Turkey, threatened by the Polish territorial gains became involved at the frontiers, and a peace between Russia and Sweden was agreed to in 1617. Fearing the new alliance the Commonwealth undertook one more major expedition, which took over Vyazma and arrived at the walls of Moscow, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> rule of Władysław Vasa again. The city would not open its gates and not enough military strength {{was brought in to}} attempt a forced take-over.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a High Court Judge), to study law, Choor Singh enrolled as an external {{student at the}} University of London, passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination. In 1948 he was appointed a coroner, and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. Following law studies at Gray's Inn on a government scholarship, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963. Especially noted for his criminal judgments, Singh was the first Singapore judge <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> death penalty on a woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{archbishop}} {{swore to}} Henry I {{that he would}} support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22December 1135. He was persuaded {{to do so by}} Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.|$|E

5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E
5|$|Burnell {{was active}} in the king's foreign policy, {{especially}} towards France, Scotland and Wales, and undertook a number of diplomatic missions to those countries. Burnell served as the royal spokesman on several of these occasions, one of them being at Paris in 1286 when he made a speech detailing the history of English–French relations since the Treaty of Paris of 1259. The speech was a prelude to discussions, successfully concluded, involving the homage that Edward owed to King Philip IV of France, for Edward's land in France. Burnell was employed in Gascony during the late 1280s, helping to administer that duchy and to reorganise its government. He showed himself sensitive to the Gascon desire for independence and did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> same systems of government that were used in England. The historian Michael Prestwich therefore argues that the first half of Edward's reign was the period when Gascony enjoyed its most successful government under the Plantagenets. Later, in June 1291, Burnell gave two speeches at the great council of English and Scottish nobles in Norham to decide the succession to the Scottish crown. Edward had been asked to mediate an end to the crisis over the succession, or the Great Cause as it was known in England.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše began <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> {{new laws}} on the Serb {{population}} of the NDH. On 28 May, a group of ten young Ustaše students from the University of Zagreb arrived in Trebinje and began removing signs written in the Cyrillic script used by Serbs. On 1 June, in several towns and villages in eastern Herzegovina, Serbs were shot and businesses belonging to Serb merchants and others were seized. On that day, the Ustaše students in Trebinje shot nine Serbs and arrested another fifteen, apparently due to their links to the inter-war Chetnik Association. Differences began to appear between the brutal treatment of Serbs by the Ustaše and the more careful approach of the other NDH authorities such as the Home Guard, who {{were aware of the}} potential danger created by Ustaše methods. In early June, the NDH authorities began operations to confiscate weapons from the population, meeting with immediate resistance. On 1 June, the residents of the village of Donji Drežanj, near Nevesinje, refused to co-operate with weapons collectors. In response, the Ustaše killed a number of Serbs and burned their homes.|$|E

30|$|Thus, R(C, D, F) is the {{so-called}} orthogonal matrix. In this case, transforming the local coordinate into the global one is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>imposing</b> <b>the</b> transposition/inversion {{with respect to the}} above rotation matrix. If we model the conformal array based on the Euler angle, three matrix multiplications and one matrix transposition are required for each element.|$|R
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>the</b> punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
