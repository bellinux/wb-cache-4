500|$|Due to the {{intricate}} designs of the Transformers, {{even the simplest}} motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts; each of Ironhide's guns are made of ten thousand parts. Bumblebee uses a piece below his face-plate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten. According to Bay, [...] "The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement"; that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities. Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look [...] "cool", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on {{how much of the}} environment was reflecting on their bodies. Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.|$|E

2500|$|As {{construction}} neared on the Forrestal Building, {{there were}} {{serious concerns about}} the construction schedule. [...] Zeckendorf noted that work could not begin on the esplanade until the building was finished, and the esplanade was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> the office buildings at L'Enfant Plaza desirable to tenants. [...] By May 1965, {{the cost of the}} structure had risen to $46 million. (A different report in June put the price at $30 to $32 million.) GSA asked for construction bids that same month, and Blake Construction won the contract in July. Excavation work began in September, and was well under way by October. In early January 1966, the Washington Post reported that the structure was due to be complete by the end of 1967. But the federal government was a year behind in its construction schedule by June 1967, causing the northern end of the promenade to remain incomplete. A consultant blamed over-optimistic construction schedules and a labor shortage for the problems. The building finally neared completion in April 1969.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} came in 1868. On March 4, 1867, John D. Rockefeller, his brother William Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and {{businessman}} Henry Flagler formed the oil refining firm of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler. (Flagler's step-brother, the liquor magnate Stephen V. Harkness, was a silent partner.) Transportation costs were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> oil cheaply available to consumers, and cheap oil meant more market share (and more profit). For Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, {{the question was}} how to get its refined oil to East Coast cities. At the time, the railroads were engaged in cutthroat competition for refined oil. Rate-cutting was common (with railways often losing money on shipments). Each road also attempted to win more oil freight business by rapidly building up its supply of tank cars, but this left the railroads with an oversupply of cars, which lost them even more money. In 1868, Rockefeller formed a consortium of Cleveland-area refining companies. The consortium agreed to pool their shipments to the East Coast if lower freight rates could be procured. On behalf of the consortium, Henry Flagler reached an agreement with Stone's Lake Shore & Michigan Southern: The consortium would guarantee at least 60 tank cars of refined oil every day, in return for which the LS would cut shipping rates by 30 percent (e.g., offer a [...] "rebate"). The consortium agreed not to ship oil with any other railway unless the LS could not take the oil, and the LS agreed not to offer a rebate to any other refiners unless they could provide at least 60 tank cars {{of oil a day}} (which none of them could). Stone quickly agreed to the plan, which greatly enhanced Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler's market share.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues of {{teaching}} computer programming is concerned with determining pedagogical {{factors that contribute to}} students' learning and instructional improvement. Classroom teachers are <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> learning happen as well as improving teaching in schools. Teachers' perspectives on teaching affect how teachers perceive the nature of the subject, the problems of instruction and how they adopt solutions or ways to improve instruction. Teachers' views of knowledge have great impact on teachers' perspectives and their pedagogical practices. Over the years, two predominant computational theories of mind have emerged from the study of artificial intelligence, namely, the symbolic and the connectionist models. In this article, I argue, based on a qualitative study of 12 computer studies teachers in Hong Kong, that the connectionist view provides an alternative way of thinking about understanding and knowledge which leads to better insight on teaching and facilitates pedagogical change. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|Solar thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems offer a {{distinct}} approach for converting sunlight into electricity [1 – 6]. Compared to standard photovoltaics, sunlight is not absorbed directly by a photovoltaic material, but is instead absorbed by a selective absorber. That selective absorber is thermally coupled to a selective emitter, which then thermally radiates electromagnetic radiation. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> challenge <b>to</b> <b>making</b> {{such a system}} efficient is achieving a relatively high temperature.
