5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} {{and political}} scientist, surprised many by coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> sociobiology {{on the grounds}} that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders should know what human needs were in order to build a better society.|$|E
5|$|Preparations {{for the war}} {{dominated}} Shelby's second term. Two {{days before}} his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of Indiana and Illinois, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Problems rose soon {{already in}} the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and {{frequently}} clashed with King Thomas, seized a border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide his territory between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{supported}} some LGBT rights. He {{voted to}} prohibit job {{discrimination based on}} sexual orientation, and was a co-sponsor of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Specter was opposed to same-sex marriage, but was also opposed to a federal ban and supported civil unions. He also became opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> Marriage Act which he once supported. Specter {{voted in favor of}} repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell in the lame-duck session of the 111th Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry divisions were assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> this area. Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American invasion of Iwo Jima was interpreted {{as evidence that the}} Hong Kong-Canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta army {{consisted}} of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was always ready for {{war in a}} cantonment (Sthirabhuta Kataka) in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the empire in case of war.

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|At Final Resolution, {{the team}} of Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks fought {{the team of}} Booker T and Sharmell. The storyline behind this {{encounter}} involved Sharmell coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Roode's manager Ms. Brooks, who Roode verbally abused on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds. TNA promoted a match between Booker T and Robert Roode heading into Against All Odds.|$|E
50|$|In 1862, Brooks {{became a}} {{superintendent}} of the recruiting service and was transferred to Ohio. On August 1, 1863, {{he was promoted to}} colonel and placed in command of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment. The regiment was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, D.C..

50|$|In the Battle of the Wilderness, Hardaway {{commanded}} his battalion in {{the corps}} of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell in {{the portion of the}} artillery contingent led by Col. J. Thompson Brown. The battalion continued in that corps throughout the Overland Campaign. Hardaway’s guns were in the second line of Ewell’s corps at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, but some of them were moved up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line of a gorge <b>to</b> contain <b>the</b> federal breakthrough on May 11. When the corps, led by Jubal Early left to defend Lynchburg, Virginia, Hardaway’s battalion remained behind. It was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Richmond, Virginia, reporting to Brig. Gen. Edward Porter Alexander. The battalion {{played a role in the}} Battle of Chaffin's Farm and spent much of late 1864 assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Chaffin's Bluff.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In {{the first of his}} five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, {{after the fall of}} France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. News of a {{breakthrough}} at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> their homeland, {{in order to prevent}} a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 911 September, the British {{launched}} several air strikes on Messina, and Gorizia contributed her anti-aircraft batteries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the port. Later in the month, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering {{the strength of the}} British escort force. On 29 September, upon returning from the failed attempt to disrupt Operation Halberd, Gorizia was sent to operate from La Maddalena, though she returned to Messina on 10 October. An Allied air attack on the port on 21 November caused extensive damage to Gorizias superstructure from bomb splinters, though she nevertheless sortied that day to escort another convoy to North Africa. On 16 and 17 December, while on another convoy escort mission, she took part in the First Battle of Sirte against a force of British light cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubids {{generally}} employed Kurds, Turks, {{and people}} from the Caucasus for the higher-ranking posts {{of the military and}} bureaucratic fields. Not much is known about the foot soldiers of the Ayyubid army, but the numbers of cavalrymen are known to have fluctuated between 8,500 and 12,000. The cavalry was largely composed of free-born Kurds, Turks, and Turkomans whom Ayyubid emirs and sultans purchased as slaves (mamluks). In addition, there existed Arab auxiliaries, former Fatimid units such as the Nubians, and separate Arab contingents—notably from the Kinaniyya tribe, who were largely devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Egypt. Rivalry between Kurdish and Turkish troops occurred occasionally when leading positions were at stake and towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Turks outnumbered Kurds in the army. Despite their Kurdish background, the sultans remained impartial to both groups.|$|E
50|$|Following a loss at the Battle of Gravelotte, the French Army of <b>the</b> Rhine retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Metz. Given their {{fortified}} entrenchment, the Prussians readily encircled {{the position}} and laid siege. The army {{would be forced to}} surrender two months later, but not before a doomed attempt by Napoleon III <b>to</b> rescue <b>the</b> Army of the Rhine.|$|R
50|$|The battery {{participated in}} the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg. It served on an {{expedition}} to Reams Station before leaving the Petersburg front. On July 10, 1864 Stevens' battery was sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, D. C.. The battery served in VI Corps operations as far as Harpers Ferry, West Virginia for the remainder of July.|$|R
50|$|When {{the corps}} {{formerly}} led by Ewell and Early returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Petersburg, Virginia with Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon as its commander, Hardaway’s battalion returned to that corps. Hardaway’s gunners served under Gordon in the Appomattox Campaign, firing {{one of the}} last shots before Lee’s surrender. Hardaway was paroled on May 10, 1865.|$|R
5|$|The French had {{committed}} 10,800 troops, with more reinforcements totaling nearly 16,000 men, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily wooded hills {{that had not}} been secured. Artillery as well as ten M24 Chaffee light tanks and numerous aircraft were committed to the garrison. The garrison included French regular troops (notably elite paratroop units plus artillery), Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan tirailleurs, and locally recruited Indochinese infantry. All told, the Viet Minh had moved 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the valley, totaling five divisions including the 351st Heavy Division, which was made up entirely of heavy artillery. Artillery and antiaircraft guns, which outnumbered the French artillery by about four to one, were moved into positions overlooking the valley. The French came under direct and sporadic Viet Minh artillery fire {{for the first time on}} 31 January 1954, and patrols encountered the Viet Minh in all directions. The French were surrounded.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{outdated}} {{but remained}} vital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Kraków, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex {{at the turn}} of the 15th century. During the reconstruction, the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added. A century and a half later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect , who built the New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's starosta community.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{attempt by}} I Corps {{to reach the}} city on D-Day was blocked by {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division and with the Germans committing most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Caen, the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of Second Army's objectives. Operation Perch in the week following D-Day and Operation Epsom (26–30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but Caen remained in German hands until Operation Charnwood (7–9 July), when the Second Army managed to take {{the northern part of}} the city up to the River Orne in a frontal assault.|$|E
50|$|Although McClellan {{claimed a}} Union victory in his reports, {{and he took}} the Williamsburg Line within {{slightly}} more than 24 hours, most historians rate the Battle of Williamsburg as a Confederate victory. The Williamsburg Line had served its intended purpose. The primary goal of the defenders had been <b>to</b> enable <b>the</b> retreat of the main Confederate force <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Richmond, and this was accomplished.|$|R
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{was assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Columbus, Kentucky, then to Island No. 10.
