5|$|A {{completely}} new station was also added to <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> traffic mitigation {{as part of}} the reconstruction of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. On June 7, 2002, State Street Station was opened in New Haven to provide better access to the downtown area than Union Station, which is half a mile away from the business district.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> which they were designed was crucial {{in the decision to}} withdraw the entire class.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the route}} from Brill to Oxford had not begun. Further Acts of Parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894 varying the route {{slightly}} and allowing electrification, but no building was carried out other than surveying. On 1 April 1894, the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Wotton Tramway. Jones was retained as general Manager and work began on upgrading <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the extension.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was between Rey Mysterio and Finlay, voted by the fans to be a Stretcher match. Finlay managed to {{retrieve}} his shillelagh and attacked Mysterio's legs.

5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last {{riders to}} leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds better at <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification.

5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for}} the losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{went into}} {{the final day of}} the {{competition}} knowing a draw was enough to win the Emirates Cup. Alexandre Lacazette started for Arsenal, as did Mesut Özil, while Ben Yedder continued to lead <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> Sevilla in a front three – either side of Nolito and Joaquín Correa. After an uneventful first half which saw both sides create few chances, Sevilla took the lead when Ben Yedder's reverse ball found an incoming Correa who slotted the ball past Petr Čech. Lacazette equalised for Arsenal, but the hosts went behind again after Steven N'Zonzi's long shot looped into the far top corner. Sevilla held on to win, but despite a 100% record they finished second because Arsenal's points and goal difference was identical to theirs, and the Spanish club had scored fewer goals over the two days.|$|E
5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, {{and it is not}} possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> operation.|$|E

5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E
5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> £35,944, £11,000 {{less than}} the original estimate. He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two bogie open wagons and one bogie van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter wagons, designed to transport standard-gauge wagons. Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where the wagons could be placed. The use of transporter wagons eliminated transshipment, and removed the need for large numbers of goods wagons.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the battalions of the Australian Corps {{were removed}} from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> rest on 5 October, after a request from the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. They had been {{severely}} depleted and were suffering from acute manpower shortages {{as a result of}} the combination of a decrease in the number of volunteers from Australia and the decision to grant home leave to men who had served for over four years. Subsequently, when the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, the Australian Corps had not returned to the front and was still in the rear reorganising and training. With the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began, and men were slowly repatriated back to Australia. The process took a considerable period of time, though, and a large number of men were able to undertake tertiary and vocational training in England and France to prepare for their return to civilian life. Finally, as numbers dwindled, the battalion was disbanded on 4 June 1919.|$|E

The platforms are connected by two transfer concourses, one elevated and one underground. The east gate connects directly to platform 6 while the west gate connects directly to platform 1. Several shops and restaurants serving transferring passengers are located inside the station.|$|R
5|$|Hautpoult {{had fought}} hard during the {{engagement}} and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee {{and the newly}} captured French ship back to port, promoting Napier to command the ship of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> his service on Recruit and despatching York and Captain to hunt for Troude's remaining squadron. Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

Then, on a fake run, {{he threw a}} pass to Bomar, who was alone behind the defense and ran {{the rest of the}} way for a touchdown. Kuhn featured in a second-quarter scoring drive, completing a 10-yard pass to Scotty Neill inside the five-yard line and faking his way through <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown. The Commodores won, 26–0; Kuhn was selected as an All-American by Billy Evans and received an honorable mention on Walter Camp's team. Kuhn and Centre's Flash Covington were the two quarterbacks from Evans' All-Southern team to receive Camp's mention. At the December 5, 1922 Vanderbilt football banquet, he was elected Commodore captain for the following season.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{regiment}} regained battalion strength {{in preparation for}} the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still with the 29th British Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was situated near the northern end of the 45-kilometre front being assaulted by the joint French and British force. The attack, originally scheduled for 29 June 1916 was postponed by two days to July 1, 1916, partly on account of inclement weather, partly to allow more time for the artillery preparation. The 29th British Division, with its three infantry brigades faced defences manned by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Wurttemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been involved in the invasion of France in August 1914 and had been manning the Beaumont-Hamel section of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> nearly 20 months prior to the battle. The German troops were spending a great deal of their time not only training but fortifying their position, including the construction of numerous deep dugouts and at least two tunnels.|$|E

5|$|In March and April 1918, the {{battalion}} {{took part in}} the defensive actions in response to the German spring offensive, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The 6th Battalion joined the advance the following day, striking out from Villers-Bretonneux and taking part in the capture of Lihons. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, taking part in the advance towards Herleville, but was then withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> rest and reorganisation and did not see any further combat. In November, the members of {{the battalion}} began being repatriated back to Australia as the demobilisation process began. The process was undertaken gradually based upon length of service and as the battalion's numbers began to dwindle it was amalgamated with the 7th Battalion in March 1919. Later, this battalion was also amalgamated with the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In late February, the Japanese forces around Mosigetta withdrew after {{pressure}} from Captain Ted Hutchinson's company in an action {{for which he}} was later awarded the Military Cross. The 61st Battalion, after establishing its headquarters at Mosigetta, continued its advance alongside the 25th Battalion. After the 25th Battalion crossed the Puriata, a patrol from the 61st strove for the Hari where they clashed with a group of between 15 and 20 Japanese holding an entrenched position. Upon establishing contact, the patrol's artillery forward observation officer called down indirect fire from the supporting artillery battery and as the patrol assaulted the position, the Japanese defenders withdrew, leaving six of their dead behind. The position was subsequently revealed to consist of four main pits and 20 other smaller ones. After this engagement the battalion was withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> a brief period due to concerns about its morale {{while the rest of the}} 7th Brigade continued the advance along the Buin road throughout February and into March.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E
