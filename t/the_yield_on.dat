The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend yield on a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend yield on all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the bidder’s shares, {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover.

The {{objective of this}} thesis is to assess the effects of foliage application of magnesium sulfate and urea for potatoes, that are intended for processing into starch production. There were two sorts of potatoes with different vegetation period under study, an early variety called as Bernard and semi-late variety called as Ornella. The foliage fertilizers were applied in three different variants. In the first variant the sorts of potatoes were fertilized by solution of magnesium sulfate, in the second variant by solution of urea and in the third variant the solution of magnesium sulfate and urea was used. The assessment of the experiment consists of <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> tubers, contain of <b>the</b> starch, <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> starch, <b>the</b> average amount of tubers per tuft, the average weight of tubers and profitability of used foliage fertilizers.

2500|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{assumes that}} the various maturities are perfect substitutes and suggests that {{the shape of the}} yield curve depends on market participants' expectations of future interest rates. [...] It assumes that market forces will cause the interest rates on various terms of bonds to be such that the expected final value of a sequence of short-term investments will equal the known final value of a single long-term investment. If this did not hold, the theory assumes that investors would quickly demand more of the current short-term or long-term bonds (whichever gives the higher expected long-term yield), and this would drive down the return on current bonds of that term and drive up <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> current bonds of the other term, so as to quickly make the assumed equality of expected returns of the two investment approaches hold.|$|E
