25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles {{for the sake of}} puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E

Kumar of The Times of India also gave the film three out of five stars: [...] "The attempt at political satire in this film is feeble, mindless and boring.

2500|$|Let me <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the winter}} of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place {{of work in the}} City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E
