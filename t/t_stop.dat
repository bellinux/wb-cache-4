He seemed very disappointed in the state of things and thought the cause of [...] "dust on all of the books" [...] was due to the withering collective's distance from the heart of Boston. Putting his house up on loan, Katsiaficas rented a brand new storefront just outside the Central <b>T</b> <b>stop</b> in Central Square in Cambridge. Within the first day, all of the books on black history were sold. The collective was revived. After the year lease of the location, the collective's name was changed to the Lucy Parsons Center and moved to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} {{activity is}} essential for replication, recombination, repair, and mutagenesis. All DNA polymerases studied so far from any biological source synthesize DNA by the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule, incorporating A, G, C, and T opposite the templates T, C, G, and A, respectively. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs would lead to mutations. In this report, we describe the ninth human DNA polymerase, Polι, encoded by the RAD 30 B gene. We show that human Polι violates the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule opposite template T. During base selection, human Polι preferred T-G base pairing, leading to G incorporation opposite template T. The resulting T-G base pair was less efficiently extended by human Polι compared to the Watson-Crick base pairs. Consequently, DNA synthesis frequently aborted opposite template T, a property we designated the <b>T</b> <b>stop.</b> This <b>T</b> <b>stop</b> restricted human Polι to a very short stretch of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, kinetic analyses show that human Polι copies template C with extraordinarily low fidelity, misincorporating T, A, and C with unprecedented frequencies of 1 / 9, 1 / 10, and 1 / 11, respectively. Human Polι incorporated one nucleotide opposite a template abasic site more efficiently than opposite a template T, suggesting a role for human Polι in DNA lesion bypass. The unique features of preferential G incorporation opposite template T and <b>T</b> <b>stop</b> suggest that DNA Polι may additionally play a specialized function in human biology...|$|E
