5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E

25|$|The {{two large}} balls were {{positioned}} on alternate {{sides of the}} horizontal wooden arm of the balance. Their mutual attraction to the small balls caused the arm to rotate, twisting the wire supporting the arm. The arm stopped rotating when it reached an angle where <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> force of the wire balanced the combined gravitational force of attraction between the large and small lead spheres. By measuring {{the angle of the}} rod and knowing <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> force (torque) of the wire for a given angle, Cavendish was able to determine the force between the pairs of masses. Since the gravitational force of the Earth on the small ball could be measured directly by weighing it, the ratio of the two forces allowed the density of the Earth to be calculated, using Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E
25|$|Wing warping {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> {{motion of the}} wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, {{came up with the}} idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.|$|E

25|$|To {{find the}} wire's torsion coefficient, the torque exerted by the wire {{for a given}} angle of twist, Cavendish timed the natural {{oscillation}} period of the balance rod as it rotated slowly clockwise and counterclockwise against <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> of the wire. The period was about 20 minutes. The torsion coefficient could be calculated from this and the mass and dimensions of the balance. Actually, the rod was never at rest; Cavendish had to measure the deflection angle of the rod while it was oscillating.|$|E

40|$|Let E be a flat complex vector bundle over {{a closed}} {{oriented}} odd dimensional manifold M endowed {{with a flat}} connection ∇. The refined analytic torsion for (M,E) was defined and studied by Braverman and Kappeler. Recently Mathai and Wu defined and studied the analytic torsion for <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex with an odd degree closed differential form H, other than one form, as a flux and with coefficients in E. In this paper we generalize {{the construction of the}} refined analytic torsion to <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex. We show that the refined analytic torsion of <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> de Rham complex is independent of the choice of the Riemannian metric on M and the Hermitian metric on E. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion is invariant (under a natural identification) if H is deformed within its cohomology class. We prove a duality theorem, establishing a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion corresponding to a flat connection and its dual. We also define <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> analogue of <b>the</b> Ray-Singer metric and calculate <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> Ray-Singer metric of <b>the</b> <b>twisted</b> refined analytic torsion.

25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

25|$|Bowling {{actions are}} {{typically}} divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands {{parallel to the}} bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This {{is not to be}} confused with a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> of the back inherent in the action.|$|E

25|$|The stomach twists {{around the}} {{longitudinal}} {{axis of the}} digestive tract, also known as volvulus. Gas distension may occur prior to or after the stomach twists. The most common direction for rotation is clockwise, viewing the animal from behind. The stomach can rotate up to 360° in this direction and 90° counterclockwise. If the volvulus is greater than 180°, the esophagus is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or vomiting. The results of this distortion of normal anatomy and gas distension include hypotension (low blood pressure), decreased return of blood to the heart, ischemia (loss of blood supply) of the stomach, and shock. Pressure on the portal vein decreases blood flow to liver and decreases the ability of that organ to remove toxins and absorbed bacteria from the blood. At {{the other end of}} the stomach, the spleen may be damaged if <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> interrupts its blood supply.
