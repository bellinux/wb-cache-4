5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|As a {{preliminary}} step towards the AC-47 Spooky gunship program (retroactively Gunship I), under Project Tailchaser C-131B Samaritan, 53-7820, {{was given a}} gunsight for <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window,</b> but instead of guns it had cameras in the cargo area. In 1964 the C-131 was ferried to Eglin AFB and a General Electric SUU-11A/A 7.62mm Gatling-style Minigun was installed. Live ammunition was used and both over-water and over-land tests in late summer were successful. A C-47 was subsequently fitted with three Miniguns and side-firing tests began in September 1964. The initial combat operation of the FC-47, as it was initially officially named, began in Vietnam on 15 December 1964.|$|E

2500|$|During the coking process, {{a laborer}} would level the {{deposited}} coal through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> using a scaper. [...] Once the coal was ready, <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> would be sealed with clay, leaving a [...] opening {{to allow the}} entry of air. [...] The process, which essentially involves heating bituminous coal in a closed chamber to remove its volatile material, took about 72 hours. [...] At {{the end of the}} process, the clay seal was broken, and the coke was removed and placed on a train for shipment to an iron furnace in Chattanooga. [...] Two tons of coal typically produced one ton of coke.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Rambler American was achieved through a heavy restyling {{of the previous}} year's model under AMC's styling Vice President Edmund E. Anderson. While mechanically identical to the 1960 model, Anderson's restyle resulted in a car that was three inches (76mm) narrower and shorter in its exterior dimensions with an overall length of , but increased in its cargo capacity. Continuing to ride on the [...] wheelbase, the American's new styling was more square (sometimes described as [...] "breadbox") instead of the round [...] "roly-poly" [...] shape (or [...] "bathtub"), and the visual connection with the original 1950 Nash model had finally disappeared. Popular Mechanics wrote [...] "seldom has a car been completely restyled as the 1961 Rambler American and yet retain the same engine, driveline, suspension on the same unit body". All outside sheet metal was changed, but <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> frames remained the same as previous models. Only the back glass changed {{to conform to the}} new roof line. The firewall and dash board were new stampings, with the clutch and brake pedals moved from under the floor to the firewall.|$|E
2500|$|The E.214, which {{appeared}} in about 1936 or 1937 was essentially an E.114 with a 56kW (75hp) Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine. The structure {{was the same as}} that of the E.114 and the wings had the same dimensions. [...] With a length of 7.15m (23ft5½in), the E.214 was a few [...] millimetres longer than the E.114M, despite the latter's much longer engine and the extension provided space for a second pair of seats behind the first, making the E.214 a four-seater. The new seats were accessed via a side door, though the front pair retained <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> route of the earlier aircraft. A trim tab on the elevator replaced the elastic rope balance and the undercarriage was also new, each side having an oleo leg fixed to the lower fuselage longeron and braced at its lower end [...] by a V-form strut, hinged on the fuselage centreline. [...] At 420kg (926lb), its empty weight was close to that of the E.114M. [...] Maximum speed was 170km/h (106mph).|$|E

Optional was the two-barrel carburetor version that generates [...] at 4400 rpm. Chevrolet's new 4.3 liter (262 cid) V8 engine was optional. The smallest V8 ever offered by Chevrolet, it features a Rochester two-barrel carburetor and generates [...] at 3600 rpm.

The basic design was also incorporated into GM's third and fourth generation F-bodies, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird.|$|E
2500|$|By 5pm, the {{authorities}} had not delivered {{any amount of}} fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected {{the youngest member of}} the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an atheist. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying [...] "I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.". Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the Quran on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but [...] "nothing like what seemed to be about to happen." [...] French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.|$|E

50|$|During its production, the Gillig Low Floor {{has seen}} {{revisions}} to its body design. In 2002, the windshield was enlarged (along {{with the use}} of a smaller destination sign) and <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> were reduced in width (after 2003, <b>the</b> rear <b>side</b> split <b>windows</b> that were configured upside down after the revisions, were reconfigured to match the rest of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> with split openings; later models featured frameless windows as optional with or without split openings). In 2008, the glass of both entry doors was enlarged (distinguished by squared-off corners). A suburban configuration was added, identified externally by the lack of a rear entry door. In place of transit seating, the configuration is equipped with forward-facing seating, internal luggage racks, onboard Wi-Fi, and other passenger-related options.|$|R
