5|$|Such was the {{controversy}} surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot {{as part of their}} new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> Dot Cotton's character is guilty of murder. The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies textbooks.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, British troops {{moved from}} Long Island to occupy Montresor's Island, {{a small island}} {{at the mouth of}} the Harlem River. One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, postpone the impending British attack, allowing Washington more time <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> and where to confront the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held {{that it was not}} necessary for it <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E

5|$|The refugee {{controversy}} in Sjöbo, Sweden, {{refers to the}} surrounding events of the 1988 referendum that banned Sjöbo Municipality from admitting foreign refugees. In 1987, despite opposition and demonstrations, local Centre Party politician Sven-Olle Olsson (1929–2005), who was Sjöbo's municipal commissioner at the time, was successful in gaining {{the support of the}} Sjöbo municipal assembly to hold a referendum <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> Sjöbo should ban the acceptance of foreign refugees. The controversial referendum passed with a 67.4% majority for the ban in 1988, gaining Olsson and Sjöbo much publicity in the Swedish media. The outcome was heavily criticized by Swedish media and politicians (including then-Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson).|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> persons should {{be deprived of}} their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|The ship can {{be moved}} {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a set number of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E

5|$|Åland is a {{collection}} of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and Finland. The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with Finland, were taken by Imperial Russia. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands {{to be a part of}} their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland, formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.|$|E

5000|$|The conjugacy {{problem was}} {{identified}} by Max Dehn in 1911 {{as one of}} the fundamental decision problems in group theory; the other two being the word problem and the isomorphism problem. The conjugacy problem contains the word problem as a special case: if x and y are words, <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> they are the same word is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> [...] is the identity, which is the same as <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> it's conjugate <b>to</b> the identity. In 1912 Dehn gave an algorithm that solves both the word and conjugacy problem for the fundamental groups of closed orientable two-dimensional manifolds of genus {{greater than or equal to}} 2 (the genus 0 and genus 1 cases being trivial).|$|R
40|$|Much work on {{argument}} {{systems has}} focussed on preferred extensions which define the maximal collectively defensible subsets.

40|$|Entanglement is at {{the heart}} of most quantum {{information}} tasks, and therefore considerable effort has been made to find methods of deciding the entanglement content of a given bipartite quantum state. Here, we prove a fundamental limitation <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> an unknown state is entangled or not: we show that any quantum measurement which can answer this question for an arbitrary state necessarily gives enough information to identify the state completely. We also extend our treatment to other classes of correlated states by considering the problem of <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> a state has negative partial transpose, is discordant, or is fully classically correlated. Remarkably, only the question related to quantum discord can be answered without resorting to full state tomography...|$|R
