5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, appears {{from the fact that}} Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{said in his}} {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the limited}} tenure of his {{fellowship}} {{it was necessary to}} choose a profession; like De Morgan, Cayley chose law, and at age 25 entered at Lincoln's Inn, London.

He was of Greek descent; his grandfather, who had {{migrated}} from Athens to Rome, finally settled at Augustodunum as a teacher of rhetoric. Eumenius probably took his fathers place, for it was from Augustodunum <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> be magister memoriae (private secretary) to the emperor Constantius Chlorus, whom he accompanied on several of his campaigns.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} Georgian {{survivors}} of the uprising died in July 2007 and was buried with military honors in Zugdidi, Georgia.

He was captured by security forces in downtown Gaziantep on 3 March 2014 as he was fleeing from {{the house of a}} friend of his.

The following year he was admitted into the Washington, D.C. bar association.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, Zach Adams was {{the first}} to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other {{forensic}} evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body {{in the back of his}} truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.|$|E
25|$|According to a Coonamble {{resident}} who encountered the Kellys at Glenrowan, Ned {{had heard that}} an individual named Sullivan had given evidence, {{and that he had}} travelled by train from Melbourne to Rutherglen. The Kelly gang then followed him there, but was told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Uralla across the border in New South Wales. By the time they got to Uralla, Sullivan had left for Wagga Wagga. They followed him there but lost sight of him. Kelly thought that he might have travelled to Hay, so they took off in that direction but later gave up their chase. On their return home, they passed through Jerilderie, and the gang then decided to rob the bank.|$|E

25|$|The sources differ as to Westervelt's further {{education}} and early career. He received additional education {{under the tutelage}} of James P. Forrester, then headmaster of the school connected with the Collegiate (Dutch) Church in New York, and was afforded greater educational opportunities under Barron & Brown, in a special course on surveying and navigation. Afterwards he went to sea, serving on ships for more than two years. He left the sea in 1817 and became an apprentice under Christian Bergh, a prosperous shipbuilder on the East River. A differing source reports <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sea directly after his father's death, while another states that he was already apprenticed to Christian Bergh in 1814.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a {{mechanical}} engineering student called Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller's shows, and subsequently sued the show's promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised {{a demonstration of}} several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba. Geller was not present as the summons {{had been sent to}} the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded 27.5 lira (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money back, and he had already found a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.|$|E
25|$|Of course, Cnut's {{journey to}} Rome in 1027 is {{another sign of}} his {{dedication}} to the Christian religion. It may be <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> attend the coronation of Conrad II {{in order to improve}} relations between the two powers, yet he had previously made a vow to seek the favour of St Peter, the keeper of the keys to the heavenly kingdom. While in Rome, Cnut made an agreement with the Pope to reduce the fees paid by the English archbishops to receive their pallium. He also arranged that travellers from his realm not be straightened by unjust tolls and that they should be safeguarded on their way to and from Rome. Some evidence exists for a second journey in 1030.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E

Terry Fator says in his audio {{commentary}} of Terry Fator: Live from Las Vegas (2009) <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> college at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. The beginning of Fator's ventriloquism career dates back to {{when he was in}} fifth grade. While searching for a book for an assignment on Valentine's Day, he came across a book about ventriloquism titled, Ventriloquism for Fun and Profit, by Paul Winchell. Fator checked out the book and started learning about ventriloquism. A few weeks later, Fator purchased a Willie Talk dummy from Sears and soon won a $25 prize for a performance at a church picnic.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July, Queipo de Llano, who was {{the chief}} of the carabineros (the {{frontier}} police) came to Seville in a tour of inspection. In the morning of 18 July, Queipo de Llano accompanied by his ADC and three officers, entered {{in the office of the}} general Villa-Abrille and arrested him. After <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the San Hermenigildo barracks and detained the colonel of the 6th regiment, Manuel Allanegi, who had refused to join the rising. Then the artillery regiment also joined the rising and the rebel troops surrounded and bombed the gobierno civil (civil government), held by loyal assault guards. The civil governor (delegate of the Spanish government) surrendered after Queipo promised to save their lives, but {{the chief of the}} police and the assault guards were executed. Then the Civil Guard in Seville joined to the rebellion. The civil governor, José María Varela Rendueles, was sentenced to death by the rebels, but the sentence was reduced to 30 years' imprisonment.|$|E
