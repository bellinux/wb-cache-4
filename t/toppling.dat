5000|$|In {{the third}} episode [...] "How to Hack a Website", Agent <b>Topple</b> instructs Winters to hack a website. It is {{revealed}} that <b>Topple</b> merely used Winters's hacking expertise {{to remember the}} password to his old GeoCities e-mail. After <b>Topple</b> asks what e-mails are in his inbox, Winters finds an urgent message from 1998 on a secret project involving <b>Topple's</b> past partner Logan and a [...] "test subject".|$|R

In {{the course of}} conversation, it is revealed {{that it is only}} an invitation from <b>Topple's</b> co-worker Doug for his retirement party described as a [...] "big blow-out." [...] Blaming the terror alert from PRISM on boredom, Winters brings up Facebook, a social network. <b>Topple</b> then calls Facebook [...] "the smartest way to keep people dumb since we started fluoridating the water." [...] Winters then admonishes <b>Topple</b> for having her to have to fill out a [...] "88-J" [...] incident form because of revealing classified information so candidly.

50|$|To {{understand}} this concept, {{start with a}} fairly small system. Visualize a set of three dominoes lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino's length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has <b>toppled,</b> the third domino will <b>topple</b> because the second will <b>topple</b> upon being contacted by the first domino.|$|R
25|$|Besides playing games, {{another use}} of dominoes is the domino show, which {{involves}} standing them on end in long lines {{so that when}} the first tile is <b>toppled,</b> it <b>topples</b> the second, which <b>topples</b> the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the domino effect.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the <b>toppling</b> of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in <b>toppling</b> the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

50|$|The most {{damage was}} in the towns of Edgecumbe, Te Teko, Kawerau, Matata and Thornton, where {{chimneys}} <b>toppled</b> and poorly constructed houses were seriously damaged. The hardest hit was Edgecumbe, with damage to approximately 50% of its houses. There was extensive damage to its milk factory, with large storage tanks <b>toppled.</b> Railway tracks in the town were bent and buckled, and an 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive <b>toppled</b> over.|$|R

5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, <b>toppling</b> a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|Although Katia passed well {{north of}} the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted for Guadeloupe to notify {{residents}} of dangerous seas. Strong rip currents along the East Coast of the United States led {{to the deaths of}} two swimmers. After losing its tropical characteristics, Katia prompted the issuance of numerous warnings across Europe. Hurricane-force winds impacted numerous locations, downing trees, <b>toppling</b> power poles, and leaving thousands without electricity. The storm was responsible for two deaths in the United Kingdom: one when a tree fell on a vehicle in County Durham, and another during a multi-car accident on the M54 motorway resulting from adverse weather conditions. The post-tropical cyclone caused approximately £100m ($157million, 2011 USD) in damage in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the <b>toppling</b> of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E
50|$|Euromaidan protesters <b>toppled</b> several {{statues of}} Vladimir Lenin in Ukrainian cities. Some {{estimates}} said {{that more than}} 90 statues were <b>toppled.</b> In December 2015 The Ukrainian Week calculated that 376 Lenin monuments were removed and/or destroyed in February 2014.|$|R
50|$|On Tuesday, March 14th, 2017, a 100-foot tall {{wind turbine}} located in Galilee Rhode Island was <b>toppled</b> over by an intense winter storm. Strong winds snapped the {{turbines}} supporting metal structure in half. Along with the snow, strong winds, and <b>toppled</b> wind turbine, {{many of the}} households in Galilee suffered from a loss of power due to this storm. The turbine {{was reported to have}} <b>toppled</b> around 11:00 am. Shortly after, around noon, the town's loss of power followed.|$|R
40|$|Consider the Abelian sandpile {{measure on}} Z d, d≥ 2, {{obtained}} as the L→∞ {{limit of the}} stationary distribution of the sandpile on [−L,L] d ∩Z d. When adding a grain of sand at the origin, some region, called the avalanche cluster, <b>topples</b> during stabilization. We prove bounds on the behaviour of various avalanche characteristics: {{the probability that a}} given vertex <b>topples,</b> the radius of the <b>toppled</b> region, and the number of vertices <b>toppled.</b> Our results yield rigorous inequalities for the relevant critical exponents. In d= 2, we show that for any 1 ≤k<∞, the last k waves of the avalanche have an infinite volume limit, satisfying a power law upper bound on the tail of the radius distribution...|$|R
5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the <b>toppling</b> of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac Theme to secure the allegiance of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in <b>toppling</b> his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, <b>toppling</b> one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.|$|E

5|$|The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864– 20 February 1865) {{was fought}} between Uruguay's {{governing}} Blanco Party and an alliance {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan Colorado Party, covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at <b>toppling</b> Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.|$|E
5|$|The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian {{liberal and}} {{nationalist}} uprising in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848, and closely {{connected with the}} unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia, it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led {{by a group of}} young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia, the movement succeeded in <b>toppling</b> the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency, and in passing a series of major progressive reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the <b>toppling</b> of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917, the Red Army invaded the {{southern}} Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. In May 1920, Bagramyan, upset with the country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent {{to work in the}} fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the Turkish–Armenian War. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.|$|E
