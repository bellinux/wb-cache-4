2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{rail spike}} (also {{known as a}} cut spike or crampon) is a large nail with an offset head {{that is used to}} secure rails and base plates to {{railroad}} ties (sleepers) in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the rail spike, the first recorded use of which was in 1832. The railroad spike was an invention which resulted from the state of industrialisation in the United States in the early 19th century: English mainline railways of that period used heavy and expensive cast iron chairs to secure T-shaped rails; instead, Stevens added a supporting base to the T rail which could be fixed with a simple spike. In 1982, the spike was still the most common rail fastening in North America. Common sizes are from 9/16 to 10/16 in square and 5+1/2 to 6 in long.A rail spike is roughly chisel-shaped and with a flat edged point; the spike is driven with the edge perpendicular to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening. The main function is to keep the rail in gauge. When attaching tie plates the attachment is made as strong as possible, whereas when attaching a rail to tie or <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> the spike is not normally required to provide a strong vertical force, allowing the rail some freedom of movement.|$|E

40|$|Finite element {{models were}} {{developed}} and analyses performed for the <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> inner tie block assembly, and corner tie block assembly of a 25 port fuel rack assembly designed for installation in Pool 1 of Building 666 at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. These models were specifically developed {{to investigate the}} adequacy of certain welds joining components of the fuel storage rack assembly. The work scope for the task was limited to {{an investigation of the}} stress levels in the subject subassemblies when subjected to seismic loads. Structural acceptance criteria used for the elastic calculations performed were as found in the overall rack design report as issued by the rack`s designer, Holtec International. Structural acceptance criteria used for the plastic calculations performed as part of this effort were as defined in Subsection NF and Appendix F of the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. The results of the analyses will also apply to the 30 port fuel storage rack design that is also scheduled for installation in Pool 1 of ICPP 666. The results obtained from the analyses performed for this task indicate that the welds joining the inner tie block and corner tie block to the surrounding rack structure meet the acceptance criteria. Further, the structural members (plates and blocks) were also found to be within the allowable stress limits established by the acceptance criteria. The separate analysis performed on the inner <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> confirmed the structural adequacy for both the inner <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> corner <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> and tie block bolts.

40|$|While wood {{has long}} been the {{standard}} material for crossties, several factors have in recent years increased interest by the railroad community in possible alternative materials. These factors include increased wear due to higher loads, and environmental concerns associated with preservative chemical treatments. Several manufacturers have entered the market with a variety of plastic composite material designs. Some of these plastic composite ties have to various degrees been subjected to laboratory and field tests including the FAST in Pueblo, CO. Several thousands of plastic composite ties have been installed in track, ranging from mass transit to Class 1 revenue service applications. While these products have some performance attributes that make them attractive alternatives to wood, they also have some properties that are somewhat different than traditional wood materials and are not fully understood. Performance and safety issues arising from these properties include: fracture, low tie-ballast interaction, spike-holding power, <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> cutting, creep (increased gage), stress-relaxation (spike loosening), and effects of environmental exposures.

Many CCFL data {{have been carried out}} with air and water as well as with steam and water, e. g. UPTF, MHYRESA and Hannover separate test facilities. In case of steam/water, the CCFL involves not only the mechanical interactions but also the thermal exchanges, due to steam condensation on subcooled emergency core cooling (ECC) water, which might lead to water breakthrough. The experiments carried out at University of Hannover (i. e. the tests with a 16 x 16 rod bundle) constitute a suitable database to validate RELAP 5 code and to support its application in accident analysis (e. g.

The different options of RELAP 5 ’s CCFL model are tested to assess the code performance, following the set up of the input deck through the optimization of the energy loss coefficients (Reynolds independent and dependent as well). Sensitivities are also performed to address the effect of the time step and of the nodalization on the results.
