These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and represent their political ideologies, including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, the Enterprise is caught in a time loop which results in the destruction of the ship and the loss of all hands after a collision with the USS Bozeman. As events re-occur, they begin <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sense of déjà vu and upon investigating, realize their predicament. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) realizes how to pass a brief message to himself in the next loop, which allows him to save the ship from destruction.|$|E

40|$|In {{a public}} {{university}} in Tunja (Colombia), undergraduate language students mentioned that writing was important and yet, they kept {{at a distance}} from it due to its requirements. The aim of this pedagogical intervention was to find a strategy to encourage students to write and, more importantly, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> identity with their texts. For this pedagogical intervention, students were required to write narratives that allowed them to portray their experiences using the target language and to look for the most accurate words and descriptions. From a pedagogical perspective, writing the narratives provided the teacher with the possibility of knowing his students better and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> affiliation towards them...|$|R
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> little sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with {{the tone of the}} film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} museum's {{holdings}} is Kanoo's own {{collection of}} Qur'anic manuscripts and Islamic art, since he was reportedly {{said to have been}} an avid collector. As his collection grew, he reportedly came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of responsibility toward the rare manuscripts he had acquired. In 1990, he donated his collection to the museum he established to operate a first-of-its-kind institution dedicated to the service of the Qur'an and the preservation of historic manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Francis sees in journeying {{together}} to shrines a thirst for God and a working of the Spirit. They {{enable us to}} witness to our belief and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> part of the Church. Bringing one's children or inviting others is an evangelizing gesture (EG 122-6).|$|E
50|$|Subtle {{expressions}} {{occur when}} a person’s emotional {{response to a}} situation, to another person or to the environment around them is of low intensity. They also occur {{when a person is}} just starting <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> emotion.|$|R

25|$|A new {{addition}} is a portable touch tank which allows visitors <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> shark's scales and the rubbery {{skin of a}} stingray. During warmer months, little penguins can be found outside near {{the entrance of the}} aquarium. The only freshwater display is of the Amazon rainforest that includes fish, invertebrates, turtles, and mammals (including common squirrel monkeys).|$|E
25|$|Boots {{and wraps}} are worn by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E
25|$|Most times {{a foreign}} {{language}} is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible {{to most of the}} target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.|$|E

Volunteers who removed some of the {{graffiti}} believed that different types of paint were used. Lloyd's highway superintendent noted similar vandalism elsewhere in the town, and Town Supervisor Ray Costantino stated that the incident would cause Lloyd residents <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> personal connection to the trail and become outraged.|$|E
500|$|Prior to its release, the Kinks {{performed}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] in some {{of their}} early concerts. It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> connection with the crowd as he performed the song. Ray later said, [...] "Our success came from playing [...] live. When we played 'You Really Got Me' people actually took notice. They realised we had something original." ...|$|E
500|$|As most of {{the main}} cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein {{instructed}} them to attend {{all of the major}} events that take place within the film, including a wedding and a circumcision. Yaron commented, [...] " [...] it was so intense and [...] was crying and she was really in it and I felt like she was my sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> part of it actually." ...|$|E
50|$|To be multifaith is <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> {{affinity}} with aspects {{of more than}} one religion, philosophy or world-view, and perhaps to believe that no one is superior to the others. This term {{should not be confused with}} interfaith, which concerns the communication between different religions.|$|R

60|$|Wade divined {{that was}} a favor {{difficult}} for Belllounds to ask. The old rancher, dominant and forceful and self-sufficient all his days, had begun <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> encroachment of opposition beyond his control. If he but realized it, the favor he asked of Wade was an appeal.|$|R
500|$|The {{production}} team of A52 {{had intended to}} [...] "create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> larger presence {{of good and evil}} over all of time." [...] A52 then pitched their idea to Carnivàle executives in early 2003, who felt that the company's proposal was the most creative for the series' concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300MB in size. The resulting images were photoshopped and digitally rendered. A last step involved stock footage clips being compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E

[...] Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him. [...] Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> hard slap {{as if it was a}} kiss.

500|$|The story follows an {{exploratory}} ship {{sent by the}} League to investigate a newly discovered planet, named World 4470. The team includes Osden, an [...] "empath" [...] {{who is able to}} feel the emotions of those around him; however, he has an abrasive personality that leads to tensions within the team. The ship finds World 4470 to be a world covered in forests, and apparently devoid of animal life. However, the team eventually begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> fear emanating from the planet. The team realizes that the entire vegetation on the planet is part of a singular consciousness, which is reacting in fear at the explorers after spending its whole life in isolation.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bright of Ars Technica praised {{many of the}} {{improvements}} on Windows 8.1, such as its more [...] "complete" [...] touch interface, the [...] "reasonable" [...] tutorial content, the new autocomplete tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> bit disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E
