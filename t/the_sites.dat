5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the central British state began to reacquire control of <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> Caernarfon had {{never left the}} direct control of the Crown, but Harlech was {{transferred}} to the control of the Office of Works in 1914, Beaumaris followed in 1925 and Conwy was finally leased to the Ministry of Works in 1953. The state invested heavily in conservation of <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b> The 1920s saw large-scale conservation programmes at both Beaumaris and Harlech, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework, but otherwise leaving <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> intact and avoiding outright restoration. Major work was undertaken at Conwy in the 1950s and 1960s, including the clearing away of newer buildings encroaching on the 13th-century walls.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> of <b>the</b> Regia {{has been}} {{investigated}} via archaeological excavation for some time, although a comprehensive publication of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is still forthcoming. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> was first cleared between 1872 and 1875. In 1876 F. Dutert discussed <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in his volume on the Forum Romanum, and, subsequently, Nichols identified <b>the</b> <b>site</b> as being <b>the</b> Regia in 1886. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> was explored again by Hülsen in 1889. The Italian archaeologist Giacomo Boni conducted excavations at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 1899. <b>The</b> American archaeologist Frank Brown dug at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in <b>the</b> 1930s {{and again in the}} 1960s.

5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> themselves; in the New World, <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E
5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where {{fossils of}} A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and {{is thought to}} represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> of Mes Aynak {{possesses}} a vast complex of Buddhist monasteries, homes, and market areas. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> contains artifacts {{recovered from the}} Bronze Age, {{and some of the}} artifacts recovered have dated back over three thousand years. <b>The</b> <b>site's</b> orientation on <b>the</b> Silk Road has yielded a mixture of elements from Iran, China and India. The wealth of Mes Aynak’s residents has been well represented in <b>the</b> <b>site's</b> far-reaching size and well guarded perimeter. Afghanistan’s eagerness to unearth the copper below <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is leading to <b>the</b> <b>site's</b> destruction rather than its preservation. Archaeologists have photographed <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and <b>the</b> relics excavated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> was {{originally}} launched in March 2003 by Dan Pouliot, with {{the scope of}} <b>the</b> <b>site</b> explicit also {{to the concerns of}} the [...] "creative professional". <b>The</b> <b>site</b> {{was originally}} intended to advocate OS X by virtue of a fair comparison to Windows XP. Pouliot acknowledged that such a fair comparison was difficult, and he relied on debates within <b>the</b> <b>site's</b> own online forum to refine and expand <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> A PDF version of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was available, and Pouliot reports it was downloaded 250,000 times between the launch of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and <b>the</b> time the PDF was removed in January 2005.|$|R
5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. <b>The</b> <b>sites</b> were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. <b>The</b> <b>sites</b> of what were two settlements and a burial ground {{can be seen on}} Lindholm Høje, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on <b>the</b> <b>sites,</b> and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> {{started as}} <b>the</b> home of Mary Ellis. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> was a Great Eastern Department Store in 1955. In the 1970s {{it became the}} Route 1 Flea Market. One {{exterior}} shot of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{was used in the}} movie Mallrats. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> was converted into a Loews Theater on November 22, 1996 and the Mary Ellis grave is extant at <b>the</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R

During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd with medical supplies and a large fund of money for distribution. Her express instructions were that assistance was to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately. To fulfill her wishes, Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff, under Dr. Thomas Roddick to <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded, including the Métis opposition.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of the concepts of political power, structure and agency in the study of International Relations. It argues that mainstream IR theory has yet to incorporate the main findings of critical theories, such as post-modernism and feminism, into its analytical toolbox. It will offer the author's own theory of world power, which combines a Foucaultian with a structurationist approach to argue for the existence of four-faced power relationships across twelve interdependent sites of material and cognitive power: i) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of time; ii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of space; iii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of knowledge and aesthetics; iv) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of morality and emotion; v) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of identities; vi) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of <b>the</b> body; vii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of welfare; viii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of culture/cultural life; ix) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of civic associations; x) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of <b>the</b> economy; xi) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of <b>the</b> organisation of violence and coercive relations; and xii) <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of regulatory and legal institutions. These power relations operate at multiple levels of agency across world society, from the individual through to world polities, as well as across <b>the</b> twelve <b>sites</b> of power interdependently. The case of HIV/AIDS is then used to illustrate the necessity of broadening mainstream conceptions of power in International Relations...|$|R
