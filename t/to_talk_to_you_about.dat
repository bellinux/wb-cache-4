5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> AIDS, and {{not about}} AIDS in China or Africa, but AIDS {{right here in}} this country, where black {{women between the ages of}} 25 and 44 are 13 times more likely to die of the disease than their counterparts. What should the government's role be in helping to end the growth of this epidemic? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scarcely that," [...] she replied, [...] "only, you see, {{it seemed}} {{waste of time}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with the foils on, and a little dangerous, perhaps, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with them off." ...|$|R
60|$|It's no {{business}} of mine. I {{have no right}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like this.|$|R

2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, {{a senior member of}} Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing {{at a time when the}} United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.

6000|$|... "My man," [...] said Captain Smollett, [...] "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} desire <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> can come, that's all.
