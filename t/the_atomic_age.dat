It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E

One of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>age.</b> In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the Bulletin to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about.
