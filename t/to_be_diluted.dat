5|$|The tidal {{rise and}} fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. This tidal {{movement}} contributes to the deposition of natural mud in bays such as Weston. There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at {{the eastern end of}} the Bristol Channel; however this tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diluted</b> by the Atlantic waters. There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants, and little is known about their effects. Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diluted</b> with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E

40|$|InSU(2) {{gauge theory}} colour {{confinement}} occurs if the vacuum condenses {{into a coherent}} monopole plasma. To verify this picture, the first question <b>to</b> <b>be</b> answered is whether the vacuum supports monopoles at all. Since we expect the monopoles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dilute</b> and massive in the deconfinement, phase, we begin the search there. The method relies on cooling equilibrium lattice gauge field configurations—which are generated at the appropriate temperature—until the underlying semiclassical solutions emerge. We then pass to the confinement region and ask whether the monopoles condense. Finally, we repeat the procedure for gauge groupSU(3). The results confirm our expectations...|$|R

One component, the intruders, <b>is</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dilute</b> with respect <b>to</b> the other, and thermal segregation {{of the two}} species is described for a special exact solution to the Boltzmann equation. This solution has a macroscopic hydrodynamic representation with a constant temperature gradient and <b>is</b> referred <b>to</b> as the Fourier state. The thermal diffusion factor characterizing conditions for segregation is calculated without the usual restriction to Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for comparison with the results for this idealized Fourier state...|$|R
40|$|Assessment {{of heavy}} metal {{bioavailability}} in sediments is complex {{because of the}} number of partial extraction methods available for the assessment and the general lack of certified reference materials.

25|$|During the Greek period, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} changed.

The latter become important when the medium {{can no longer}} <b>be</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>dilute.</b> Unlike the standard formulation of EIT, we consider all fields applied and generated as interacting with both the transitions of the Λ scheme. We solve Maxwell equations for the net generated field using a fast-Fourier-transform technique and obtain predictions for the probe, control and Raman fields. We show how {{the intensity of the}} probe field is depleted at higher atomic number densities due to the build up of multiple Raman fields. Comment: 3. 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

The need for dilution is a disadvantage, as every dilution adds inaccuracy to the measurement.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century, the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis {{described}} Catalan wines as strong, dense, highly alcoholic wines which, although high quality, sometimes needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diluted</b> with water. A {{turning point}} for the Catalan wine industry occurred in the 19th century with {{the outbreak of the}} phylloxera epidemic that ravaged the French vineyards to the north. Along with wines from the Rioja region, Catalan wines became a welcome import for French consumers suffering a severe shortage of domestic produce.|$|E

Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. However, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diluted</b> from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the company's shares before being ejected from the building. Subsequently, Saverin's name {{is removed from the}} masthead as co-founder. Later, a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him.|$|E

60|$|The milk-tree rises with a {{straight}} stem to an enormous height, and the fruit, {{about the size of}} a small apple, is full of rich and juicy pulp, and is very good. The timber, also, is hard, fine-grained, and durable,--particularly adapted for such works as are exposed to the weather. But its most remarkable peculiarity is the rich vegetable milk which flows in abundance from it when the bark is cut. This milk is so like to that of the cow in taste, that it can scarcely be distinguished from it, having only a very slight peculiarity of flavour, which is rather agreeable than otherwise. In tea and coffee it has the same effect as rich cream, and, indeed, is so thick that it requires <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>diluted</b> with water before being used. This milk is also employed as glue. It hardens when exposed to the air, and becomes very tough and slightly elastic, and is said to be quite as good and useful as ordinary glue.|$|E
