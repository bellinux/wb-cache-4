5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though studies have shown that <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as {{they do not have the}} proper scent. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence.
