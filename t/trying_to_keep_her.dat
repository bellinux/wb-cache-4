5|$|Mia Ikumi {{spent a year}} {{designing}} the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before {{the release of the}} first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, Tokyo Black Cat Girl, featured a heroine named Princess Azumi who is given the ability to transform into a cat-girl by an intergalactic police officer named Masha. He then asks her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Baku using her new powers. Azumi agrees, while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> new double life secret from her crush. After the production team decided to focus on five female superhumans, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character and the darker Princess Azumi was changed into the brighter and more colorful Ichigo. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.|$|E

500|$|The {{cause of}} Terri Schiavo's {{collapse}} {{was determined to}} be cardiac arrest. Her medical chart contained a note that [...] "she apparently has been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of iced tea." [...] Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from hypokalemia (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube.|$|E
500|$|On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet {{mounted a}} major {{attack on the}} Ottoman defences; Ocean joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and {{suppress}} the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans {{they were going to}} land troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship [...] and then the battlecruiser [...] began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, and the battleship Bouvet struck a mine and exploded. Later in the day, [...] was disabled by a mine in Erenköy Bay. Once it became apparent that the ship could not be saved, all of her surviving crew was taken off by destroyers except for her commanding officer and some volunteers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> afloat. Ocean was sent in to tow her out, but she ran aground during the attempt, and, after freeing herself, found it impossible to take Irresistible under tow because of the shallow water, Irresistibles increasing list, and heavy enemy fire. Ocean then took off the remaining members of Irresistibles crew and left the abandoned battleship to her fate; Irresistible sank unobserved by Allied forces, at around 19:30.|$|E
