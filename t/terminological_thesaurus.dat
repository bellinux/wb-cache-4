The detailed analysis of a relations scheme between tables and structures of tables with the help of three-layer decomposition predicate method is carried out, which has allowed to define ways of solving direct and reversible three-language electronic dictionaries creation problem...|$|E
40|$|AMTEx is {{a medical}} {{document}} indexing method, specifically designed for the automatic indexing of documents in large medical collections, such as MEDLINE, the premier bibliographic database of the U. S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). AMTEx combines MeSH, the <b>terminological</b> <b>thesaurus</b> resource of NLM, with a wellestablished method for extraction of terminology, the C/NC-value method. The performance evaluation of two AMTEx configurations is measured against the current state-of-the-art, the MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) method in four experiments, using two types of corpora: a subset of MEDLINE (PMC) full document corpus and a subset of MEDLINE (OHSUMED) abstracts, {{for each of the}} indexing and retrieval tasks respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that AMTEx performs better in indexing in 20 - 50 % of the processing time compared to MMTx, while for the retrieval task, AMTEx performs better in the full text (PMC) corpus...|$|E
40|$|Term {{extraction}} {{relates to}} extracting the most characteristic or important terms (words or phrases) in a document. This information {{is commonly used}} for improving the accuracy of document indexing and retrieval in large text collections. It also allows for faster and {{better understanding of the}} contents of a document collection without first browsing through the contents of its documents. This paper presents AMTEX, an automatic term extraction method, specifically designed for the automatic indexing of documents in large medical collections such as MEDLINE, the premier bibliographic database of the U. S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). AMTEX combines MeSH, the <b>terminological</b> <b>thesaurus</b> resource of NLM, with a well-established method for extraction of domain terms, the C/NC-value method. The performance evaluation of various AMTEX configurations in the indexing task is measured against the current state-of-the-art, the MMTx method. The experimental results on a subset of MEDLINE documents demonstrate that AMTEX achieves better precision and recall than MMTx...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEcological {{research}} {{produces a}} tremendous amount of data, but the diversity in scales and topics covered {{and the ways in which}} studies are carried out result in large numbers of small, idiosyncratic data sets using heterogeneous terminologies. Such heterogeneity can be attributed, in part, to a lack of standards for acquiring, organizing and describing data. Here, we propose a <b>terminological</b> resource, a <b>Thesaurus</b> Of Plant characteristics (TOP), whose aim is to harmonize and formalize concepts for plant characteristics widely used in ecology. TOP concentrates on two types of plant characteristics: traits and environmental associations. It builds on previous initiatives for several aspects: (i) characteristics are designed following the entity-quality (EQ) model (a characteristic is modelled as the ‘Quality’ of an ‘Entity’) used in the context of Open Biological Ontologies; (ii) whenever possible, the Entities and Qualities are taken from existing terminology standards, mainly the Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) ontologies; and (iii) whenever a characteristic already has a definition, if appropriate, it is reused and referenced. The development of TOP, which complies with semantic web principles, was carried out through the involvement of experts from both the ecology and the semantics research communities. Regular updates of TOP are planned, based on community feedback and involvement. TOP provides names, definitions, units, synonyms and related terms for about 850 plant characteristics. TOP is available online (www. top-thesaurus. org), and can be browsed using an alphabetical list of characteristics, a hierarchical tree of characteristics, a faceted and a free-text search, and through an Application Programming Interface. Synthesis. Harmonizing definitions of concepts, as proposed by TOP, forms the basis for better integration of data across heterogeneous data sets and terminologies, thereby increasing the potential for data reuse. It also allows enhanced scientific synthesis. TOP therefore has the potential to improve research and communication not only within the field of ecology, but also in related fields with interest in plant functioning and distribution...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{and methodological}} {{problems}} of creation the glossary for {{the preparation of}} encyclopedic dictionary, which {{is related to the}} Republic of Tatarstan archaeology are considered in this article. It is noticed that creation of such generalizing editions determines a new important stage of science and its theoretic and methodological basis development. Encyclopedias and dictionaries are the <b>terminological</b> <b>thesaurus</b> and functioning as a source of norms. They are forming the uniform, unifying and conventional approach to archaeological definitions and their content. They are also able to provide an insight into the basic archaeological concepts in the accessible form, to give the characteristic to archaeological monuments on Republic territory, to acquaint with archaeologists, who has ever worked on territory of Tatarstan, to present the last archaeological discoveries, and to popularize achievements of the Kazan Archaeology school. The complete information about archaeology in Republic is supposed {{to be included in the}} encyclopedic dictionary on archaeology of Tatarstan (the special attention will be focused on the conceptual system of archaeology, monuments and antiquity subjects), about objects and monuments of historic and archaeological heritage, as well as biographic data of all archaeologists who has ever worked in Tatarstan and information about all organizations related to archaeology in region. There are all preconditions to claim that the considerable source study and theoretical base for creation of the encyclopedic dictionary on archaeology of Tatarstan is created. It is gathered the significant experience on complex studying and generalization of considerable volume of a material which is referring to an ancient and medieval history of region and on research and ordering of archaeological monuments. It is suggested that at the first investigation phase will be created a glossary and after that the collective of authors can pass to creation of the high-grade encyclopedic dictionary. ...|$|E
