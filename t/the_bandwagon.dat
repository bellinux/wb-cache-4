5|$|The {{success of}} the music {{produced}} by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981. He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by {{the ease with which}} record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal. Coincidentally, in the same year, <b>the</b> <b>Bandwagon</b> was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant. Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls, it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on <b>the</b> <b>bandwagon</b> of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Kornheiser {{created a}} string of now-famous Bandwagon columns to {{describe}} the Washington Redskins' Super Bowl run that year. He started the idea when the Redskins trounced the Detroit Lions 41-10. He officially unveiled the first Bandwagon column when the team had an undefeated 4-0 record. From then on, <b>the</b> <b>Bandwagon</b> column appeared weekly. When the Redskins advanced to Super Bowl XXVI, Kornheiser and his Post colleagues Jeanne McManus and Norman Chad rode a handcar on a railroad track decorated as <b>the</b> <b>Bandwagon</b> for a 1,200-mile journey to Minneapolis, Minnesota.|$|E

25|$|At a {{time when}} the women's {{suffrage}} movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor Pathé Frères released an adventure film serial titled The Perils of Pauline.

As a result, Kalem Studios jumped on <b>the</b> <b>bandwagon</b> and in November 1914 released their own adventure series called The Hazards of Helen.|$|E
25|$|In writing 1632, Flint's web forum Mutter of Demons at Baen's Bar {{was soon}} {{taken over by}} {{exploratory}} posts as captivated readers commented on the E-ARC released book, creating a ground swell of interest ("Internet buzz") {{in the months before}} its hardcover release. So strong was the response, especially after the release of the printed work, that a new 1632 Tech Manual sub-forum was created for discussions about it in early 2000, for the discussions had also spilled over into Weber's Bu-ships tech forum, and Weber joined <b>the</b> <b>bandwagon</b> by suggesting a sequel was in order. In the event, the two co-wrote 1633 and collaborated further on integrating the short fiction (much of it unsolicited) into the de facto Ring of Fire sequel. It was followed by two other related forums: 1632 Slush and 1632 Comments, within the next two years.|$|E
25|$|Around June 220, Qu Yan (麴演) rebelled {{again in}} Xiping Commandery {{and managed to}} garner support in two {{neighbouring}} commanderies, Zhangye and Jiuquan. His allies, Zhang Jin (張進) and Huang Hua (黃華), rebelled against Du Tong (杜通) and Xin Ji (辛機), the Administrators of Zhangye and Jiuquan respectively, and declared themselves the new Administrators. Zhang Jin even took Du Tong hostage. To make things worse, the non-Han Chinese tribes in Wuwei Commandery {{seized the opportunity to}} start raiding and pillaging counties, while other local elites (both Han Chinese and non-Han Chinese) throughout Yong and Liang provinces wanted to jump on <b>the</b> <b>bandwagon</b> and join the rebels. The rebellions caused a major disruption in trade flows along the Hexi Corridor. Guanqiu Xing (毌丘興), the Administrator of Wuwei Commandery, sent an urgent report to Su Ze in Jincheng Commandery and sought his aid in dealing with the rebels. At the time, Su Ze had with him two military officers, Hao Zhao and Wei Ping (魏平), who were in command of Jincheng Commandery's armed forces. However, they were not allowed to lead the troops into battle without authorisation from the Han central government.|$|E

500|$|While British and {{international}} media covered punk intensively, the new grassroots metal movement remained underground until 1978, largely ignored by popular music magazines such as New Musical Express, The Face and Melody Maker and by radio stations. News about the bands and music circulated by word-of-mouth and fanzines, or through interested DJs, who travelled {{the country from}} club to club. Neal Kay {{was one of those}} DJs; he started to work in 1975 at a [...] called <b>The</b> <b>Bandwagon</b> in Kingsbury, North West London, housed in the back-room of the Prince of Wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system. He transformed his nights at <b>The</b> <b>Bandwagon</b> into The Heavy Metal Soundhouse, a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music and a place to listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands, which circulated among fans through cassette trading.|$|E

[...] Despite the opposition of Illinois' Republican political machine, Dawes and Hanna were able to secure {{all but a few}} of Illinois' delegates for McKinley, giving the former Ohio governor a strong advantage going into the convention.

Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at <b>the</b> <b>Bandwagon,</b> {{and one of the}} songs, [...] "Prowler", eventually went to No.1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine. A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager, and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club. Featuring only three tracks (one song, [...] "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.|$|E

500|$|Despite its notorious reputation, {{there were}} a few cases of honest and hardworking karung guni men who made good, and became millionaires. One was Poon Buck Seng who started his {{business}} with only a capital of S$50 by picking up junk, or paying small amounts for things people were throwing away in the 1980s. He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves' Market. Within seven years, he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby, and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers, refrigerators, videotape recorders and television sets, in addition to old clothes, shoes and records. In 1993, he registered his second-hand goods trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts, as there were not many people doing that back then, and his business thrived. He made a few thousand dollars every month and five years later, Poon had saved enough money to buy a [...] freehold property worth S$730,000 and was offered S$1.4 million for the unit in a collective sale later. His export business lasted only 10 years. By 2002, Poon's business was declining as too many people had jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>bandwagon.</b> He decided to end his export business and went back to his old karung guni trade again that lasts to this very day.|$|E
