40|$|Closed digital annular pulley {{tears are}} a common injury within the rock {{climbing}} community. The most often used injury, partial or complete tears of the A 2 pulley, occurs due to forceful contraction of the tendon with the fingers in a crimp grip position. The most common method of prophylactic and temporary fixation of A 2 pulley tears is circumferential taping, wherein a piece of athletic tape is wrapped circumferentially around the finger {{at the level of}} the A 2 pulley. This method has been shown to limit A 2 tears and minimize pain due to partial tears. Unfortunately, this method does not protect adjacent pulleys (A 1, A 3) at increased risk when taping the A 2. Schoffl et al. has proposed a new taping method known as "H-taping" which enables simultaneous protection of the A 1 -A 3 pulleys. [1] We investigate this taping method through biomechanical testing for prophylactic and temporary treatment of A 2 pulley tears. Fourteen matched fresh-frozen cadaver hands with forearms were used in this study (50 - 98 y/o; mean 73 y/o). The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons were identified and sutured for loading. The A 2 pulley of the index (IF), long (LF), ring (RF), and small (SF) finger were identified. The IF's compared intact vs. partially torn (50 %) A 2 pulleys, untaped. The LF's compared intact vs. torn A 2, taped. The RF's compared intact A 2 pulleys, aped vs. untaped. The SF's compared torn A 2 pulleys, taped vs. untaped. The "H-tape" was normalized to cover 75 % of the proximal phalanx and middle phalanx of each taped finger, respectively. Mechanical testing: A custom <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> <b>fixture</b> was designed to position the hand in a rock climbing crimp grip with the metacarpophalangeal joint flexed 60 degrees, the proximal interphalangeal joint flexed 90 degrees, and the distal interphalangeal joint hyperextended. Tendons were secured in a novel tendon clamp. An MTS Systems Mini Bionix load frame and 15 kN load cell were used for testing. A displacement controlled protocol (30 mm/min) was used. Specimens were loaded until failure. Ultimate tensile load was defined as the peak load prior to A 2 pulley failure. Tekscan pressure sensors measured the amount of force at the fingertip. Imaging: Digital image correlation (DIC) and ImageJ were used on the index finger to calculate the amount of bowstringing prior to A 2 pulley rupture. The intact pulley (IF) allows greater force to be applied to the tendon prior to failure (Intact 186. 86 N;Torn 151. 35 N) and permits a marginally greater force at the fingertip (Intact 56. 92 N; Torn 46. 36 N). Adding tape to the intact and torn pulley (LF) did not bring the torn pulley up to the level of an intact pulley. Adding tape to an intact (RF) or torn (SF) pulley does not allow for a greater applied force to the tendon (p= 0. 85 and 0. 57, respectively) or an increase in force at the fingertip (p= 0. 40 and 0. 49, respectively). There was no significant difference for the bowstringing between the intact and torn pulley for both the digital image correlation and ImageJ methods. H-taping does not allow for increased applied force to the tendon and does not increase the force at the fingertip in specimens with an intact A 2 pulley. H-taping of a torn pulley does not increase the allowable applied force to the tendon or increase the force at the fingertip to the level of an intact A 2 pulley. The results do not support H-taping as a prophylactic or temporary fixation measure against A 2 pulley injury...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{program has}} been conducted, to irradiate some mature commercial and some experimental polymer films with radiation simulating certain Earth orbits, and to obtain data about the response of each test film's reflective and tensile properties. Protocols to conduct optimized tests were considered and developed to a "prototype" level during this program. Fifteen polymer film specimens were arranged on a specially designed <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> The fixture featured controlled exposure areas, and protected {{the ends of the}} samples for later gripping in <b>tensile</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>fixture</b> featured controlled exposure areas, and protected the ends of the samples for later gripping in <b>tensile</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>fixture</b> containing the films was installed in a clean vacuum chamber where protons, electrons and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation could simultaneously irradiate the specimens. Near realtime UV rates were used, whereas proton and electron rates were accelerated appreciably to simulate 5 years in orbit during a two month test. Periodically, the spectral reflectance of each film was measured in situ. After the end of the irradiation, final reflectance measurements were made in situ, and solar absorptance values were derived for each specimen. These samples were then measured in air for thermal emittance and for tensile strength. Most specimens withstood the irradiation intact, but with reduced reflectance (increased solar absorptance). Thermal emittance changed slightly in several materials, as did their tensile strength and elongation at break. Conclusions are drawn about the performance of the films. Simulated testing to an expected 5 year dose of electrons and protons consistent with those expected at L 2 and 0. 98 AU orbits and 100 equivalent solar hours exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to improve {{characterization}} of hyperelastic materials in biaxial tension through improved design and validation of an existing <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and specimen geometry. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the material properties to variations in selected test parameters was conducted to better understand material response. Misalignment and binding in the original <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> resulted in non-equibiaxial loading and inaccurate stress-strain data. Analysis and modification were required to improve accuracy and repeatability. Vector analysis of the link system and the Minimum Constraint Design method were used to achieve this aim. Based on a proposed set of criteria, a FE analysis was conducted on several biaxial specimen geometries to determine the best shape and scale for obtaining stress and strain data. A stress decay factor (SDF) is proposed to predict internal stresses from measurable data. A test method has been designed around the use of the SDF and was ultimately applied to a cruciform specimen geometry. In addition to the ideal equibiaxial case, numerical simulations have been perturbed in two ways. The first variation involved a specimen gripped clamps offset by up to half the width of the clamp. The second variation involved non-equibiaxial load ratios ranging from 0. 85 to 1. 15. The goal was to quantify the change in stress-strain response to slight deviations from ideal loading conditions. Binding has been eliminated from the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and a 1 : 1 load ratio has been achieved. The new specimen experiences less stress decay while achieving greater experimental strain. A high sensitivity to non-equibiaxial load ratios and low sensitivity to clamp offset are seen in the test parameter analysis. Finally, results from the SDF correction material characterization method is compared with results from an inflated boiling flask geometry...|$|R

Using a green standard shell (Group 1), a partially fired standard shell (Group 2), and a green shell with a different third coat (Group 3), we verified that the fixture can measure differences in strength between sample groups. We attached steel buttons to leveled samples with 0. 05 mL of Hysol-Loctite 9340 epoxy, let it cure for 48 hours, and tested them at 0. 05 in. /min. Most shells failed below the face coat, instead of spalling. Groups 1 and 2 failed in a backup layer, or at the larger stucco beneath it (0. 035 - 0. 044 ″ deep). Group 3 failed in the face coat (0. 010 ″), flat in a backup layer (0. 033 ″), or in rounded craters through several layers (0. 064 ″). We measured fracture areas in Photoshop to calculate failure stresses, which averaged 116. 21 psi for Group 1, 179. 42 psi for Group 2, and 141. 99 psi for Group 3, with respective standard deviations of 21. 78 psi, 30. 84 psi, and 31. 21 psi. Two-sample t-tests showed statistically valid distinctions between each group’s results, indicating that this fixture could be used to further investigate designing a stronger shell to mitigate face coat spalling...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a modified Arcan fixture (MAF) is described. The purpose of the fixture is to characterise polymer foam materials {{with respect to their}} tensile, compressive, shear and bidirectional mechanical properties. The MAF enables the application of pure compression or high compression to shear bidirectional loading conditions that is not possible with conventional Arcan fixtures. The tensile and shear behaviour to failure of a cross-linked Divinycell H 100 PVC foam core material are studied using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). A detailed investigation of the parasitic effects of the fixture and misalignment of the fixture and loading machine are discussed. Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) is used to directly examine and validate the uniformity and symmetry of the stress fields obtained for both tensile and shear specimens. To account for the inhomogeneity of the strain field across the specimen cross sections, a “correction factor” for the measured “gauge section” surface strains has been determined using nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA). The outcome is a set of validated mechanical properties that are in excellent agreement with material property measurements conducted using conventional <b>test</b> <b>tensile</b> and shear <b>test</b> <b>fixtures...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} tensile adhesion button {{has been}} designed and tested that results in higher measured tensile adhesion strength while providing increased capability for testing high strength epoxy adhesive systems. The best attributes of two well-established tensile button designs were combined and refined into an optimized tensile button. The most significant design change to the tensile button was to improve alignment of the bonded tensile button specimens during <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> by changing the interface between the tensile button and the <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> machine. The established or old button design uses a <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> that pulls from a grooved annulus or anvil head while the new button design pulls from a threaded hole in the centerline of the button. Finite element (FE) analysis showed that asymmetric loading of the established anvil head tensile button significantly increases the stress concentration in the adhesive, causing failure at lower <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> loads. The new tensile button was designed to eliminate asymmetric loading and eliminate misalignment sensitivity. Enhanced alignment resulted in improved tensile adhesion strength measurement up to 13. 8 MPa (2000 psi) over the established button design. Another design change increased the capability of the button by increasing the threaded hole diameter allowing it to test high strength epoxy systems up to 85 MPa(less than 12, 000 psi). The improved tensile button {{can be used in}} button- to-button or button-to-panel configurations...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of mode-I {{fracture}} toughness of ductile polymeric thin films is nontrivial. In {{order to gain}} understanding about the fracture mechanics and the processing-structure-property relationships of metallocene linear low-density polyethylene (m-LLDPE) thin film, a custom-built double-edge notched <b>tensile</b> (DENT) <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> was developed to perform the mode-I fracture test on m-LLDPE thin films, and the essential work of fracture (EWF) analysis, which employs an unique energy partitioning concept, was used to characterize the {{fracture toughness}} of the thin films. Effects of specimen geometry, strain rate, film orientation, processing parameters, and resin densities on the specific essential work of fracture, we, and the specific non-essential work of fracture, wp, were investigated. The usefulness of the methodology incorporating the EWF analysis and the custom-built film fixture for characterizing LLDPE fracture toughness is evaluated and discussed, and {{the correlations between the}} EWF parameters and the films? Elmendorf tear properties were also made. The visual, full-field stress distributions of the EWF film specimens were measured in-situ during mode-I facture testing by the photoelastic method, and the deformation in the process zone of post-mortem specimen was also characterized. A new experimental approach has been developed to directly quantify and partition the total mode-I fracture energy of m-LLDPE blown films. Three distinctive deformation zones have been identified from the photoelastic observation of the m-LLDPE blown films during the mode-I facture testing. These three zones include the essential work zone due to necking and crack propagation, the non-essential plastic deformation zone, and a newly proposed recoverable viscoelastic deformation zone. The tensile true stress-strain curves of m-LLDPE blown films and the full-field strain mapping of the mode-I DENT specimen were generated to allow for quantitative energy partitioning at each deformation zone in-situ as defined by the EWF approach. The current approach allows to perform directly quantification and partitioning of the total mode-I fracture energy for the exact physical interpretation of the EWF parameters and their correlation to material characteristics...|$|R

Universal commercially-manufactured coaxial <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> modified to enable characterization of various microwave solid-state devices in frequency range of 26. 5 to 40 GHz. Probe/waveguide fixture is compact, simple, and designed for non destructive testing of large number of MMIC's. Nondestructive-testing fixture includes cosine-tapered ridge, to match impedance wavequide to microstrip. Advanced technique is microwave-wafer probing. Second advanced technique is electro-optical sampling...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Rapid prototyping journal [© Emerald] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] this work the changes to stereolithography (SL) resin mechanical properties during the injection moulding process were evaluated. A multi-impression SL mould was built and used to inject a series of small flat mouldings. The fixed half SL tool insert included recesses to accommodate <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> specimens. <b>Tensile</b> <b>test</b> specimens made from SL resin were positioned in these recesses and plastic parts were injected. After injecting a predetermined number of mouldings, <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using the <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> specimens. The results from the <b>tensile</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the thermal cycling encountered during the injection moulding process did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the resin. Observations indicated that reducing the temperatures encountered in the tool may lead to longer tool life...|$|R
