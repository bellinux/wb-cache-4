40|$|BIST is an {{attractive}} approach to detect delay faults due to its inherent support for at-speed test. Deterministic logic BIST (DLBIST) is a technique which was successfully applied to stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>testing.</b> As delay <b>faults</b> have lower random pattern testability than stuck-at faults, the need for DLBIST schemes is increased. Nevertheless, an extension to delay <b>fault</b> <b>testing</b> is not trivial, since this necessitates the application of pattern pairs.

The same fault may be detected, missed or provably undetectable in different circuit instances. We introduce the first complete flow to accurately evaluate and systematically maximize the test quality under variability. As the number of possible circuit instances is infinite, we employ statistical analysis to obtain a test set that achieves a fault-efficiency target with an user-defined confidence level. The algorithm combines a classical path-oriented test-generation procedure with a novel waveform-accurate engine that can formally prove that a small-delay fault is not detectable and does not count towards fault efficiency.
