Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study was performed in which participants performed a complex series of mental calculations that spanned about 2 min. An Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational (ACT-R) model [Anderson, J. R. How can the human mind occur in the physical universe? New York: Oxford University Press, 2007] was developed that successfully fit the distribution of latencies. This model generated predictions for the fMRI signal in six brain regions that have been associated with modules in the ACT-R theory. The model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions were confirmed for a fusiform region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>the</b> visual module, for a prefrontal region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>the</b> retrieval module, and for an anterior cingulate region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>the</b> goal module. In addition, the only significant deviations to <b>the</b> motor region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>the</b> manual module were anticipatory hand movements. In contrast, the predictions were relatively poor for a parietal region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> an imaginal module and for a caudate region <b>that</b> <b>reflects</b> <b>the</b> procedural module. Possible explanations of these poor fits are discussed. In addition, exploratory analyses were performed to find regions that might correspond to the predictions of the modules...|$|R
5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> role of the PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity, and this led them to choose strong horizontal elements for the design. In the building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His {{inspiration}} for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised {{design for the}} ship <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology. Given project number A-125, his design added an extra twin main-gun turret, using space and weight made available by {{the reduction of the}} number of boilers from 21 to 12, while the power remained the same. He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability to fire during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of fire. To increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards to improve its resistance to horizontal fire, and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga also planned to add anti-torpedo bulges to improve underwater protection. He estimated that his ship would displace as much as Nagato, although it would cost about a million yen more. Hiraga's changes would have considerably delayed Mutsus completion and were rejected by the Navy Ministry.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} period, Nationalism {{manifested}} {{in the quest for}} a new style of architecture — one <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> cultural identity of the region. Some architects began to temper the Modernist ethos by including indigenous architectural elements, thereby creating a distinctively Indonesian style of modern architecture. Maclaine Pont and Thomas Karsten were the leading exponents here.|$|E

25|$|Realism {{began to}} {{influence}} American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola.

The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron's lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E

25|$|Sonar operators, {{using the}} newly {{developed}} sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by {{what appeared to}} be a false sea floor 300–500 metres deep at day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon. This phenomenon has come to be known as the deep scattering layer.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Liebling and Geof O’Keefe {{decided to}} leave their {{previous}} bands (Shades of Darkness and Space Meat, respectively) {{to form a new}} band that reflected their interest in emerging metal acts such as UFO, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Sir Lord Baltimore. At Liebling’s suggestion, the group was named Pentagram, a name <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> gloomy subject matter of their material. Although the band would change its name several times during 1971 and 1972 (Virgin Death, Macabre, and Wicked Angel were all considered during this period), they would eventually (and permanently) return to Pentagram. Contrary to popular belief, they were never called Stonebunny; this was the name given to Space Meat when Bobby Liebling joined them briefly.|$|E

The researchers were looking for opinions and critical input from the parapsychology community and finally released a revised abstract <b>that</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>the</b> received criticism in its conservative and skeptical language. After the announcements in the press, Randi wrote to the lab again and stated that it was entirely possible {{the two were}} magicians, using common sleight of hand to fool the researchers.|$|E
