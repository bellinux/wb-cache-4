For pyrylium salts with alkyl substituents, such as 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium salts, the best method uses the Balaban-Nenitzescu-Praill synthesis from <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> and acetic anhydride in the presence of tetrafluoroboric, perchloric, or trifluoromethanesulfonic acids. 2,4,6-Triphenylpyrylium salts are converted by bases into stable a 1,5-enedione (pseudobase), but 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium salts on treatment with hot alkali hydroxides afford an unstable pseudobase that undergoes an intramolecular condensation yielding 3,5-dimethylphenol. In warm deuterium oxide, 2,4,6-trimethylpyrylium salts undergo isotopic exchange of 4-methyl hydrogens faster than for the 2- and 6-methyl groups, allowing the synthesis of regioselectively deuterated compounds.|$|E

40|$|Butanol (C 4 H 10 OH) {{has been}} used both to dissect the {{molecular}} targets of alcohols/general anesthetics and to implicate phospholipase D (PLD) signaling {{in a variety of}} cellular functions including neurotransmitter and hormone exocytosis. Like other primary alcohols, 1 -butanol is a substrate for PLD and thereby disrupts formation of the intracellular signaling lipid phosphatidic acid. Because secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanols</b> do not undergo this transphosphatidylation, they have been used as controls for 1 -butanol to implicate PLD signaling. Recently, selective pharmacological inhibitors of PLD have been developed and, in some cases, fail to block cellular functions previously ascribed to PLD using primary alcohols. For example, exocytosis of insulin and degranulation of mast cells are blocked by primary alcohols, but not by the PLD inhibitor FIPI. In this study we show that 1 -butanol reduces catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells to a much greater extent than tert-butanol, and that the PLD inhibitor VU 0155056 has no effect. Using fluorescent imaging we show the effect of these drugs on depolarization-evoked calcium entry parallel those on secretion. Patch-clamp electrophysiology confirmed the peak amplitude of voltage-gated calcium channel currents (I(Ca)) is inhibited by 1 -butanol, with little or no block by secondary or tert-butanol. Detailed comparison shows {{for the first time that}} the different butanol isomers exert distinct, and sometimes opposing, effects on the voltage-dependence and gating kinetics of I(Ca).

Thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport properties of the solution are influenced by this preferential solvation. We concentrate here on the transport of one solventI comp 6 nint WTith ripect to {{the other in the}} field of the ion and show how diffusion and transport measurements can be combined to obtain the transport number of water, say, with respect to the non-aqueous solvent component, It can be shown that n = N LLLJw (l/q) + (l/q where N is the total dynamic solvation number, 1 is the ratio of water to non-aqueous component in the transported solvent and q the corresponding ratio in the bulk. Values of n for alkali-metal and halide ions in solutions of high water content containing raffinose, dioxan, acetone, methanol, allyl alcohol, <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol,</b> dimethysulphoxide and glycine are presented. The values in the 0. 75 % (W/W) raffinose + water system probably approach N in pure water closely; they are Li (16) Na (10) K (6) Cl (4) and H (1). In the remaining systems these figures are reduced by competition of the organic molecule for solvation of the ion; is seen to be influenced by the ion-molecule (acid-base) interaction, steric and kinetic effects.

40|$|The SE 2 {{reaction}} (1) between tetra-alkyltins and mercury(II) salts {{has been}} studied kinetically (R = Me, Et, Prn, Pri, Bun, Bui, Peneo; X = OAc in solvents methanol and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> at 30 °C and R = Me, Et; X = Cl, I, OAc in solvents methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> at 25 °c). R 4 Sn + HgX 2 → R 3 SnX + RHgX (l) The following order of reaction rates was observed for (1), X = OAc, in solvent methanol: R = Me > Et > Prn > Bun > Bui > Peneo > Pri (2) Although this sequence is probably steric in origin, {{it is not the}} same sequence as is observed in SN 2 reactions, and in SE 2 reactions which proceed with inversion of configuration at the substituted carbon atom (SE 2 (open) Inv reactions). It is suggested that reaction (1) in methanol proceeds with retention of configuration at the substituted carbon atom, by mechanism SE 2 (open) Ret. It is further suggested that the stereochemical course of SE 2 (open) reactions of substrates RMXn may be deduced from a consideration of the constitutional effects of alkyl groups (R) on the rate of reaction; if these effects parallel steric effects in SN 2 reactions, then mechanism SE 2 (open) Inv is indicated, but if the constitutional effects parallel those found for reaction (1) in methanol (sequence (2)) then mechanism SE 2 (open) Ret is indicated. In this way, stereochemical assignments for a number of other SE 2 (open) reactions have been deduced. Calculations have shown qualitatively and semi-quantitatively that the reactivity sequence (2) does indeed arise from steric effects, mainly in the transition state, in reaction (1). Similar calculations were also carried out on the SN 2 reaction between bromide ion and alkyl bromides, and it was demonstrated that the different steric effects in inversion and retention reactions are a result of the different geometrical shapes of the transition states. Standard free energies of the reactants in (1) (R = Me, Et; X = Cl, I, OAc) were determined for transfer between the five alcoholic solvents, and combination of these initial state solvent effects with the kinetic data enabled transition state solvent effects to be calculated for the reactions. It was concluded that the transition states in these SE 2 (open) Ret reactions behave as polarisable species, with quite a high degree of charge separation. The SN 2 reaction (3) was also studied kinetically, in solvents water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol,</b> ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate and acetonitrile, at 25 °C.

Solutions of THC and inulin in a mixture of <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> (TBA) and water were spray freeze dried. Drug loads varied from 4 to 30 wt. %. Various powder characteristics of the materials were determined. Stability of THC was determined and compared with freeze dried material. The powders, dispersed with an inhaler based on air classifier technology, were subjected to laser diffraction analysis and cascade impactor analysis. Highly porous particles having large specific surface areas (about go m(2) /g) were produced. At high drug loads, THC was more effectively stabilised by spray freeze drying than by freeze drying. Higher cooling rates during spray freeze drying result in improved incorporation. Fine particle fractions of up to 50 % were generated indicating suitability for inhalation. It was concluded that spray freeze drying from a water-TBA mixture is a suitable process to include lipophilic drugs (THC) in inulin glass matrices. High cooling rates during the freezing process result in effective stabilisation of THC. The powders can be dispersed into aerosols with a particle size appropriate for inhalation.

This study investigated the oxidation of arsenic(III) (As(III)) and diuron using ferrous activated persulfate-based ISCO. The results indicated that Fe(II) /persulfate oxidation could be an effective method to oxidize As(III) and diuron. Effects of pH, S 2 O 82 - and Fe(II) amounts on the destruction of As(III) and diuron were examined in batch experiments. Acidic conditions favored the removal of As(III) and diuron. Four chelating agents, citric acid (CA), Na 2 S 2 O 3, diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA-Na- 2) were used in attempt to maintain the quantity of ferrous ion in solution.

In this work we look both at small clusters, size 2 – 24 molecules, as well as bulk mixtures, 64 or more molecules. For small clusters (2 – 24 molecules), the molecular structure was studied using the EFP method and MP 2. Extensive Monte Carlo/simulated annealing (MC/SA) global optimizations were used to locate low energy structures for all water, alcohol, and water-alcohol mixtures. The alcohols studied include the small, straight-chain, primary alcohols: methanol, ethanol, propanol, and 1 -butanol as well as the secondary alcohol 2 -butanol, and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol.</b> It is shown that a number of low energy mixed clusters retain the structural characteristics of the pure clusters.

The S-TiO 2 and SG-TiO 2 were characterized by PXRD, UV-vis DRS, FTIR, SEM, XPS, BET and PL techniques. It was observed that S 6 + ion was incorporated into the TiO 2 crystal lattice at Ti 4 + lattice site and the sulfur on the surface gets modified to SO 42 - due to the heat treatment under atmospheric conditions. The high photocatalytic activity of S-TiO 2 compared to SG-TiO 2 is attributed to the surface modification of sulfur as sulfate which {{plays a crucial role}} in trapping electrons. S-TiO 2 shows significant increase in the surface area, reduced crystallite size, increased surface acidity, visible light absorption and prolonged lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Hole scavengers like potassium iodide and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> suggested the surface degradation mechanism rather than the bulk degradation pathway. Addition of oxidizing agents to the degradation reaction did not show any enhancement in the degradation rates since the presence of SO 42 - on the TiO 2 surface itself acts as the efficient electron trapping centers. Both trapping and detrapping of the electron takes place more efficiently at SO 42 - centers. The enhanced activity of S-TiO 2 is attributed to the synergistic effect between S 6 + dopant with surface modified SO 42. Â© 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to integrate Brillouin spectroscopy into current soft condensed matter research projects at Edinburgh, namely (i) hydration in methanol-water mixtures and (ii) the behaviour of hard-sphere colloidal dispersions. A Brillouin spectrometer based on a Fabry-Perot interferometer was developed and tested, resulting in a high-resolution instrument operating at variable scattering vector (exchanged momentum), temperature and pressure. The technical aspects of this work were carried out in collaboration with a colleague. Data analysis routines were designed and implemented, enabling calibrated Brillouin spectra to be produced automatically from raw experimental data. Excellent agreement with results on several materials studied in the literature confirmed the accuracy and sensitivity of the spectrometer. The molecular details of hydration in methanol-water mixtures are of great interest due to the prototypical amphiphilic nature of the methanol molecule. The effect of deep cooling on the Brillouin spectrum across a wide range of methanol concentrations was studied in detail, resulting in the first observation of an anomalous increase in sound velocity and maximum in sound absorption at intermediate compositions. A similar effect was then found at higher temperature in aqueous <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol,</b> and was identified in a brief survey of several other aqueous solutions. High pressure Brillouin spectra indicate that this anomalous behaviour may also be present in pure water. It is suggested that these novel effects {{may be due to the}} presence of a relatively unperturbed water structure in the aqueous solutions studied, even at quite high solute concentration.

40|$|Prenatal alcohol {{exposure}} induces diverse developmental anomalies {{that include}} skeletal defects of the limbs and face. However the mechanisms underlying its teratogenic actions remain unclear. The objective {{of my research}} was {{to test the hypothesis}} that ethanol exposure could selectively influence cartilage differentiation in embryonic chondroprogenitor cells. My results demonstrate that 1. 0 - 2. 0 % ethanol treatment significantly elevates both cartilage matrix formation and the expression of cartilage-specific structural genes (type II collagen and aggrecan) in high-density micromass cultures of prechondrogenic mesenchyme isolated from limb buds and facial primordia of stage 23 - 25 chick embryos. Ethanol treatment stimulated cartilage differentiation even in low-density cultures of limb mesenchyme, and in maxillary and hyoid mesenchyme cultures, which undergo little or no chondrogenesis spontaneously. Ethanol's influence on cartilage differentiation appears to be exerted by the alcohol itself rather than a downstream metabolite since <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol,</b> which is not metabolized to an aldehyde, was as effective as ethanol in promoting ' in vitro' chondrogenesis. The ability of alcohol to stimulate cartilage differentiation may be restricted to 'prechondrogenic' mesenchyme, since ethanol treatment failed to enhance chondrogenesis in cultures of phenotypically differentiated chondrocytes isolated from the 16 - 18 day chick embryo sternum. This suggested that ethanol might act at an early point in the chondrocyte differentiation pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, I found that ethanol exposure rapidly elevated expression of transcripts for three chondrogenic regulatory genes, ' Sox- 9, Ets- 2 ', and BMPR-IB, that are expressed during the prechondrogenic cell aggregation events that precede overt cartilage tissue formation. Although it was recently suggested that alcohol-related birth defects might arise from inhibition of 'Msx- 2 ' gene expression, levels of 'Msx- 2 ' mRNA were unaffected by ethanol treatment in the limb mesenchyme cultures. My findings indicate that ethanol exposure has the capacity to directly influence embryonic cartilage differentiation and may provide insight into the molecular basis of alcohol's teratogenic effects on skeletal development ' in vivo'.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of tertiary butyl nitrite and isopropyl nitrite in {{aqueous acid solution}} have been studied. In the case of Isopropyl nitrite the rates of reaction with hydrazoic acid, sulphamic acid, thioglycolic acid and N-methylaniline are markedly reduced {{by the addition of}} propan- 2 -ol. This has been explained in terms of a rapid hydrolysis of the alkyl nitrite to yield an equilibrium concentration of nitrous acid which then effects nitrosation. Analysis of the results gives values for the equilibrium constant for isopropyl nitrite hydrolysis and for the rate constants for nitrous acid nitrosation of the substrate, which are in good agreement with the literature values obtained by direct measurement. For tertiary butyl nitrite the extent of hydrolysis is so large and rapid that the kinetics are identical to those obtained using nitrous acid. The {{reactions of}} isopropyl nitrite in isopropanol and tertiary butyl nitrite in <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> with thiourea and thioglycolic acid have been studied. In both cases the reactions are acid catalysed and the results are consistent with a direct reaction between the protonated alkyl nitrite and the substrate. The reactions with thioglycolic acid were subject to catalysis by chloride and bromide salts and thiourea. The results for chloride and bromide salt are best explained in terms of formation of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid which can then act as a general acid catalyst. For thiourea the catalysis is due to the formation of an equilibrium concentration of s-nitrosothiourea. In acetonitrile the reactions of tertiary butyl nitrite, isopropyl nitrite, isoamyl nitrite and nitrous acid with alcohols and thioglycolic acid were found to be kinetically zero order with respect to the substrate concentration. The results have been interpreted in terms of rate limiting formation of the nitrosonium ion. With less reactive substrates, aniline, N-methylaniline, p-toluidine, acetylacetone, 1, 1, 1,trifluoroacetylacetone and 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, hexafluoroacetylacetone, the reactions are kinetically first order with respect to the substrate concentration and have been interpreted in terms of rate limiting reaction of the nitrosonium ion with the free (at low acidity) or protonated (at high acidity) form of the amine.

40|$|The {{development}} of new functional applications of amorphous alloy is an active and challenging topic. In this work, amorphous Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 alloy, a photo-enhanced Fenton-like catalyst, exhibits excellent functional ability in degrading an azo dye. This study reports the dramatic performance gains achieved for photo-enhanced Fenton-like degradation of cibacron brilliant red 3 B-A (BR 3 B-A) dye aqueous solutions, the reusability of amorphous Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 alloy ribbon catalysts, and the reaction kinetics (k) of the process. The individual and synthetical effects of the various reaction parameters are investigated by employing an orthogonal matrix (L 16 (45)) experimental methodology. The investigation evaluates {{the impact of these}} parameters on the degradation process, in order to demonstrate that UV-vis light could continuously induce hydroxyl radicals (OH) to be generated in the dye aqueous solution and significantly enhance the rate of dye degradation and mineralization. The experimental results show that nearly 100 % color removal is achieved within 5 min under conditions of 2. 0 g/L Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbons, 0. 5 M H 2 O 2 and pH 2. UV-vis light intensity ranging from 0 to 7. 7 μW/cm 2 enhances a dramatic improvement in color removal from 78 % at 200 min to 98 % at 60 min and an improvement in the reaction kinetics (k) from 0. 0413 at 0 μW/cm 2 of light irradiation to 0. 2901 at 7. 7 μW/cm 2 of light irradiation under conditions of 2. 0 g/L Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbons, 0. 5 M H 2 O 2 and natural pH 6. 45. The production of OH is investigated by adding <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol,</b> resulting in a sharp decrease of dye color removal. Structural characterizations of as-received amorphous Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbons and of recycled Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbons are also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometers (UV-vis DRS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS); the results reveal a slight decay of the reused Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ribbons, along with a gradual precipitation of crystallized α-Fe, iron oxide and SiO 2 on the ribbon surface over the few cycles of usage. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|In this work, {{the optical}} {{properties}} of ZnO doped with arsenic and nitrogen were studied. The ZnO samples were grown by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). The solubility of nitrogen in the ZnO films, {{as well as}} its activation upon annealing, was also investigated. Hydrogen is known as a major source for passivation of the acceptors in ZnO:N. Therefore, it is crucial to dissociate the complex(es) formed by nitrogen and hydrogen and diffuse out the hydrogen in order to prevent the reformation of such complexes. High temperatures (≥ 600 C) are required for these purposes. In order to effectively remove the hydrogen impurities from the sample, {{it is important to know}} the optical fingerprints of hydrogen and its thermal stability. Therefore, the effects of annealing and hydrogen plasma treatment on bulk ZnO (hydrothermally grown) were first studied. The use of bulk material for this purpose was motivated by the well-resolved photoluminescence (PL) lines observed for bulk ZnO, which allow the identification of the different lines related to hydrogen after plasma treatment. Annealing at 850 C was effective for the removal of most of the hydrogen related transitions in the near-band-edge emission. Also, additional transitions at ~ 3. 364 eV and ~ 3. 361 eV were observed after hydrogen plasma treatment, which were ascribed to hydrogen-Zn vacancy complexes. In this work, a comparative study of the annealing ambient and temperature on ZnO films grown on GaAs substrate, using diethyl zinc (DEZn) and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> (TBOH), showed that arsenic diffuses in the ZnO films and gives a shallow level in the band gap, which is involved in an acceptor-bound exciton line at 3. 35 eV. This shallow level is visible when annealing is performed in oxygen, but not when annealing is performed in nitrogen, and indeed only for annealing temperatures around 550 C. However, annealing in either ambient also causes zinc to diffuse from the ZnO films into the GaAs substrate, rendering the electrical properties deduced from Hall measurements ambiguous. For ZnO:N, NO was used as both oxygen and nitrogen sources. Monitoring the concentration of nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen in the ZnO films, the formation of different complexes from these impurities were deduced. Furthermore, an investigation of the effect of annealing on the concentrations of impurities showed that their out- diffusion was strongly dependent on the crystalline quality of the ZnO films. For porous ZnO films, obtained at low growth temperatures (≤ 310 C), the out-diffusion of impurities was efficient, whereas for films grown at higher temperatures, which have improved crystalline quality, the out-diffusion was practically nonexistent. The out-diffusion of unwanted impurities may activate the nitrogen dopant in the ZnO films, as was confirmed by the PL measurements on the different samples grown at different temperatures. PL transitions at ~ 3. 24 eV and ~ 3. 17 eV were related to substitutional NO. These transitions were more dominant in the spectra of samples grown at low temperatures. An additional transition at ~ 3. 1 eV was assigned to a donor-acceptor pair transition involving VZn, instead of NO, as previously reporte...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} behind this thesis was based around {{the observation that}} AII and ET- 1 were seen to be mitogenic in vascular smooth muscle cells derived from SPIR but not in those derived from WKY rats. This was then used as a model to investigate the AII and ET- 1 stimulated mitogenic pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells. AII and ET- 1 both stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in SHR derived cells in a dose dependent manner. This data produced a log EC 50 of - 8. 23 0. 1 M for AII and - 9. 24 0. 06 M for ET- 1. However, no stimulations were observed in AII and ET- 1 stimulated WKY derived cells. This increase in [3 H]-thymidine incorporation correlated {{with an increase in}} cell counts and therefore, indicated a mitogenic response. In addition, time course studies indicated that no stimulations had been missed either side of 24 hours in WKY derived cells. All stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in SHR cells was challenged with an increasing concentration of n- butanol producing a 40 % inhibition, which was maximal at a 30 mM concentration. However, the ET-l stimulation of [3 H]-thymidine incorporation was not affected by n-butanol even at the highest concentrations used. <b>Tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> did not act as a nucleophile in the transphosphatidylation assay and was therefore, deemed a suitable negative control. It did not have any significant effect on AII stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in SHR cells which would suggest that n-butanol was not mediating non specific effects. AII and ET- 1 stimulated PLC activity in SHR and WKY cells with an enhanced PLC activity observed in SHR cells with both agonists. This was seen to be dose dependent and therefore, a receptor activated event with an EC 50 of - 7. 31 0. 06 M for AII. AII also stimulated PLD activity in SHR and WKY cells in a dose dependent manner, with an elevated PLD activity present in SHR cells. However, ET- 1 only stimulated PLD activity in WKY cells with no significant stimulation in SHR cells. The PKC inhibitor Ro- 318220 was shown to completely block AII stimulated PLD activity in SHR and WKY cells. This was also the case in ET- 1 stimulated PLD activity in WKY cells. In addition, TPA stimulated PLD activity in SHR and WKY cells on its own. This data indicates that PLD activity is at least partially regulated by PKC activation and therefore, downstream of PLC activation. AII and ET- 1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in both SHR and WKY cells. This stimulation was, however, significantly elevated in SHR compared to WKY cells. In addition, the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was attenuated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and methyl 2, 5 dihydroxycinnamate. However, the two inhibitors did appear to exhibit differential specificity for certain phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Tyrosine kinase inhibition with genistein, methyl 2, 5 dihydroxycinnamate and tyrphostin also produced inhibition of AII stimulated PLD activity in SHR cells. This suggested a tyrosine kinase regulation of PLD activation as well as PKC. Genistein (10 - 100 ?M) was also seen to prevent AII stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in SHR cells which implicated both tyrosine kinases and PLD activity in AII stimulated mitogenesis. Tyrosine kinase inhibition had no effect on AII stimulated PLC activation providing evidence that tyrosine kinase regulation of PLD activity occurs more directly at the level of PLD activation. In summary the data presented reveals a differential mitogenic response of AII and ET- 1 in SHR compared to WKY cells. This {{may be due to the}} enhanced activation of PLC and subsequent PLD activation. However, the ET- 1 stimulated PLD activation in SHR cells may not be as critical as for AII. In addition, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation may also be a requirement for a mitogenic response for both AII and ET- 1...|$|E
40|$|MastersThe {{sensitivity}} of Prednisolone to gamma radiation in aqueous and organic solutions has been investigated. The degradation kinetics study showed an initial zero-order followed by complex reactions illustrated graphically as an overall first order kinetic. The {{study revealed that}} the drug is significantly more sensitive to gamma radiation in aqueous solutions than organic solvents, which {{could be attributed to}} the highly reactive radiolytic products of water, namely; hydroxyl radicals (. OH), hydrogen atoms (. H) and hydrated electrons (. aq.) compared to that produced by the organic solvents. The structure activity relationship of the organic solvents (Ethanol, n-Propanol, iso-Propanol, n-Butanol, iso-Butanol, <b>Tertiary</b> <b>Butanol,</b> 1, 3 Propane-diol, Propylene Glycol and Glycerin), and drug sensitivity to radiation have been studied. Although the difference was not significant, the alkyl chain length and branching increased the reactivity of the solvent to radiation. Moreover, the number and 2 position of hydroxyl groups in the solvent structure have significantly increased its sensitivity to radiation which has been manifested as increased drug degradation. Using iso-propanol and <b>tertiary</b> <b>butanol</b> as free radical scavengers added to aqueous solution in different concentrations has shown variable protective effects for the drug against radiation. The role of different types of surfactants (Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Tween 80 and Benzalkonium Chloride) in drug protection against radiation in aqueous solutions suggested two different mechanisms. The first is the scavenging effect of the surfactant monomers below its CMC. Above CMC, a second mechanism may be involved, where the drug is expected to be located inside the formed micelles to different extents according to its affinity to the surfactant leading to more stabilization of the drug. The protective effect of surfactants was found to be in the order : Sodium Lauryl Sulphate > Tween 80. Benzalkonium Chloride. The effect of different types of gel forming polymers on drug sensitivity to gamma radiation was investigated. At low concentration of the polymers (1 %w/w), irradiation resulted in scission of their molecular structure, leading to production of fractionated species which compete with the drug for interaction with the radiolytic products of water. The net result was the indirect slight protection of the drug. At higher polymer concentration (gel forming concentration), the drug degradation by radiation was nearly the same as in 1 % polymer solutions. Moreover, the gel viscosity was considerably decreased by radiation to nearly fluid state in cases of Methyl Cellulose, and Hydroxpropyl Methylcellulose, while increased in cases of Polyvinyl Alcohol and Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone, which is due to the differences in chemical structures of polymers and their ability to cross-linking by radiation. It was also evident that the intermolecular cross-linking, which is responsible for the increasing viscosity in cases of PVA and PVP, was not sufficient to protect the drug from radiation. The polymers were cross-linked by exposing the polymer powder to different doses of radiation and were used to prepare gels containing a constant concentration of the drug. The degree of cross-linking (cross-linking ratio) was followed up through the measurement of gel viscosity. The drug stability was determined in different cross-linked polymers and {{it was found that the}} residual drug concentration was about 41 - 49 %, of the initial concentration, after exposure to 20 kGys of radiation. Polymer concentration is a critical factor in determining the extent of cross-linking by radiation. Therefore, different polymer concentrations were irradiated with 20 kGy (a sufficient radiation dose for maximum cross-linking of polymer powders) and the viscosities of the gels were measured before and after irradiation. The results showed that the maximum 3 polymer concentration producing the highest cross-linking ratio, while maintaining the gel consistency, was found to be 5 %, 4 %, 2 % and 2 % for MC, HPMC, PVA and PVP respectively. Above such concentrations, the gel was changed to a rigid mass. It was expected that the addition of a high concentration of Tween 80 to gels, would have two functions: The first is the interference with the cross-linking process by formation of hydrogen bonding at the sites of cross-linking, with the OH groups of the surfactant, leading to the capability to incorporate a higher amount of the polymer in the gel before reaching the maximum cross-linking (formation of a rigid mass). Secondly, the presence of Tween 80 in a high concentration would be expected to afford further protection to the drug by micellar inclusion. The results revealed that up to 8 %w/w of MC or HPMC and 5 %w/w of PVA or PVP could be incorporated in the gels containing 35 %w/w of Tween 80. Accordingly, a significant protective effect was achieved by the four types of polymers. However the highest protective effect was afforded by HPMC (95 %). This could be attributed to the high cross-linking ratio of HPMC compared to that of MC which afforded 90 % protection (due to the extra OH group in HPMC). On the other hand, the glycoside ring and the larger number of carbon atoms in HPMC, make the cross-linked units of HPMC more hydrophobic than PVA (93 %) and PVP. This would also explain the lower protective effect of PVP (only 62 %) which could be due to the hydrophilic nature of the cross-linked units compared to those of MC and HPMC. It can be concluded that the protective effect of the cross-linked polymers was determined by the net result of three factors: The first is the crosslinking ratio; the second is concentration of the polymer in the gel and third is the hydrophobicity of the matrix. Addition of 5 %w/w of iso-propanol had no significant effect on the protective effect of all the polymers (P > 0. 05) except that of PVP which was slightly improved. This could be attributed to an additional scavenging effect of iso-propanol. It is obvious that the protection of the drug against radiation necessitates its presence in a hydrophobic medium such as the core of micelles and/or imbedded into a highly crosslinked polymer structure. The incorporation of the drug into a Microemulsion (ME), where the oil content as well as the high concentration of surfactant would offer the required hydrophobic medium for drug protection against radiation. Therefore the ME would be expected to be an alternative design for drug protection. The ME was constructed to contain the highest amount of water so that when applied into the aqueous medium of the eye, in situ gelling will occur. This formulation will combine both the simplicity of handling and dosing ME as eye drops, in 4 which the drug is solubilized, and the continuous and prolonged drug effect due to the in situ gelling. This would be expected to be superior to the marketed 1 % ophthalmic suspension which may suffer from complicated preparation, physical stability and ocular irritation. The formulated ME showed excellent protection for Prednisolone against gamma radiation. This was evidenced by the absence of any change in the residual concentration of the drug even after exposure to 20 kGy of radiation. This protection could be explained on the basis that the drug is dissolved in a water free inverse micellar system, in addition to its partial solubility in the oily phase. This preferential distribution was supported by the poor solubility of the drug in water and low water content of the tested microemulsion system. The free radiolytic product of water would not be expected to penetrate the water oil interface. A slight reduction in the viscosity values was observed as a result of irradiation of the ME. This trend could be attributed to a little change in the alignment of the bilayer ME system due to a partial disruption of micellar structure at O/W interface or fragmentation of very small percent of paraffin oil by radiation. However, these minor changes did not affect the physical characteristics of ME system. A complete protection of the drug was afforded in petrolatum ointment base against radiation. This would be expected due the complete anhydrous environment either in paraffin oil or in petrolatum base. Consequently, no radiolytic free radicals would be produced. The only probable free radicals which could be produced are the long chain hydrocarbon free radicals through hydrogen atom abstraction, which are very weak to attack the drug. In addition, the drug is mainly suspended as solid particles (stable to radiation) in paraffin oil or petrolatum base. The viscosity of paraffin oil and petrolatum containing 0. 4 %w/w Prednisolone did not change by irradiation, which again confirm the absence of probability of any significant interaction between the paraffin oil or petrolatum base and gamma radiation. Therefore, Prednisolone can be safely sterilized by gamma radiation in both in situ gelling microemulsion and petrolatum ointment...|$|E
