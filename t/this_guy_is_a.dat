Listen to the song. <b>This</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> loser."

2500|$|The studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was {{initially}} not interested {{because he felt}} there were [...] "a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know {{if there was a}} way that would be interesting enough for this movie". After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a couple [...] of more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing [...] "a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. <b>This</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up". Furthermore, the actor felt that [...] "at heart he thinks he's Indiana Jones but the circumstances are always too much for him". Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. [...] "This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast".|$|E

2500|$|The 2005 season, Cutler's {{final year}} of play at Vanderbilt, was his most successful. As an 11-game starter, he {{completed}} 273 of 462 passes (59.1%) for 3,073 yards, 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions, as {{he became the first}} Commodore to win the SEC Offensive Player of the Year (coaches and media) since 1967. With his senior-season performance, Cutler became the second Commodore to throw for more than 3,000 yards in a season, while his 273 completions and 21 touchdowns ranked second on the school’s single-season list. He led the Commodores to victories over Wake Forest, Arkansas, Ole Miss, Richmond and Tennessee. The Commodores also scored the second most points ever (42) laid upon the Florida Gators at their current home field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Vanderbilt nearly upset the 13th-ranked Gators before falling 49–42 in the second overtime after a controversial excessive celebration call prevented the Commodores from going for 2 at the end of regulation.

Bauman <b>was</b> <b>a</b> baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story.

5000|$|Over the years, Mark Levine {{has been}} a tenacious, {{effective}} fighter against right wingnuts and for progressive values.
