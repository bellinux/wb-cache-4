30|$|<b>The</b> median <b>follow-up</b> was 3.5  years (0.5 – 7.5). Eight {{feet were}} graded as poor and one as fair at presentation. At <b>the</b> latest <b>follow-up,</b> <b>the</b> ICFSG score was {{excellent}} in 3 feet, good in 4 and fair in 2 feet. The median preoperative ICFSG score was 40 (26 – 45) and at <b>the</b> latest <b>follow-up</b> 7 (5 – 30).

30|$|On {{physical}} examination, {{both groups}} showed improvement in straight leg raise, knee extension, popliteal angle, and maximum knee extension in stance {{at the first}} post-op study, and maintained this improvement at <b>the</b> long-term <b>follow-up,</b> with <b>the</b> exception of straight leg raise, which slightly worsened in both groups at <b>the</b> final <b>follow-up.</b> Both groups improved maximum knee extension in stance at <b>the</b> initial <b>follow-up,</b> and maintained this at <b>the</b> long-term <b>follow-up.</b> Only <b>the</b> HST group showed significant (p <  0.05) improvement in the peak hip extension power in stance at the first post-op study, and this increased further at <b>the</b> final <b>follow-up.</b> In <b>the</b> HSL group, there was an initial slight decrease in the hip extension power, which subsequently increased to pre-operative values at the long-term study. Only the HST group showed increase of the average anterior pelvic tilt at <b>the</b> long-term <b>follow-up</b> study, although this was small in magnitude. There were two subjects who developed knee recurvatum at the post-op study, and both were in the HST group.|$|R

30|$|Secondly, {{in terms}} of voxel-by-voxel mapping of tumoral 18 [*]F-FDG uptake between {{different}} PET time points, <b>the</b> original <b>follow-up</b> dataset was aligned to the baseline PET/CT (which {{was used for the}} lesion statistics). An elastix deformable image registration was performed again to realign <b>the</b> warped <b>follow-up</b> dataset back with <b>the</b> original <b>follow-up</b> dataset. <b>The</b> aim is to assess to which extent <b>the</b> original <b>follow-up</b> tumor uptake values is preserved by applying image registration using the elastix toolbox. If there were any large discrepancies (i.e., < 80 % alignment using ΔSUV), we further investigated the reason for this low alignment percentage.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following a closed wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). A total of 16 TKAs were performed in 13 patients who had previously undergone a closed wedge HTO. The clinical results were reviewed using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score. The radiographic results were evaluated with respect to the femorotibial angle (FTA), joint line height (JLH) and tibial bone resection. The average HSS score before TKA was 63. 6, which improved to 92. 8 at <b>the</b> last <b>follow-up.</b> <b>The</b> FTA averaged varus 0. 9 ˚ preoperatively and valgus 5. 7 ˚ at <b>the</b> last <b>follow-up.</b> <b>The</b> JLH averaged 13. 9  mm preoperatively and 15. 6  mm at <b>the</b> last <b>follow-up.</b> <b>The</b> amount of tibial bone resection averaged 4. 8  mm. A meticulous surgical technique can produce satisfactory results in TKA after HTO, considering the correction of the deformity, JLH and the amount of the tibial bone resection...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{analyzed}} the clinical and radiologic results {{of patients with}} spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee treated by minimally invasive medial unicompartmental arthroplasty using Oxford Uni. Methods: We reviewed 22 knees in 21 patients which were treated for spontaneous osteonecrosis between 2002 and 2006. Patients included one male and 20 females. The mean age was 70. 8 years (range, 53 to 82 years). <b>The</b> mean <b>follow-up</b> period was 70. 3 months (range, 48 to 93 months).
