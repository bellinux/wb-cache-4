5|$|Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR): Multiple rocket {{launches}} (up to 15 in some plans) {{would carry}} {{parts of a}} Direct Ascent spacecraft and propulsion units for translunar injection (TLI). <b>These</b> <b>would</b> be assembled into a single spacecraft in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes {{were to be}} carried. Four of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> {{be mounted}} inside the hull below the {{waterline}}, two at {{either side of the}} bow; the others would be above the waterline at the stern, two at either side.|$|E
5|$|In 1462, the {{exchequer}} {{was told}} to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as <b>these</b> <b>would</b> be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.|$|E

50|$|On 3 December, the Interior Minister Petteri Orpo {{announced}} that special repatriation centers <b>would</b> be established. <b>These</b> centers <b>would</b> be inhabited by the asylum seekers whose applications were declined.

5|$|Konnan {{made two}} final {{appearances}} for World Wrestling All-Stars in May 2003, before the promotion folded. He also wrestled a tag match teamed with Norman Smiley for MXPW in September 2003. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> {{be his last}} extended stints in the independent circuit for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Many {{places in}} Norway farms also {{maintained}} mountain farms (seter/støl), where cows, goats, and sheep would put out to pasture {{during the summer}} months. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.|$|E

50|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, vast areas were conquered to Germany's east. At first <b>these</b> areas <b>would</b> remain under military occupation by Wehrmacht authorities, {{but as soon as}} the military situation allowed it, a more permanent form of administration under German rule for <b>these</b> territories <b>would</b> be instituted.|$|R

5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of <b>these</b> <b>would</b> be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> have left their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and this fact would explain also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E

5|$|Among the Selfe family {{papers in}} Mitchell Library {{there is a}} large {{collection}} of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by friends and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, un-postmarked, were collected on his travels in 1884-85. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, the Indonesians {{planned to}} {{increase}} their activity against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit Knuckle areas, while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and <b>these</b> <b>would</b> later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, <b>these</b> <b>would</b> burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber threat was greater than submarines, and the {{decision}} was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by EKCO (E.K. Cole). <b>These</b> <b>would</b> be turned into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E
5|$|Ballot papers {{proposing a}} {{national}} strike were {{sent out to}} union members on 17 September. On 8 October {{it was announced that}} postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. The first round of strikes were later scheduled for Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> consist of two 24-hour stoppages, with mail centre staff and drivers striking on 22 October and delivery and collection staff doing likewise the following day.|$|E
5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. <b>These</b> <b>would</b> make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade, which would help create the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated {{in the second half}} of the century.|$|E

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how <b>these</b> <b>would</b> affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} <b>these</b> <b>would</b> include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
