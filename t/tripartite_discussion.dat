It does so with particular attention to: the spatial politics of food deserts, food security, and food justice movements; the socialities of food identities; and the embodiments of food. This <b>tripartite</b> <b>discussion</b> of the social geographies of food is intended to highlight the complex theoretical and methodological approaches that geographers are employing when interrogating this particular object...|$|E

The right to form trade unions has existed since 2002, although only one national trade union centre is recognised, and other rights are still limited. The General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions held its founding congress in January 2004 and in December became the first organisation in the Gulf States to {{become a member of the}} ICFTU. It has been actively involved in <b>tripartite</b> <b>discussions,</b> including on labour legislation.|$|R

2500|$|Angelos was a {{representative}} of the Orioles franchise in the <b>tripartite</b> <b>discussions</b> between the team, the Cuban government, and the United States government and several of its agencies that culminated in the historic games between the Orioles and the Cuban National Baseball Team at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and in Havana, Cuba in March 1999. He and his brother, attorney Louis Angelos, led a delegation of team and baseball officials to Havana to negotiate the final agreement for the two-game series. Critics point out that this was a testament to Angelos' far left-wing ideology and sympathy for the Castro Brothers' hard line left-wing authoritarian regime.|$|R
50|$|When the Conference {{opened on}} June 12, 1933, all {{attention}} {{rested on the}} <b>tripartite</b> currency <b>discussions</b> happening outside the Conference. The big issue was the exchange rate of the dollar against foreign currencies such as the British pound and French franc. Many in the U.S. favored devaluation of the dollar to improve the U.S. trade position; France and Britain wanted to stabilize the dollar rate; i.e. fix it at a relatively high value.|$|R
25|$|Germany {{marched into}} Prague on 15 March 1939. In mid-April, the Soviet Union, Britain and France began trading {{diplomatic}} suggestions regarding {{a political and}} military agreement to counter potential further German aggression. Poland {{did not participate in}} these talks. The <b>tripartite</b> <b>discussions</b> focused on possible guarantees to participating countries should German expansionism continue. The Soviets did not trust the British or the French to honour a collective security agreement, because they had already failed to react against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and protect Czechoslovakia from dismemberment. The Soviet Union also suspected that Britain and France would seek to remain on the sidelines of any potential Nazi-Soviet conflict. In reality however, Stalin had been conducting secret talks with Nazi Germany already since 1936 through his emissaries, and all along a deal with Hitler remained his first diplomatic choice, wrote Robert C. Grogin (author of Natural Enemies). The Soviet Union sought nothing short of an ironclad guarantee against losing its sphere of influence, and insisted on stretching the so-called buffer zone from Finland to Romania, {{in the event of an}} attack. The Soviets demanded the right to enter these countries in the event of a security threat. When the military talks began in mid-August, negotiations quickly stalled over the topic of Soviet troop passage through Poland if the Germans attacked. British and French officials pressured Polish government to agree to the Soviet terms. However, Polish officials bluntly refused to allow Soviet troops in Poland. They believed that once the Red Army entered Poland it might never leave. The Soviets suggested that Poland's wishes be ignored, and that the tripartite agreements be concluded despite its objections. The British refused to do so because they believed that such a move would push Poland into establishing stronger bilateral relations with Germany.|$|R

When the CJC declined to dialogue with Arabs, meetings between the CAF and the CCC alone continued on for eight months, ending with agreement {{on the need to}} educate Canadians to dispel anti-Arab stereotyping. For the churches, there was also recognition of the need to formulate a clear policy on Southwest Asia situation.|$|R

La principale est la Convention no 111, de 1958, aujourd'hui ratifiée par 107 pays; elle a été complétée {{par la suite}} par d'autres instruments concernant des causes de discrimination qui n'étaient pas pleinement couvertes par la convention no 111. L'étude montre les précisions qui ont été apportées à la définition de la discrimination et à la détermination des mesures à prendre pour son élimination dans l'action des organes de contrôle de l'application des conventions et dans le développement des activités pratiques de l'OIT. The {{elimination of}} discrimination and the promotion of equality of opportunity in employment today occupy an important place in the standards and programmes of action of the ILO. They reflect a growth of concern for fundamental human rights in the field of labour, a concern which was initially directed towards protection against abusive working conditions, the elimination of forced labour and guaranteeing trade union rights and collective bargaining. It was, in fact, with the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) that the ILO first clearly indicated this new orientation. Subsequently, it has been put into effect through a number of Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO, as well as through its various action programmes. The broadest standards evoked are those of the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention no. 111 and Recommendation no. 111, adopted in 1958. The impact of such measures is evident from many revealing signs of their influence based on public discussion, serious technical study and moral authority. L'impact des conventions et recommandations internationales du travail, BIT, 1977. The number of ratifications, the effects — both dissuasive and corrective — of the monitoring Systems, and the reference instruments which the ILO standards and other publications constitute for employers' and workers' organizations, including the trade unions, are different aspects of this impact. The development of standards and activities on the basis of <b>tripartite</b> <b>discussions</b> and reciprocal verification among governments, employers and workers at the international level can certainly be regarded as a sound means, not only of expressing these requirements and demands, but also of helping to translate them in national situations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study that {{addresses}} both the stationary properties of the energy current and quantum correlations in a three-mode chain subjected to Ohmic and super-Ohmic dissipa- tions. An extensive numerical analysis shows that the mean value and the fluctuations of the energy current remain insensitive {{to the emergence of}} a rich variety of quantum correlations: such as, two-mode discord and entanglement, bipartite three-mode and genuine <b>tripartite</b> entanglement. The <b>discussion</b> of the numerical results is based on the derived expressions for the stationary properties in terms of the two-time correlation functions of the oscillator operators, which carry quantum correlations. Interestingly, we show that quantum discord can be enhanced by both considering initially squeezed thermal bath states and imposing temperature gradients. Comment: Comments are welcom...|$|R
40|$|A cidadania participativa Ã tema de investigaÃÃo junto ao Conselho de Turismo do PÃlo Costa das Dunas, esfera pÃblica {{tripartite}} de discussÃo e deliberaÃÃo que faz parte da estrutura institucional do Programa de Desenvolvimento do Turismo do Nordeste â Prodetur/NE-II. AtravÃs do mÃtodo estudo de caso, realizou-se pesquisa exploratÃria, que na tentativa de entender como Ã construÃda a participaÃÃo comunitÃria naquele espaÃo e de que modo ela Ã influenciada pelos limites e potencialidades do Prodetur/NE, amparou-se na hipÃtese de que no contexto do desenvolvimento turÃstico local, o capital social Ã elemento indispensÃvel e determinante nos rumos e na definiÃÃo deste, sobretudo quanto ao uso de todos os recursos endÃgenos como fator de competitividade do destino turÃstico. Neste sentido, entende-se que quanto mais consistente o capital social, melhores serÃo os resultados alcanÃados nas instituiÃÃes de representaÃÃo, e, portanto, mais efetiva serÃ a participaÃÃo cidadÃ. ConstataÃÃo revelada a partir da anÃlise dos resultados das opiniÃes expressadas por 74 entrevistados, de diferentes segmentos e representatividades do turismo do PÃlo Costa das Dunas. Com base nessas respostas, conclui-se que o espaÃo do Conselho poderÃ revelar-se inclusivo e participativo se trabalhadas suas fraquezas e fortalecido seu capital social a partir da divulgaÃÃo, da capacitaÃÃo (inclusive para conselheiros) e desenvolvimento de espaÃos locais integradores, que potencializem no indivÃduo um cidadÃo participante. Participative {{citizenship is}} an investigation subject under the Dunes Coast Tourism Council, a public <b>tripartite</b> environment of <b>discussion</b> and deliberation {{which is part}} of the institutional structure of Northeastâs Tourism Development Program - Prodetur/NE, in its second phase. Through a study case methodology, there has been made an exploratory research that, in the attempt to understand how communitarian participation is built in that space and in which way it is influenced by the limits and potentialities of Prodetur/NE, it has relied on the hypothesis that, in the context of local tourism development, social capital is essential and determining the direction and the definition of this, especially with the use of all resources as endogenous factor of competitiveness of tourist destination. Accordingly, it is understood that the more consistent the social capital, the better the results achieved in the institutions of representation, and therefore will be more effective citizenship participation. A revealed confirmation as from the resultâs analysis of the opinions expressed by 74 interviewed people, from different segments and representatives of the Dunes Coast Tourism Council. Based on these answers, it has been concluded that the Councilâs space can be revealed inclusive and participative, if its weaknesses are worked out and its social capital is strengthened as from the divulgation, training (also for the councilâs members) and development of local integrator spaces, that potentizes a participant citizen in the inner individuals...|$|R
