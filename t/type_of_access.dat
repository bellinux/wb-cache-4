25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} types {{of access to}} food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere. Location can affect access to food and which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> a family will rely on. The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household's access to food. However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services. Demographics and education levels {{of members of the}} household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that are purchased. A household's access to enough and nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake of all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household. The USDA adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a set of}} {{participants}} that is partitioned into distinct compartments, a multipartite access structure is an access structure that does not distinguish between participants that {{belong to the same}} compartment. We examine here three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> such <b>access</b> structures: two that were studied before – compartmented access structures and hierarchical threshold access structures, and a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> compartmented <b>access</b> structures that we present herein. We design ideal perfect secret sharing schemes for these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> structures that are based on bivariate interpolation. The secret sharing schemes for the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> compartmented <b>access</b> structures are based on bivariate Lagrange interpolation with data on parallel lines. The secret sharing scheme for the hierarchical threshold access structures are based on bivariate Lagrange interpolation with data on lines in general position. The main novelty of this paper is the introduction of bivariate Lagrange interpolation and its potential power in designing schemes for multipartite settings, as different compartments may be associated with different lines in the plane. In particular, we show that the introduction of a second dimension may create the same hierarchical effect as polynomial derivatives and Birkhoff interpolation were shown to do in [13]...|$|R

This paper explores pool design, specifically the design <b>of</b> the <b>access</b> to the tank, which is key for a pools inclusivity. In trying to break down existing barriers between users, accessibility experts and designers, we interviewed physically impaired architects about their perception <b>of</b> four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> pool <b>access</b> often used by wheelchair users; ramps, transfer walls, transfer systems and lifts. The interviews revealed limitations in all four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> pool <b>access.</b> Therefore, combining different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> in one single pool may be of interest in finding a balance between the limitations identified. Moreover, the interviews allowed to identify another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> pool <b>access,</b> designed by one of the interviewees: an upper pool border connected to an underwater bed and seat, which allows for an easier exit than transfer walls and transfer systems. Another interviewee advanced the idea of a cane holder for physically and visually impaired people, which may contribute to freeing poolside floors from obstacles and reducing the risk of falls. All these insights may contribute to make pool design more inclusive, by accommodating specific temporary or permanent needs related to the mobility of all of us. status: accepte...|$|R

No factors, however, is considered for the potential change of signalized intersections capacity caused by the access point closeing to the signalized intersection. This paper presented a theoretical model to estimate the lane group capacity at signalized intersections with the consideration of the effects <b>of</b> <b>access</b> points. Two scenarios <b>of</b> <b>access</b> point locations, upstream or downstream of the signalized intersection, and impacts <b>of</b> six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> traffic flow are taken into account.

Results of extensive numerical analysis reveal the substantial impact <b>of</b> <b>access</b> point on the capacity, which has an inverse correlation with both the number of major street lanes and {{the distance between the}} intersection and access point. Moreover, among the six <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> traffic flows, the access traffic flow 1 (right-turning traffic from major street), flow 4 (left-turning traffic from access point), and flow 5 (left-turning traffic from major street) cause a more significant effect on lane group capacity than others.
