50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} a concrete support base for the proposed display cabinet that is to hold the Stepney armorial dinner service, a large trench had to be excavated in {{the centre of the}} room, which offered archaeology the opportunity to evaluate the floor deposits below the 17th-century floor level more thoroughly than was possible for the already re-opened <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> in this room. Excavations for this trench revealed that approximately 0.35 m below the 17th-century floor was an earlier floor level of compacted orange/buff coloured clay. This surface had been covered over with a loose demolition deposit of soil/sand, lime mortar and wall plaster, which in turn had been compacted with earth. Initially it was thought that this compacted clay floor was the natural clay, however a small <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> was sunk through this deposit, which showed that the compacted clay floor was approximately 0.10 m thick and was covering a dark soil intermixed with irregular shaped stones. Luckily, positioning of the small <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> happened to be positioned directly over a small post-hole, approximately 0.20 m in diameter and 0.30 m deep, filled with the same loose dark soil material.

The re-opening and re-investigation {{of a series of}} <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> dug by engineers in the late 20th century, in two of these rooms had already revealed that below the present floor surface was a series of three earlier occupation layers, defined by layers of alternating demolition and construction deposits, with natural clay not being reached until approximately 3 ft below the present floor level. Finds recovered from the upper most occupation layer of one of these <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> (The Great Hall) included several large fragments of 17th-century decorative plasterwork, suggesting that parts of the 17th-century house had been demolished and the floor level raised to the present height.|$|E

50|$|While {{other areas}} of the South Wales {{coalfield}} had been exploited up to 50 years earlier, due to the scarcity and difficult access conditions of Rhondda Fach, it remained largely undeveloped. But the demand for steam coal drove development and, in 1874, Mordecai Jones of Brecon and Nantmelyn purchased the mineral rights around the farmhouse and its surrounding lands from the estate of the late Crawshay Bailey for £122,000. Additional capital was provided by a partner, J. R. Cobb, and a <b>trial</b> <b>pit</b> was sunk in 1875.|$|R
50|$|Geotechnical Investigations use near-surface {{geophysics}} as {{a standard}} tool, both for initial site characterisation and to gauge where to subsequently undertake intrusive site investigation (S.I.) which involves boreholes and <b>trial</b> <b>pits.</b> In rural areas conventional SI methods may be employed but in urban areas or in difficult sites, targeted geophysical techniques can rapidly characterise a site for follow-up, intensive surface or near-surface investigative methods. Most common is searching for buried utilities and still-active cables, cleared building foundations, determining soil type(s) and bedrock depth below ground level, solid/liquid waste contamination, mineshafts and relict mines below ground locations and even differing ground conditions. Indoor geophysical investigations have even been undertaken. Techniques will vary depending upon the target and host materials as already mentioned.|$|E
50|$|For about 10 years trial digs {{were driven}} northwards and {{northeast}} into the mountain, work that employed up to 42 miners. Prospecting {{was not only}} carried out {{at the level of}} the surface galleries, but also at a depth of 170 m at the face of the Sieber gallery, (the drainage gallery of the St. Andreasberg mining field). From the Wennsglückter lode from where the tunnel was long enough, the 700 m long Bär cross passage was built running northwards. Despite the driving of <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> with a total length of about 4 km it did not prove economical to recoverable the ore reserves. The weak and relatively low metal-poor lodes (Hermannsglücker, Wilhelmsglücker and Ernst lodes) that were discovered turned out at least to be mineralogically very interesting. Highlights include the arsenide nickel-cobalt ores, and a complex composition of selenide mineralizations.|$|E
50|$|The {{trial pit}} in Sir Thomas Stepney’s Study however told a very {{different}} story from the re-opened <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> in the former Great Hall and the south-western range. This trial pit revealed that the under-floor material was a single fill deposit characterised by demolition material of small stones, mortar and soil. An interesting feature exposed in this preliminary trial pit was a narrow north to south aligned stone built cross wall, which was partly supporting the present floor joists. This trial pit reached a depth of approximately 3 ft. The fact that the fill of this trial pit was all one deposit, suggested that the floor level in this room had been raised only once and raised a considerable height. It also suggested the possible existence of an earlier low basement area {{in this part of the}} house.|$|E
40|$|Network Rail has {{recently}} acquired High Output Ballast Cleaners (HOBC) {{to increase the}} effectiveness and output of track renewals in the UK. One {{of the most important}} criteria to ensure efficient programming, correct application and utilisation of the HOBC plant is to accurately predict the volume of ballast returned to track and the subsequent amount of new ballast required for the renewal. Therefore, the rate of return of ballast to the track needs to be determined accurately prior to any renewal using HOBC. This paper presents an extensive site investigation to evaluate ballast return on a planned HOBC site. Current recommended site investigation methods to evaluate ballast return, utilising <b>trial</b> <b>pitting</b> and sub-sampling are discussed. It was considered that a more rigorous approach should be adopted to identify locations along the track that give a more representative sample for ballast return assessment. It was also noted that pitting and sub-sampling is time consuming and is subject to human error. Thus, Automatic Ballast Sampling (ABS) was conducted in addition to the more traditional methods of sample recovery in a closely monitored site investigation. The predicted ballast recovery results based on both the ABS and <b>trial</b> <b>pitting</b> are compared and discussed, and the relative merits of both techniques identified...|$|R

50|$|This {{section is}} more {{specific}} {{with regard to}} how the ground is investigated using methods such as excavating or drilling. Frequency of sampling and testing can be decided with the following in mind, {{the determination of the}} character and structure of all the strata and ground water conditions, the determination of the properties of the strata and the use of special techniques should ‘normal’ techniques not give satisfactory results. Shallow <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> go to a maximum depth of 4-5 metres, comprehensive records should include the location and orientation of the pit and the face logged. Samples should be taken as soon as the pit is opened and closed as soon as possible properly - there are however advantages to leaving them open for a time. Samples are taken from deep <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> and shafts at certain sites if necessary and if below the water table can become a more complicated process. Boring augers are in common use. There are two types of rotary drilling, open hole drilling and core drilling. The selection of the type and method used can depend on ground conditions and time and cost constraints. Recovered cores should be maintained as near as possible to its natural state until it is stored. In most cases it is inevitably disturbed. Another method is wash boring which is most applicable to sands, silts, and clays. However, these are not representative of the character and consistency of the penetrated strata. Ground water conditions are determined from water level in boreholes and the use of standpipe, hydraulic, electrical and pneumatic piezometers. Water samples should be representative and stored in appropriate containers. Backfilling should be well compacted to obviate the flow of groundwater to any aquifer below and/or settlement. The use of cement based grout can be used - bentonite is also used to decrease shrinkage. Sampling quality can be classified to determine depending on their disturbance and other factors such as, wet or dry ground. Samplers should conform to the standard. Sampling takes different forms i.e. - continuous sampling, the sand and window sampler and block sampling. Due to the cost of sample acquisition, samples should be treated with great care. Good methods of handling and labelling should be established.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} occurs as galleries, or drifts (headings). This form of mining {{utilizes}} horizontal or nearly horizontal (slightly declined) shafts for ore extraction from sandstone or crag. Drifts and galleries {{are the most}} widespread type of mining form in Kargaly. The form {{and size of the}} galleries is not fixed, but flexible depending on the composition of the ore layers and the different characteristics of the deposit. These criteria are assessed by the miners during underground and surface gophering for copper minerals. This variability explains the changes in form and size of galleries, which often have no regular geometric profile and no strict direction. The predominance of the so-called nest, or lens accumulations of copper minerals in Kargaly led to the appearance of huge underground halls derived from galleries. Their ceilings are twenty meters high and are connected to other galleries and drifts. In some cases they were blind underground headings (strecks). Prospecting or <b>trial</b> <b>pits</b> are laid into the loam surface layer for the clearing of subsoil and are created in order to search for traces of copper minerals. The copper deposits are usually surrounded by residue of argillaceous soil and sandy loam.|$|E
