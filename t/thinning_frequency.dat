40|$|International audienceA novel {{framework}} is {{proposed for the}} estimation of multiple sinusoids from irregularly sampled time series. This spectral analysis problem is addressed as an under-determined inverse problem, where the spectrum is discretized on an arbitrarily <b>thin</b> <b>frequency</b> grid. As we focus on line spectra estimation, the solution must be sparse, i. e. the amplitude of the spectrum must be zero almost everywhere. Such prior information is taken into account within the Bayesian framework. Two models are used {{to account for the}} prior sparseness of the solution, namely a Laplace prior and a Bernoulli Gaussian prior, associated to optimization and stochastic sampling algorithms, respectively. Such approaches are efficient alternatives to usual sequential prewhitening methods, especially in case of strong sampling aliases perturbating the Fourier spectrum.

40|$|As an {{extension}} of previous treatments of polarized radiation transfer in homogeneous synchrotron sources, a transfer procedure is derived, based on the coupled-wave formulation, which allows consideration of inhomogeneous sources. It is shown that plasma characteristic wave eccentricities in a source must be fairly large unless Faraday rotation per absorption depth is very large, and that coupling between characteristic waves can be strong in inhomogeneous self-absorbed sources. Calculations are made of the polarized radiation emergent from a source with a boundary of finite thickness. It is found that neglect of propagation effects in the source boundary introduces no significant errors at optically <b>thin</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but that below the self-absorption turnover the emergent polarization may depend significantly upon such effects. In particular, {{the sign of the}} circular polarization and the linear polarization position angle depend upon the absorption depth in the boundary region...|$|R
40|$|The center-to-limb {{variation}} {{of both the}} spectral and spatial brightness distributions is investigated using a series of microwave observations of a sunspot in the active region NOAA 4741. Depending on the heliocentric position of the sunspot, the microwave emission appears in two typical profiles: either a ring structure {{near the center of}} the disk or a single-peak structure near the limb. Due to the increase of the gyroresonance opacity of the field lines near the spot center as the viewing angle increases, the brightness temperature at high, optically <b>thin</b> <b>frequencies</b> increases slightly as the spot approaches the limb. In addition, a change of effective harmonic, which accompanies a discontinuous change in the degree of polarization, characterizes the center-to-limb {{variation of}} the gyroresonance spectrum. Finally, the height of the gyroresonance layer, low in the corona of the active region, is determined from a change of spectrum from gyroresonance to free-free emission as the spot passes over the solar limb...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{upconversion}} of laser-generated photons by inverse Compton scattering {{for applications}} such as nu-clear spectroscopy and gamma-gamma collider concepts on the future ILC would benefit from an increase of av-erage source brightness. The primary obstacle to higher average brightness is the relatively small Thomson scatter-ing cross section. It has been proposed that this limitation can be partially overcome by use of laser pulse recircu-lation. The traditional approach to laser recirculation en-tails resonant coupling of low-energy pulse train to a cavity through a partially reflective mirror [1]. Here we present an alternative, passive approach that is akin to ”burst-mode” operation and does not require interferometeric alignment accuracy. Injection of a short and energetic laser pulse is achieved by placing a <b>thin</b> <b>frequency</b> converter, such as a nonlinear optical crystal, into the cavity {{in the path of}} the incident laser pulse.

40|$|The {{research}} activity, {{illustrated in}} this work, {{has been developed}} {{in the area of}} applied electromagnetics and it concerns the development and the improvement of a hybrid numerical method combining the Mode Matching (MM) and the Finite Element (FE) specifically derived for the study of complex microwave devices. Firstly, the optimization problem of unconventional Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs), obtained by using NURBS curves, is analyzed. A genetic algorithm is used in order to address the optimization of a multiparametric structure such as the FSS. The hybrid method MM-FE is used to evaluate the frequency behaviour of this kind of structures. The hybrid technique is therefore applied to the study of large finite arrays of open-ended or iris-loaded waveguide apertures or horn antennas. The finite dimensions are taken into account by using a Spectral Decomposition (SD) approach that allows us to reduce the finite problem to a summation of infinite periodic ones. A similar procedure, now based on the Method of Moments (MoM) and the spectral decomposition approach, is applied to the analysis of finite <b>thin</b> <b>frequency</b> selective surfaces. Finally the hybrid methodology MM-FEM-SD, combined with an MoM, is used to study finite arrays of rectangular waveguide cascaded with a finite thin FSS.

Mod. Phys. 59 [[URL] 175). The penetration of LH waves at higher densities has recently been reviewed (Goniche et al 2010 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 52 [[URL] 124031) in order to assess the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) performance under conditions {{as close as possible to}} the ITER SS scenario. The analysis of various experiments performed on C-Mod, FTU, Tore Supra and JET indicates (Goniche et al 2010 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 52 [[URL] 124031) a degradation of the current drive (CD) efficiency when the plasma density is increased, while at the same time the LH wave absorption shifts to the plasma periphery. JET pulses in H-mode confirm this trend and in addition it is found that the accessibility condition is not the main parameter to explain the reduction in the CD efficiency. This paper further discusses the LH deposition in H-mode plasmas and in particular it shows that lower pedestal density and higher temperature are beneficial regarding the LH wave penetration.

40|$|The U. S. D. I. Office of Surface Mining (OSM) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} approximately 1 million acres of abandoned mine land (AML) in the Appalachian region. AML lands are classified as areas that were inadequately reclaimed or were left unreclaimed prior {{to the passage of}} the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, and where no federal or state laws require any further reclamation responsibility to any company or individual. Reclamation and afforestation of these sites have the potential to provide landowners with cyclical timber revenues, generate environmental benefits to surrounding communities, and sequester carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Through a memorandum of understanding, the OSM and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) have decided to investigate reclaiming and afforesting these lands for the purpose of mitigating the negative effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This study determined the carbon sequestration potential of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), one of the major reclamation as well as commercial species, planted on West Virginia AML sites. Analyses were conducted to (1) calculate the total number of tons that can be stored, (2) determine the cost per ton to store carbon, and (3) calculate the profitability of managing these forests for timber production alone and for timber production and carbon storage together. The Forest Management Optimizer (FORMOP) was used to simulate growth data on diameter, height, and volume for northern red oak. Variables used in this study included site indices ranging from 40 to 80 (base age 50), <b>thinning</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 0, 1, and 2, thinning percentages of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40, and a maximum rotation length of 100 years.

So, their acoustic absorption ability is naturally limited {{to medium and}} high frequencies because of constraints in thickness. The ratio "plate thickness / hole diameter" usually centred around 1 generates impedance levels dependent on the incident sound pressure level (SPL) and on the grazing mean flow (by a nonlinear dissipation mechanism of vortex shedding), which penalises the optimal design of liners. Moreover, their physical law is not suited to an absorption to the lowest frequencies, as needed for future Ultra High Bypass Ratio engines with shorter and <b>thinner</b> nacelles (<b>frequencies</b> around 500 Hz).
