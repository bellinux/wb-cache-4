This dysfunction leads to many short- and long-term complications. In this paper, {{a system for}} tele-monitoring and <b>tele-management</b> of Type 1 diabetes patients is proposed, aiming at {{reducing the risk of}} diabetes complications and improving quality of life. The system integrates Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), mobile infrastructure, and Internet technology along with commercially available and novel glucose measurement devices, advanced modeling techniques, and tools for the intelligent processing of the available diabetes patients information. The integration of the above technologies enables intensive monitoring of blood glucose levels, treatment optimisation, continuous medical care, and improvement of quality of life for Type 1 diabetes patients, without restrictions in everyday life activities. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
