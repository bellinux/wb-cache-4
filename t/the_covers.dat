50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cover</b> shown is <b>the</b> US/Canadian <b>cover,</b> {{which used}} <b>the</b> same Karl Ferris {{photograph}} but differed from <b>the</b> UK <b>cover</b> by dispensing with <b>The</b> Fool's overall <b>cover</b> design. Instead, <b>the</b> US/Canadian <b>cover</b> put <b>The</b> Hollies' name on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> in more conventional psychedelic-influenced lettering, placed the album title on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> {{in a normal}} font, and then overlaid a paisley-patterned image to be more consistent with US visions of psychedelia.|$|R

50|$|Semi-automatic covers use a {{motor-driven}} reel system. They use {{electrical power}} to roll and unroll <b>the</b> <b>cover,</b> but usually require someone {{to pull on}} <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> when unrolling, or guide <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> onto <b>the</b> reel when rolling up <b>the</b> <b>cover.</b> Semi-automatic covers can be built into the pool deck surrounding the pool, or can use reels on carts.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style.

5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
5|$|Escher's art became {{well known}} among {{scientists}} and mathematicians, and in popular culture, especially {{after it was}} featured by Martin Gardner in his April 1966 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters {{in order to improve}} his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in <b>the</b> <b>covers.</b> With Australia boasting the leg spin pairing of O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in the leg trap position.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThree {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was utilized to determine mode I stress intensity factor through {{the front of a}} single edge crack in main plate with welded <b>cover</b> plate. <b>The</b> numerical results showed that the ratio of the crack length to the position of <b>the</b> welded <b>cover</b> plate end is a crucial parameter for describing the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate location. When the crack tip just reached <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate end, <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate efficiency is only dependent on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate dimensions regardless the location of <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate or <b>the</b> crack length. In the case of crack front not reached <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate end, <b>the</b> location of <b>cover</b> plate near <b>the</b> edge of the main plate, i. e., near the crack mouth, is less efficient than that faraway. However, the opposite trend was found for cracks pass beneath <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> plate...|$|R
