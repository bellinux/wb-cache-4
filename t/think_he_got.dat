25|$|On August 13, 2007, {{regarding}} the February Las Vegas strip club incident, Jones told Bryant Gumbel of HBO Sports' Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel {{that he was}} innocent and had never hit the stripper or told anyone {{he was going to}} kill them. When asked about friend and convicted drug dealer Darryl Moore, Jones said that he did not know Moore was a drug dealer and felt surprised and betrayed. Jones also said he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a fair say in his April meeting with Goodell.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's son Jeff said: [...] "I {{truly believe}} he was tried and convicted by the media long {{before he went to}} trial. The media can pretty much convict you. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a fair trial." [...] After his execution, Chandler was {{described}} as the [...] "loneliest man in the loneliest place on earth, death row"; he did not receive a single visitor during his years in Florida's death row unit.|$|E
500|$|During Sean Connery's Bond films, the humour was {{delivered}} by Connery to soften a violent situation, {{such as the}} electrification, or his shooting a villain with a spear gun and saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the point". The humour changed towards innuendo and self-mockery during the Roger Moore films, with his jokes delivered with what media historian James Chapman {{considered to be a}} [...] "wink at the audience", with the suggestion that the violence was all a joke. This was shown in Live and Let Die when he threw the villain, Tee Hee, out of a train, removing his prosthetic arm in the process, Moore commented that he was [...] "Just being disarming, darling". When Timothy Dalton took the role, the humour was downplayed, bringing the character more in line with that of the novels. The humour returned for the Brosnan films, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'A chance!' says she. 'Well, <b>he</b> may <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has a chance; but I hope <b>he</b> won't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a cinch, {{after what}} he's been next {{to all the}} evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad and I never {{agree about}} a horse. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{the best of}} you. But you know, Macomber, what a horse-thief you are. Worse than Cordts!" ...|$|R
500|$|Kevin Reed, {{a friend}} of the band, set up the drums and {{lighting}} when touring with the band. Reed's father, Lawrence R. Reed drew the Minotaur with a sword on the album's cover. Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Once more Hank Stiger {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> afraid {{and went to}} Mexico. A good many people around Gonzales do not like him, and I think he was afraid I would expose him," [...] he ventured.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's unlucky, and {{it comes}} high. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a show for the nomination, but my dander's up, and I'll beat him if I have to {{mortgage}} my house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{rather a}} better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won't get {{much out of}} his spekilations, I <b>think.</b> <b>He's</b> <b>got</b> a pretty strong string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he's light, and don't {{come up to}} the captain's marks; but there's no {{knowing what}} disguises a fellow will put on. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> the captain's legs, and a man can't change his legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> on a {{small boat}} and went up the Pasig River. He is {{supposed}} to have a brother living in Santa Cruz on the Laguna de Bay. This brother is said to be in thorough sympathy with the insurgents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{drunk at}} all. There {{is no reason}} why he should, any more than William. Come along, and take me down to dinner. After all, papa's leg of mutton is better than Medora's apples, when one is as hungry as I am." ...|$|E
60|$|The horrified {{prisoner}} {{heard them}} pass downstairs again, and, after {{a glass of}} water, sat down by the window and tried to <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>got</b> up and tried the door, but it opened inwards, and after a severe onslaught the handle came off in his hand. Tired out at last {{he went to bed}} again, and slept fitfully until morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> {{a career}} before him," [...] said Serena; [...] "the House always fills when he's speaking, and that's a good sign. And then <b>he's</b> young and <b>got</b> rather an {{attractive}} personality, {{which is always}} something in the political world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Escape to Margaritaville is {{a musical}} about a {{part-time}} bartender, part-time singer, and full-time charmer named Tully who <b>thinks</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>got</b> life {{all figured out}} - until a beautiful career-minded tourist steals his heart and makes him question everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a rich Californian. <b>Thinks</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a 'call,' I reckon, to look arter Injins, just as them Abolitionists looked arter slaves. And get hated just as {{they was}} by the folks here,--and as WE are, too, for the matter of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> on to {{the fact}} that we were in Fernwood, and that it was his {{business}} to get out just as quickly as he could," [...] said Tom. [...] "And if that is true it is more than likely that he is a good distance away from here by now and keeping to side roads where he thinks he will not be followed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Link took 'em. He says he didn't mean {{to steal}} 'em, {{but that is}} what it {{amounted}} to. He took 'em, and while the storm was on some cattle-thieves, headed by Andy Andrews, came along. Link says Andrews and his gang took the horses away, but I think Link made a deal with the hoss-thieves, for the next day I see Link with a roll of bank-bills, and I know Mr. Merwell didn't give him the money. He had about two hundred dollars, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the wad from Andrews--on his promise not to open his mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were torn}} apart by a {{financial}} accident to my uncle of which I did not at first grasp the full bearings. He had developed what I regarded as an innocent intellectual recreation which he called stock-market meteorology. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the idea from one use of curves in the graphic presentation of associated variations that he saw me plotting. He secured some of my squared paper and, having cast about for a time, decided to trace {{the rise and fall}} of certain lines and railways. [...] "There's something in this, George," [...] he said, and I little dreamt that among other things that were in it, was the whole of his spare money and most of what my mother had left to him in trust for me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, that's nothing. You needn't {{worry about}} that. I daresay it'll turn to clothes or {{religion}} before he's done. People talk of funny things when they're in that state. He'll probably <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> two hundred pairs of trousers or a million pounds a year.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If he had,' said Kags, 'the dog 'ud {{want to lead}} us away {{to where}} he did it. No. I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> out of the country, and left the dog behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn't be so easy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, you-all had a {{nice little}} run," [...] Stillwell said, {{speaking}} generally. [...] "I reckon there wasn't much need of it. Pat Hawe <b>thinks</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> some outlaws corralled on the ranch. Nothin' at all to be fussed up about. Stewart's that particular he won't have you meetin' with any rowdies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about English generals, Father Brown," [...] {{answered}} the large man, laughing, [...] "though a little about English policemen. I only {{know that you have}} dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this fellow, whoever he is. One would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> buried in six different places. I've seen a memorial to General St. Clare in Westminster Abbey. I've seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St. Clare on the Embankment. I've seen a medallion of St. Clare in the street he was born in, and another in the street he lived in; and now you drag me after dark to his coffin in the village churchyard. I am beginning to be a bit tired of his magnificent personality, especially as I don't in the least know who he was. What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't explain it. As I said, the {{president}} {{tried to make}} me confess, and of course I had nothing to confess. When the telephone rang I heard one voice and then two others, one after another. I think they belonged to Koswell, Flockley and Larkspur, but I am not sure. The voices talked to Doctor Wallington about ten minutes. He got mad {{at first and then}} calmed down. I heard him ask, 'In Professor Sharp's room?' and somebody said 'Yes.' Four times he asked for names, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> them. Then he went out of the office and was gone about a quarter of an hour. When he returned he said, 'Now, on your honor, for the last time, Rover, did you mar that photograph?' and I said 'No,' good and hard. Then he said he believed me, and was sorry he had suspected me, and he added that I could go off {{for the rest of the}} day and enjoy myself, and here I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} the Arab {{understood}} just what I said, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the gist of it. He spoke sharp to his men, and they never touched us afterwards. I could not quite make out what they were taking us for, because I can say honestly we were not much good at carrying--not half as good {{as one of the}} slaves. The first day or two we carried a good manful load. Then our shoes went to pieces, and we got that footsore and bad we could scarcely crawl along, let alone carrying loads. Tom said he thought that the Arab was a-taking us to sell as curios to some fellow who had never seen white men before, and it turned out as he was right. After we had been travelling for nigh a month we came to a big village; and there was great excitement over our coming, and for two days there were feastings, while the Arab sold part of his goods to the people for gold dust and ivory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{you make}} a howling mistake," [...] Collins told them, [...] "that's when you all pull the wires like mad and poke the leader and whirl him around. That always brings down the house. They <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a real musical ear and is mad at his {{orchestra}} for the discord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> cancer, Doc.," [...] Daughtry said, while Kwaque {{was pulling}} {{off his shirt}} and undershirt. [...] "He never squealed, you know, never peeped. That's the way of niggers. I didn't find our till <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to wakin' me up nights with his tossin' about an' groanin' in his sleep.--There! What'd you call it? Cancer or tumour--no two ways about it, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was ever very lover-like,' Captain Armstrong said, savagely; 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has <b>got</b> it in him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She faced him squarely. [...] "No, he {{has been}} the real thing. He kept a saloon--when I first knew him, but he gave it all up for me. I wouldn't promise to marry him till he did. Everybody out there knows his career, and most people <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his money underhand, but he tells me he didn't, and I take his word. Every dollar he spends on me or on our home comes out of some mines he owns. I told him I wouldn't touch a dollar of the saloon money--and I won't. Some folks think I don't care, but I do. I don't like the saloon business, and he got out and he's livin' {{straight}} now, as straight as any man. It's pretty hard on him, too, though he won't admit it. He must get awful sick of sittin' round the way he does. I tell him he needn't cut out all his old cronies on my account. He says he ain't sufferin', but it's like shuttin' a bronco up in the corral and lettin' the herd go back into the hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|In this respect, {{his service}} to our prose {{was greater than}} any other man has ever rendered. He says he formed his style upon Tillotson's (Bossuet, on the other hand, formed his upon Corneille's); but I rather <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> it at Will's, for its great charm {{is that it has}} the various freedom of talk.[92] In verse, he had a pomp which, {{excellent}} in itself, became pompousness in his imitators. But he had nothing of Milton's ear for various rhythm and interwoven harmony. He knew how to give new modulation, sweetness, and force to the pentameter; but {{in what used to be}} called pindarics, I am heretic enough to think he generally failed. His so much praised [...] "Alexander's Feast" [...] (in parts of it, at least) has no excuse for its slovenly metre and awkward expression, but that it was written for music. He himself tells us, in the epistle dedicatory to [...] "King Arthur," [...] "that the numbers of poetry and vocal music are sometimes so contrary, that in many places I have been obliged to cramp my verses and make them ragged to the reader that they may be harmonious to the hearer." [...] His renowned ode suffered from this constraint, but this is no apology for the vulgarity of conception in too many passages.[93] ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with Billboard, Walker mentioned that producer Doug Johnson was crucial for the performance. Walker stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{everything there is to}} get out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I {{like the way he}} played it. ... I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a sense of humor and <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> some good things there." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw Reuben Camp {{climb the}} {{shoulders}} of a big fellow near where the Altrurian had stood; he waved the crowd to silence with out-spread arms. [...] "He isn't {{going to say anything}} more; he's tired. But if any man don't <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> his dollar's worth, let him walk up to the door and the ticket-agent will refund him his money." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "That was my sister's question, and I did answer it. Have some tea, ladies? I'm {{glad you}} like my portrait, and that you <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> my lovely turn of the head, and the way I hold my fan, and the {{character}} of my skirt; but I {{agree with you that}} it isn't half as pretty as I am." ...|$|R
