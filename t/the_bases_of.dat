5|$|Amanita ceciliae {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and Christopher Edmund Broome, a British mycologist, in 1854. It {{is placed in}} the genus Amanita and section Vaginatae. Section Vaginatae consists of mushrooms with special characteristics – such as the absence of a ring, and very few clamp connections at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the basidia.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> basidia.|$|E

5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> their legs; {{both of these}} features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{of all ages}} can be {{distinguished}} by {{the position of the}} two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, they are at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are {{at the base of the}} fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen. Mature females have a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. <b>The</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} striated muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Uniquely among chelicerates, {{the final}} {{sections}} of spiders' chelicerae are fangs, {{and the great}} majority of spiders can use them to inject venom into prey from venom glands in the roots of the chelicerae. The families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae, and some Liphistiidae spiders, have lost their venom glands, and kill their prey with silk instead. Like most arachnids, including scorpions, spiders have a narrow gut that can only cope with liquid food and spiders have two sets of filters to keep solids out. They use one of two different systems of external digestion. Some pump digestive enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the chelicerae and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species, the chelicerae and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E
50|$|The {{same process}} {{is used to}} measure <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree above or below eye level. If <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree is below eye level, then {{the height of the}} tree below eye level is added to the height above eye level. If <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree is above eye level, then <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree above eye level is {{subtracted}} from the height of the treetop above eye level. It may be difficult to directly measure the horizontal distance at eye level if that distance is high off the ground or if <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree is above eye level. In these cases the distance to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree can be measured using the tape along the slope from eye level to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree and noting the slope angle Θ. In this case <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree above or below eye level is equal to the (sin Θ x slope distance) and the horizontal distance to the tree is (cos Θ x slope distance).|$|R

5|$|Viewed in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the basidiospores of A.aestivalis are white. Examination with a {{microscope}} reveals further details: they are roughly spherical, hyaline (translucent) and thin-walled, with dimensions of 7.8–8.8µm. The spores are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent and appear blue to blackish-blue. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 32–60 long by 4–13µm thick. There are no clamps present at <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the basidia.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. <b>The</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
