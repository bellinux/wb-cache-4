40|$|Between 1888 and 1926, seventy nurse {{training}} schools {{opened in}} Nebraska. By 1938, fifty-seven were closed. The transformation of Nebraska nursing education from haphazardly organized apprenticeship programs {{in dozens of}} hospitals to highly organized programs in thirteen schools is of interest to educational, women 2 ̆ 7 s, medical, and Progressive Era historians. ^ Professional nursing, an occupation derived from women 2 ̆ 7 s domestic sphere, emerged {{at the height of}} an organizational revolution associated with Progressive Era emphases on workplace specialization, bureaucratization, standardization, and rationalization. The organizational revolution, legislative reform, and the professionalization ambitions of elite national and local nursing leaders shaped Nebraska nursing education before World War II, particularly through the office of the State Director of Nursing Education and through statutory specification of National League of Nursing Education curricula. (Nebraska was one of only three states to legally require NLNE standards). ^ <b>Training</b> school <b>record</b> <b>books</b> and Nebraska Board of Nursing inspection reports provided major sources of information about Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s nursing students and programs. Most Nebraska nursing students before World War II came from small towns and rural areas and entered urban training schools. Attrition rates hovered at fifty percent, and most students who left training were dismissed, without hearing, for minor rule infractions. Affiliation requirements formed an important part of training in smaller schools. For many years schools sent students to large general hospitals in Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City in order to meet state and NLNE standards. The thirteen training schools that survived tended to be well-organized and managed by a superintendent who had stayed with the school for several years. Nursing students 2 ̆ 7 education before entering training school gradually improved, as did student living conditions, health, and training school experiences, but some constants remained, notably school disciplinary methods and student exploitation as cheap labor offering a 2 ̆ 2 peculiar and valuable service 2 ̆ 2 to the hospital. ...|$|R

We hypothesised that patients who demonstrated evidence of self-testing by bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (capillary blood glucose monitoring diary) to clinic would have better glycaemic control than patients with a glucometer alone, or neither <b>record</b> <b>book</b> nor glucometer. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 233 consecutive type 1 diabetes patients using basal-bolus insulin. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within the previous year, current pregnancy, or prior inclusion in this study. We recorded {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer at the clinic, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and previous structured education attendance. Results: Of 233 patients, 90 brought a <b>record</b> <b>book,</b> 61 brought a glucometer and 82 brought neither. Mean HbA 1 c did not differ between patients with a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]) or glucometer (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]), but was higher in those with neither (77 ± 2 mmol/mol [9. 2 ± 0. 2 %]; p< 0. 001). Patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> were older on average than those with a glucometer or neither (49. 6 ± 1. 7 vs. 41. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 40. 6 ± 1. 4 years; p< 0. 001) and had longer mean duration of diabetes (27. 9 ± 2. 0 vs. 19. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 18. 7 ± 1. 6 years; p< 0. 001). Prior structured education did not predict the presence of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer in the clinic. Conclusions: Evidence of self-testing at clinic review, either as a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer, was associated with improved control compared with those with neither. HbA 1 c did not differ between patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer.
