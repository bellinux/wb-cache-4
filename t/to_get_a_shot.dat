5|$|Arsenal {{profited from}} a mistake Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Martin Hodge to {{progress}} to the semi-finals, {{where they were}} paired up against Everton. The first leg was staged at Goodison Park and saw the Arsenal players, rejuvenated by a five-day break in Marbella, come away with a 1–0 win. Groves scored the only goal of the match when he managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> in from Kenny Sansom's free kick.

25|$|According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), {{getting as}} many girls vaccinated as early and {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} will reduce the cases of cervical cancer among middle-aged women in 30 to 40 years and reduce the transmission of this highly communicable infection. Barriers include the limited understanding by many people that HPV causes cervical cancer, the difficulty of getting pre-teens and teens into the doctor's office <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> and the high cost of the vaccine ($120/dose, $360 total for the three required doses, plus the cost of doctor visits).

25|$|On May 7, 1995, Miller scored {{eight points}} in 8.9 seconds in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Knicks, leading the Pacers to a {{stunning}} 107–105 victory. With 18.7 seconds remaining and the Pacers trailing 105–99, Miller took the inbounds pass from Mark Jackson, made a 3-pointer, stole the inbounds pass from Anthony Mason, dribbled {{back behind the}} arc and tied the game with another 3, stunning the crowd at Madison Square Garden. On the ensuing possession, Knicks guard John Starks was fouled by Sam Mitchell. Starks missed both free throws, and although Patrick Ewing {{managed to get the}} offensive rebound, his shot was just a bit long and hit the back rim. Miller got the rebound and was fouled with 7.5 seconds left. He made both free throws. Trailing by 2, New York had one last chance to win the game, but failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> off, giving the Pacers a shocking 1–0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Pacers outlasted the Knicks in seven games before losing to the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals in seven games, just like the previous year. Near the end of the 1996 season, Miller fell to the floor and suffered an eye injury, leaving him unable to play in the playoffs until Game 5 of the first round against the Atlanta Hawks, where he wore goggles. The Pacers lost to the Hawks and were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Returning from Champion's League play, Lyon faced Rennes, who was {{responsible}} for the champions first loss of the season. The match remained even until the 66th minute when Kim Källström scored following a gifted pass from the youngster Miralem Pjanić. The scoreline remained until injury time when Rennes striker Jimmy Briand scored after receiving a nice through-ball which caught Lyon defender Cris off guard. Briand proceeded <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> on the ball off balance, which got past the charging Hugo Lloris to tie the match 1–1, the eventual final scoreline. Lyon followed this draw with a defeat taking on Lille, whom they had just contested three days ago in a Coupe de France tie. With the match being played at the Stade de France and the clubs entertaining a record crowd, Lyon fielded a pretty strong, yet questionable side with players Mathieu Bodmer and François Clerc returning from a long absence and also having the task of defeating Barcelona in Spain in the second leg of their Champion's League clash. In the match, Lyon failed constantly to get on the scoreboard with the former mastiff Kader Keïta missing on numerous opportunities. Lille made sure they made good on their chances with Róbert Vittek scoring the opening goal in the 60th minute and Michel Bastos finishing off Lyon, scoring the second goal in the 88th minute to pick up a 0–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E

40|$|Although {{correlational}} {{studies show}} {{a relationship between}} worry about health concerns and higher rates of self-protective behavior, {{there has been no}} experimental research supporting the relationship and little research on the mechanisms by which worry might lead to health behaviors. This study experimentally induced a state of worry about influenza in undergraduate college students (N = 165), and examined their intentions <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> flu <b>shot,</b> systematic processing of a message about influenza, and vaccination behavior. The study had four main findings. First, the worry induction was successful in inducing worry about influenza. Second, participants in the experimental (worry) group reported significantly greater intentions <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> flu <b>shot</b> when compared with the intentions of the control group. Group differences in vaccination behavior were in the predicted direction, but were not significant. Third, participants in the experimental group had significantly higher rates of systematic processing of the flu message. However, systematic processing did not mediate the relationship between worry about the flu and intention <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> flu <b>shot.</b> The results support the role of emotion in health behavior decisions and introduce an effective experimental technique for inducing worry about a health condition...|$|R

500|$|In June, U-5 helped {{search for}} the lost Austro-Hungarian {{seaplane}} L 41, and in July, received an upgrade of her deck gun to a [...] QF gun. In early August, U-5 was sent out from Lissa when the Austro-Hungarian Navy received word from a reconnaissance aircraft that an Italian submarine had been sighted at Pelagosa. On the morning of 5 August, the Italian submarine Nereide was on the surface, moored under a cliff in the island's harbor. When U-5 surfaced just offshore, Nereides commanding officer, Capitano di Corvetta Carlo del Greco, cast off the lines and maneuvered <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at von Trapp's boat. Nereide launched a single torpedo at U-5 that missed, after which del Greco ordered his boat submerged. U-5 lined up a shot and launched a single torpedo at the slowly submerging target, striking her, and sending her to the bottom with all hands. The Italian captain received the Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Militare for his actions. At the end of August, U-5 captured the [...] Greek steamer Cefalonia as a prize off Durazzo. In late November, Friedrich Schlosser succeeded von Trapp as U-5s commanding officer.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Johnson's fifth season, West—who {{had become}} the Lakers general manager—traded Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling responsibilities. Johnson that season {{averaged}} a double-double of 17.6points and 13.1assists, as well as 7.3rebounds per game. The Lakers reached the Finals {{for the third year}} in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics {{met for the first time}} in the post-season. The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18seconds to go, but after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime. In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21assists in a 137–104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series. Friends Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street. During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0points on [...]560shooting, 13.6assists, and 7.7rebounds per game. Johnson later described the series as [...] "the one championship we should have had but didn't get".|$|E

2500|$|On 26 December 1943, Albacore {{departed}} Australia for {{the first}} time under Blanchard's command in order to patrol north of the Bismarck Islands. Directed by Ultra signal intelligence to intercept a Japanese I-boat, Albacore made no contact when the I-boat failed to arrive. Blanchard spotted his first target on 12January 1944 and sank the ammunition ship Choko Maru (about 2,750tons) with two separate torpedo attacks. Two days later, he worked in concert with Wally Ebert in Scamp and [...] "Bub" [...] Ward in Guardfish. Ward, unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> flushed the destroyer Sazanami (1,750tons); Blanchard sank her with a spread of four shots from his stern torpedo tubes, while Ward stood by taking periscope pictures. Another destroyer pinned him down and delivered fifty-nine depth charges, leaving Ebert and Ward free to pursue three tankers. Following more than a fortnight of uneventful patrolling, Albacore headed home, with fuel stops at Tulagi and Midway Island before reaching Pearl Harbor on 22February. After three days of repairs, Albacore went on to Mare Island for overhaul.|$|E

Reportedly, the two coyotes would travel ahead at the flanks of the wolf and warn him of any danger ahead. Williams realized this and decided to shoot and kill both coyotes in hopes of being able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>shot,</b> and the deaths of the coyotes did indeed spook the wolf.|$|R

Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground.

[...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts it for a second when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else."

Joe made his return on the April 19 edition of Impact! appearing as a surprise member of Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Terry) in an eight-man tag team match against Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm), in which he scored the deciding pinfall by pinning Roode after a Muscle Buster. Joe then left the Impact Zone and did not celebrate with his fellow team members. His abduction never was explained. According to Joe, Vince Russo planned a big storyline with a psycho gimmick. However, Russo called him to return because he need more babyfaces and Russo never find the way to explain the abduction. The following week Joe inexplicably assaulted the X Division Champion Kazarian, after his title match with Shannon Moore. In the following weeks Joe went on to randomly attack wrestlers like Douglas Williams, Brian Kendrick and Matt Morgan, the last of whom lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship thanks to the attack.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong.
