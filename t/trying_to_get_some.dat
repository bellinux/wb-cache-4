Unlike the old SDB, the SDAP was more like its German counterpart, then still also named the SDAP, which was taking a more reformist course, trying to get social law implemented, while still keeping the ideal of {{revolution}} up.|$|E
500|$|The {{children}} {{then set}} up a radio show called [...] "We Know All Your Secrets", in which they expose {{the secrets of the}} adults of Springfield like the kids in the movie. The children are tracked down at the billboard by Professor Frink's machine, and an argument between the children and the adults ensues. Unfortunately, the argument rouses the ire of Grampa and the other senior citizens <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep, and they vow to teach both groups a lesson. Their revenge turns out to be enforcing a curfew banning everyone under the age of seventy from the streets after dark, which is a measure that passed by a single vote, due to Homer refusing to cast a ballot.|$|E
500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E

In particular, he noted that at the Battle of South Mountain he was able to keep Garland's brigade fighting for two more hours after Samuel Garland death. At Antietam, he admitted that, [...] "the unaccountable panic occurred, when I was left along on the field, with only Capatin Withers of Caswell and perhaps one other officer, and I had just gotten off, when I encountered ... General Lee, and it was while, with him I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> men out of the Hay Stacks that a piece of shell struck me in the forehead." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till {{last week when he}} made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorateâ€”but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

Mr. Dodge and the other men of the concern were very much worried, but could do nothing further. The county {{authorities}} appeared to be helpless, although the sheriff and two deputies spent two days in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> trace of the criminal.

"Of {{course it}} can't be proved yet, but there's {{no doubt in}} my mind that Lee, who is an old friend of Ned Falkner's, got up that job to help him, and that Ned's off with the money by this time--and I'm right glad of it. I can't say ez we've done much towards it, except to keep {{tumbling}} in the way of that detective party of Stanner's, and so throw them off the trail--ha, ha! The Judge here, I reckon, has had his share of fun, for while he was at Hennicker's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> facts from Hennicker's pretty daughter, Stanner tried to get up some sort of vigilance committee of the stage passengers to burn down Hennicker's ranch out of spite, but the Judge here stepped in and stopped that." ...|$|E

He'll talk to you about Boston. He's much fonder of Boston than you are, even."

60|$|Well, Dolly, I {{suppose you}} will {{think it was}} pretty hard for those people, and when I got over my temper I confess that I felt sorry for the two men, and for the young girl whom the Altrurians would not call Lady Moors, but {{addressed}} by her Christian name, as they did each of the American party {{in his or her}} turn; even Mrs. Thrall had to answer to Rebecca. They were all rather bewildered, and so were the butler and the footmen, and the chef and his helpers, and the ladies' maids. These were even more shocked than those they considered their betters, and I quite took to my affections Lord Moors' man Robert, who was in an awe-stricken way <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> light from me on the situation. He contributed as much as any one to bring about a peaceful submission to the inevitable, for he had been a near witness of {{what had happened to the}} crew when they attempted their rebellion to the authorities; but he did not profess to understand the matter, and from time to time he seemed to question the reality of it.|$|E

60|$|When all was ready, {{the gentleman}} desired his servant {{to take the}} cushion {{and put it into}} the sledge {{designed}} for himself and the Lady of Kottenner. The man took it on his shoulders, hiding it under an old ox- hide, with the tail hanging down, to the laughter of all beholders. Helen further records the <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> breakfast in the marketplace and finding nothing but herrings, also the going to mass, and the care she took not to sit upon the holy crown, though she had to sit on its cushion in the sledge. They dined at an inn, but took care to keep the cushion in sight, and then in the dusk crossed the Danube on the ice, which was becoming very thin, and halfway across it broke under the maidens' carriage, so that Helen expected to be lost in the Danube, crown and all. However, though many packages were lost under the ice, her sledge got safe over, as well as all the ladies, some of whom she took into her conveyance, and all safely arrived at the castle of Komorn late in the evening.|$|E
60|$|Then {{besides the}} young French buck, whom we will willingly suppose harmless, you see {{specimens}} of the French raff, who goes aux eaux: gambler, speculator, sentimentalist, duellist, travelling with madame his wife, at whom other raffs nod and wink familiarly. This rogue {{is much more}} picturesque and civilized than the similar person in our own country: whose manners betray the stable; who never reads anything but Bell's Life; and who is much more at ease in conversing with a groom than with his employer. Here come Mr. Boucher and Mr. Fowler: better to gamble for a score of nights with honest Monsieur Lenoir, than to sit down in private once with those gentlemen. But we have said that their profession is going down, {{and the number of}} Greeks daily diminishes. They are travelling with Mr. Bloundell, who was a gentleman once, and still retains about him some faint odor of that time of bloom; and Bloundell has put himself on young Lord Talboys, and is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> money out of that young nobleman. But the English youth of the present day is a wide-awake youth, and male or female artifices are expended pretty much in vain on our young travelling companion.|$|E
6000|$|Our pious Fathers, {{feeling well}} what {{importance}} {{lay in the}} speaking of man to men, founded churches, made endowments, regulations; everywhere in the civilized world there is a Pulpit, environed with all manner of complex dignified appurtenances and furtherances, that therefrom a man with the tongue may, to best advantage, address his fellow-men. They {{felt that this was}} the most important thing; that without this there was no good thing. It is a right pious work, that of theirs; beautiful to behold! But now with the art of Writing, with the art of Printing, a total change has come over that business. The Writer of a Book, is not he a Preacher preaching not to this parish or that, on this day or that, but to all men in all times and places? Surely it is of the last importance that he do his work right, whoever do it wrong;--that the eye report not falsely, for then all the other members are astray! Well; how he may do his work, whether he do it right or wrong, or do it at all, is a point which no man in the world has taken the pains to think of. To a certain shopkeeper, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> money for his books, if lucky, he is of some importance; to no other man of any. Whence he came, whither he is bound, by what ways he arrived, by what he might be furthered on his course, no one asks. He is an accident in society.
