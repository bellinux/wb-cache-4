40|$|Weight-related <b>teasing</b> {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and weight control behaviors in adolescents. While research has typically examined weight-related <b>teasing</b> directed towards the individual, little is known about weight-related <b>teasing</b> at the school level. This study aimed to determine the association between the school-level prevalence of weight-related <b>teasing</b> and psychosocial factors, body dissatisfaction and weight control behaviors in adolescents. Adolescents (N = 2, 793; 53. 2 % female) attending 20 US public middle and high schools were surveyed as part of the Eating and Activity in Teens (EAT) 2010 study. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the association between school-level weight-related <b>teasing</b> and health variables, controlling for individual-level weight-related <b>teasing,</b> clustering of individuals within schools, and relevant covariates. A greater school-level prevalence of weight-related <b>teasing</b> was associated with lower self-esteem and greater body fat dissatisfaction in girls, and greater depressive symptoms in boys, over and above individual-level weight-related <b>teasing.</b> Dieting was associated with the school-level prevalence of weight-related <b>teasing</b> in analysis adjusted for covariates in girls, but not following adjustment for individual-level weight-related <b>teasing.</b> Unhealthy weight control behaviors, extreme weight control behaviors, and muscle-enhancing behaviors were not associated with the school-level prevalence of weight-related <b>teasing</b> in girls or boys. Findings from the current study, in conjunction with previous findings showing associations between weight-related <b>teasing,</b> psychological concerns, and weight control behaviors, highlight the importance of implementing strategies to decrease weight-related <b>teasing</b> in schools...|$|R

40|$|<b>Teasing</b> is {{prevalent}} {{throughout the}} lives of most individuals beginning in childhood. <b>Teasing</b> can be a positive "pro-social" interaction, or a negative "anti-social" experience. Childhood <b>teasing</b> on the "anti-social" level has been show to have detrimental effects on an individual's self-esteem and {{has been linked to}} increased psychological distress in adulthood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of an individual's environment, as defined by his or her <b>teasing</b> history with their peers and families, at different stages during their development on their level of self-esteem. Two hundred and three adult participants completed a questionnaire packet designed to measure <b>teasing</b> history, self-esteem, and perceived social support from family and peers. Results indicated that negative <b>teasing</b> interactions were related to lower reported levels of self-esteem. Negative <b>teasing</b> from one's family during elementary school and negative <b>teasing</b> from one's peers during middle school were found to have the greatest influence on current self-esteem levels. Results also showed that early and concurrent exposure to <b>teasing</b> at the pro-social level during elementary school could negate the later influence future anti-social <b>teasing</b> might have on one's self esteem levels.

50|$|Whether <b>teasing</b> is playful or hurtful or educative {{is largely}} {{subject to the}} {{interpretation}} of the person being <b>teased.</b> If the person being <b>teased</b> feels harmed, then the <b>teasing</b> is hurtful. A difference in power between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful. Ultimately though, if someone perceives him or herself as the victim of <b>teasing,</b> and experiences the <b>teasing</b> as unpleasant, then it is considered hurtful. If parents' intentions are positive, as in many Indigenous American Communities, then <b>teasing</b> to the community can be seen as an educational tool. The child may or may not understand that in the moment. If the other person continues to do it after being asked to stop then it is a form of bullying or abuse.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes.

The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a <b>tease</b> for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to <b>tease</b> out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the specific impact of remembered childhood and adolescent <b>teasing</b> on different dimensions of body image in young adults.

The results revealed that the frequency of being <b>teased</b> about one’s appearance was the only significant predictor of appearance satisfaction in women. Overweight preoccupation was not predicted by weight or appearance <b>teasing.</b> For men, the perceived distress of appearance and weight-related <b>teasing</b> predicted appearance satisfaction and overweight preoccupation respectively. The results suggest that different types of <b>teasing</b> can have differential impacts on the body image of young men and women.

40|$|Children with {{pediatric}} obesity face a {{broad range}} of medical and psychosocial impacts. While the research has focused primarily on medical effects, some psychosocial effects have been identified, including depression, poor self-esteem, anxiety, and behavioral issues. Significant racial and socioeconomic discrepancies in rates of obesity appear by early childhood. Children who are obese are subjected to a significantly higher level of physical-appearance related <b>teasing,</b> by peers, family members, and others. The research is limited on what the effects of this <b>teasing</b> may be, although preliminary research suggests it has long-lasting negative impacts. This mixed-methods study examined the physical appearance-related <b>teasing</b> experiences of children with pediatric obesity, and how these experiences correlate with body esteem and physical self-efficacy. Data from 56 {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 13 (M = 11. 11) completed a qualitative questionnaire about their <b>teasing</b> experiences; of those, 31 also completed quantitative questionnaires. Although no statistical analyses were significant, children who reported more physical appearance-related <b>teasing</b> experiences also tended to report lower body esteem and lower physical self-efficacy. On qualitative questionnaire, children who were <b>teased</b> about their physical appearance endorsed a range of negative feelings about their <b>teasing,</b> including sadness, embarrassment, and anger. Some children demonstrated resilience amidst <b>teasing.</b> Of note, the majority of children who reported being <b>teased</b> stated that they did not do anything in response to <b>teasing,</b> or they ignored the <b>teasing.</b> Implications of these results are discussed, as well as clinical, intervention, and further research recommendations...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, {{we focus}} on <b>teasing</b> as a {{prominent}} expression of layered communication. Depending on the situational and contextual grounding of an interaction, <b>teasing</b> serves different communicative functions. It does make a difference, for instance, whether <b>teasing</b> takes place among long-time friends, relatives or among economic competitors, colleagues or even political enemies. Similarly, {{it makes a difference}} whether a <b>teasing</b> sequence occurs in the private setting of a household, in parliament, in a TV studio or as part of a screen play. In the present study, we restrict our empirical focus to the occurrence of <b>teasing</b> sequences in four prominent American sitcoms of the nineties: The Nanny, Friends, Married with Children and Spin City. In this corpus, we observe how <b>teasing</b> {{can be used as a}} more or less subtle instrument to express certain feelings towards each other. A rich theatre producer <b>teases</b> his nanny to reveal his strong romantic feelings for her, and the aforementioned shoe salesman <b>teases</b> his wife to reveal precisely the opposite. <b>Teasing</b> can thus be seen as an ideal means to “test the water”, as Martin (2007) aptly remarks. It is therefore unmistakably part and parcel of human nature. The general aim of this contribution is to gain a better insight in the socio-semantic characteristics of <b>teasing</b> as a multi-layered and multi-perspectival phenomenon. On the basis of corpus data, more specifically, we envisage an accurate empirical analysis of <b>teasing</b> as it is construed in the dialogue sequences of four famous American sitcoms. Through the identification of five parameters in the analysis of 402 <b>teasing</b> instances, we are able to derive an annotation grid for an integrated and adequate analysis of <b>teasing</b> as a multifaceted phenomenon. Beyond the scope of this paper, we expect this annotation grid to be a valuable starting point for a similar analysis of <b>teasing</b> as it occurs in spontaneous everyday interactions. status: publishe...|$|R
