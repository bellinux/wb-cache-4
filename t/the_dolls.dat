5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} {{wardrobe}} contains the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with <b>the</b> <b>dolls.</b> Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of a book salesman and homemaker, O'Neill was raised in rural Nebraska. She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City at age fifteen. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, were later manufactured as bisque dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and celluloid versions. <b>The</b> <b>dolls</b> were wildly popular {{in the early twentieth}} century, and are considered {{to be one of the}} first mass-marketed toys in the United States.|$|E

At recess, Sarah displays her doll to many other admiring children. One of the older boys, Joe West, comes over, asking to hold <b>the</b> <b>doll.</b> Sarah is initially reluctant to let him hold <b>the</b> <b>doll</b> but she ultimately relents.

On the way home, Sarah passes the Westsâ€™ fields and sees Joe teasing a calf. She calls out to Joe but he ignores her, heading towards the house. Sarah then sits by the roadside and cries as a remorseful Joe watches her through the window from his house.

5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking <b>the</b> <b>dolls</b> back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. <b>The</b> <b>dolls</b> were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dollsâ€”toy dolls with blank faces that could be individually decorated by childrenâ€”which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had left over from the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E
5|$|The West Cornwall covered {{bridge is}} very {{significant}} and important {{as one of}} only three surviving covered bridges in the state of Connecticut. The bridge's modification from the original Town lattice represents a unique design that is not repeated in either the Comstock's Bridge or Bull's Bridge. The covered bridge is perhaps best known for being featured on postcards of New England villages. Terry Miller and Ronald Knapp assert that Charles Ives passed by the bridge {{on the way to the}} Berkshires which inspired the third movement in the Three Places in New England. The bridge appeared in the opening scenes of the movie, Valley of <b>the</b> <b>Dolls</b> a 1967 American drama film based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Jacqueline Susann. This brief scene occurs near the 2 minute mark of the film, during the opening credits. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E
