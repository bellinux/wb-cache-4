5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists {{of interest and}} possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium was available in Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing the size of <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> tailings.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} meeting John in the NEMS office, Alf (who was then 56 years old) {{turned up at}} Kenwood again, with his fiancée Pauline Jones. Pauline had been an 18-year-old Exeter University student and a Rolling Stones fan when she met the 54-year-old Alf in 1966. Alf and Pauline grew tired of trying to {{convince}} Pauline's mother {{to allow them to}} marry, so they eloped and were married in Gretna Green, Scotland. In 1966, Alf asked John if he could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help, looking after Julian Lennon and also <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> fan mail. Pauline spent a few months living at Kenwood in the attic bedroom. Alf and Pauline moved to a flat in Bourne Court, London Road, Patcham (a suburb of Brighton) before moving to Ladies Mile Road, Brighton, in November 1969. Alf had two sons with Pauline: David Henry Lennon (February 26, 1969) and Robin Francis Lennon (October 22, 1973).|$|E

25|$|Because {{at least}} two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out of the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> people who fell over each other.|$|E
25|$|In pre-contact Tonga, {{women did}} not do the cooking (cooking in an earth oven was hard, hot work, the {{province}} of men) or work in the fields. They raised children, gathered shellfish on the reef, and made koloa, barkcloth and mats, which were a traditional form of wealth exchanged at marriages and other ceremonial occasions. An industrious woman thus raised the social status of her household. Her family also slept soundly, on <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> mats and barkcloth that were the traditional bedding. On sunny days, these were spread on the grass to air, which prolonged their life.|$|E

In the 18th century, rocks and heavy materials were used to fortify the shore of the Cooper River on the eastern side of the peninsula. In 1838, this area along the seawall became a promenade. First used as a public park in 1837, the area now known as White Point Garden became a place for artillery during the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of {{contributors to the}} Mishnah state that the table was of the same dimensions as the loaves - 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was a gap between <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> shewbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions clearly are {{too small for the}} loaves to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that the loaves were free standing on the table.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{diamonds}} are safely irradiated in four ways: proton and deuteron bombardment via cyclotrons; {{gamma ray}} bombardment via exposure to cobalt-60; neutron bombardment via <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment via Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms {{out of place}} and producing color centers. Irradiated diamonds are all some shade of green, black, or blue after treatment, but most are annealed to further modify their color into bright shades of yellow, orange, brown, or pink. The annealing process increases the mobility of individual carbon atoms, allowing some of the lattice defects created during irradiation to be corrected. The final color {{is dependent on the}} diamond's composition and the temperature and length of annealing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lower}} and middle {{parts of the}} slopes old and non-fertilised meadows with fruit trees offer a blaze of colour of {{different}} flowers. With their high trunks the fruit groves provide the optimal habitat for a diversity of small animals, birds, and plants. The wryneck {{is one of the}} typical inhabitants of these meadows, because they avoid bleak areas and dense forests. Just as important for the small animals, birds, and plants are the various hedges and shrubs, which can be found everywhere on and around Hesselberg. In our farmed landscape hedges have the largest variety of microhabitats. In addition to the groves there is a herb layer—rich in species—a sunny herb fringe, coarse woody debris, and possibly special biotopes, such as <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> stones. Because of the transition from water-permeable to impermeable rock layers several spring horizons have emerged, explaining the richness of the springs. On Hesselberg there are several deep wells, but most springs appear in the form of flat swamps. The special flora and fauna of the wells is not immediately obvious, because most of the organisms are microscopic. Sundew is a very rare plant found in these wetlands.|$|E

25|$|After Stalin's {{death in}} 1953, {{many cases of}} the Soviet {{political}} prisoners were re-examined by the Soviet authorities during the de-Stalinization campaign and Poška was {{allowed to return to}} Lithuania in 1959. After his return home Poška worked as a lecturer, a correspondent of several newspapers, {{and the chairman of the}} reestablished Vilnius Esperantist Club in 1964–69. As a former political prisoner, he remained suspect to Soviet authorities and was not allowed to continue academic activities or publish his books until the Perestroika reforms in 1985. Poška continued to travel. For example, in 1960, together with biologist Tadas Ivanauskas, he visited the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve in Tajikistan and later hitchhiked to Leningrad and Moldova. In summer 1972, at age 70, he went on the last large journey. It was a five-week motorbike ride to the Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, via the Georgian Military Road to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Sukhumi on the Black sea. The last decade of his life Poška spent under <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> his rescued archive, trying and failing to publish it. His major work, the eight-volume book on his journey to India From the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Bengal, was published by his supporters already after his death.|$|E
25|$|At first all firing was {{at close}} range; half the Indian men {{were killed or}} wounded before {{they had a chance}} to get off any shots. Some of the Indians grabbed rifles from <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> confiscated weapons and opened fire on the {{soldiers}}. With no cover, and with many of the Indians unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Indian warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Indian women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Indians (men, women, and children), in some cases for miles across the prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Historian Dee Brown, in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, mentions an estimate of 300 of the original 350 having been killed or wounded and that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Army casualties numbered 25 dead and 39 wounded.|$|E
500|$|Throne of Blood, a Japanese version {{filmed in}} 1958 by Akira Kurosawa, replaces the Three Witches with the Forest Spirit, an old hag who sits at her {{spinning}} wheel, symbolically entrapping Macbeth's equivalent, Washizu, {{in the web}} of his own ambition.

Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E
