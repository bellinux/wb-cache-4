30|$|The total {{activity}} in each sphere {{was calculated for}} each of the nine 90 Y-based acquisitions and was compared to the theoretical value as a percentage of recovered activity. The {{total activity}} in a sphere was computed as the mean intensity of all voxels within the volume of interest (VOI) corresponding to the sphere. The VOI for each sphere was determined from the sum image of the 30 18 [*]F-based independent acquisitions mentioned earlier for PVE determination. The five VOIs were calculated using a threshold relative to the maximum value in the VOI. The intensity threshold was chosen to obtain the smallest difference between the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> and the <b>measured</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective. As bladder {{distension}} {{related to}} anaesthesia puts patients {{at risk for}} permanent dysfunction, perioperative determination of bladder volume is of great importance. The {{aim of this study}} is to validate an ultrasonic imaging device for determing bladder urine volume. Method. To evaluate a broad volume range, ultrasonically scanned volumes were compared to <b>true</b> urinary <b>volumes</b> both in surgical patients and in volunteers. After institutional approval and informed consent 60 healthy volunteers were asked not to void for as long as possible. After ultrasound measurements (BladderScan BVI 2500, Diagnostic Ultrasound, Redmond WA, U. S. A.) they voided and <b>true</b> urinary <b>volumes</b> were <b>measured.</b> Fifty surgical patients scheduled for procedures requiring urinary catheterisation were studied. Pre- and post-induction of anaesthesia ultrasound measurements were recorded, followed by urinary catheterisation and measurement of <b>true</b> urinary <b>volume.</b> Urine volumes were compared using Student t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank Tests (p < 0. 05). For validation linear regression was used together with Bland-Altman analyses. Results. Ultrasonic scanning underestimated the <b>true</b> urine <b>volume</b> by about 7 % over the whole volume range (17 ml to 970 ml). Underestimation was larger in females than in males (p < 0. 02). R- 2 values for correlation of measured and scanned urinary volumes ranged between 0. 92 and 0. 95. Bland and Altman analyses showed a bias of 31 ml in volunteers and of 19 ml in patients and a precision of 110 ml and 80 ml, respectively. Conclusions. The ultrasonic imaging device can be used peri-operatively to establish bladder volume, taking into account the 7 % underestimation of the bladder volume...|$|R
40|$|Background Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEUS) {{has recently}} been proposed as a minimally- invasive, alternative method for blood volume measurement. This study aims at comparing the accuracy of CEUS and the classical thermodilution techniques for volume assessment in an in-vitro set-up. Methods The in-vitro set-up consisted of a variable network between an inflow and outflow tube and a roller pump. The inflow and outflow tubes were insonified with an ultrasound array transducer and a thermistor was placed in each tube. Indicator dilution curves were made by injecting indicator which consisted of an ultrasound-contrast-agent diluted in ice-cold saline. Both acoustic intensity- and thermo-dilution curves were {{used to calculate the}} indicator mean transit time between the inflow and outflow tube. The volumes were derived by multiplying the estimated mean transit time by the flow rate. We compared the <b>volumes</b> <b>measured</b> by CEUS with the <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> of the variable network and those measured by thermodilution by Bland-Altman and intraclass-correlation analysis. Results The measurements by CEUS and thermodilution showed a very strong correlation (rs = 0. 94) with a modest volume underestimation by CEUS of - 40 ± 28 mL and an overestimation of 84 ± 62 mL by thermodilution compared with the <b>true</b> <b>volumes.</b> Both CEUS and thermodilution showed a high statistically significant correlation with the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> (rs = 0. 97 (95 % CI, 0. 95 - 0. 98;...|$|R

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is {{the weight of the}} package at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of the package. The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of the package.

40|$|Regression {{equations}} {{were developed}} from left ventricular casts of known volumes to calculate left ventricular volumes from biplane cineangiography obtained in non-standard views. Volumes were calculated by Simpson's rule from casts of postmortem specimens from patients with congenital heart disease. The casts {{were divided into}} two groups: those that came from patients with abnormal right ventricular haemodynamic function (group 1, n = 11) and those that came from patients in which it was normal (group 2, n = 9). Biplane cinegrams were taken in conventional (anteroposterior/lateral, right anterior oblique/left anterior oblique) and non-conventional (long axis oblique, hepatoclavicular, and sitting up) projections. The <b>true</b> <b>volume</b> of each cast was determined from its weight and specific gravity. Correlations between <b>measured</b> and <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> (r = 0. 96 to 0. 99) were excellent in all projections, although each projection overestimated the <b>true</b> <b>volumes</b> (slope = 0. 72 to 0. 94).

40|$|The {{success of}} {{catheter}} ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is {{highly dependent on}} a preprocedural assessment of {{the size and shape}} of the left atrium. The most precise method to determine left atrial (LA) volume using computed tomography requires manually tracing the LA area of each cross-sectional image. This is a labor-intensive and time-consuming technique. The purpose of this study was to compare LA volume derived using the "gold-standard" multiple-slice technique with LA volume estimated using 3 orthogonal LA dimensions in patients with AF. The patient population was composed of 100 patients referred for catheter ablation of AF (87 men, mean age 57 +/- 12 years). AF was paroxysmal in 49 patients and persistent in 51. Each patient underwent computed tomography before catheter ablation, and LA <b>volume</b> was <b>measured</b> using the 2 methods. The mean LA <b>volume</b> <b>measured</b> using the multiple-slice technique was 1. 36 +/- 46 ml. According to the simpler estimation approach, the mean LA volume was 112 +/- 41 ml. A close correlation was noted between atrial volumes determined using the 2 methods (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 001). There was a mean underestimation of LA volume by the estimation technique of 17 +/- 13 %. In conclusion, the results of this study reveal that LA volume determined using an estimation approach correlates closely with <b>true</b> LA <b>volume</b> as determined using the gold-standard multiple-slice approach. This estimation approach underestimates <b>true</b> LA <b>volume</b> by approximately 20 %. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2008; 102 : 1567 - 1570...|$|R
