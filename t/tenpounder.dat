50|$|Elops hawaiensis, the Hawaiian ladyfish, Hawaiian <b>tenpounder,</b> or banana fish, is {{a species}} of fish in the Elopidae family. It is {{sometimes}} referred to as the giant herring, and its Hawaiian name is awa 'aua. It is native to the west central Pacific Ocean, and the current classification may in fact consist of several species.|$|E
5000|$|This species uses a {{wide range}} of water salinities when spawning. Under normal conditions, the Pacific <b>tenpounder</b> are located in {{brackish}} water, but they travel deep into oceanic, salty waters for breeding. They place their eggs far from shore in more planktonic regions to provide them with nutrients as juveniles. [...] The larvae look like eels at birth, but their forked tails distinguish them. Their young usually feed on the crustaceans in the brackish or coastal waters. This may explain their instinct to move from the Gulf of California into the Lower Colorado during flood conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The Elopiformes [...] are {{the order}} of ray-finned fish {{including}} the tarpons, <b>tenpounders,</b> and ladyfish, {{as well as a}} number of extinct types. They have a long fossil record, easily distinguished from other fishes by the presence of an additional set of bones in the throat.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} {{restricted}} {{primarily to the}} Southwest United States. [...] Most records come from the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California, as they spawn here and then travel southwest into Arizona. They were also common in the Salton Sea in California, but their numbers have been slowly declining. During floods, Pacific ladyfish enter the Lower Colorado River from the Gulf. They {{can be found in}} Yuma Colorado River portions, with records as far south as certain Mexican dams. Pacific <b>tenpounders</b> are primarily a marine form, meaning they require a higher salinity water content then most freshwater fish. Because of this, they have evolved efficient swimming techniques allowing them to swim in lagoons and estuaries with higher salinities. Their maximum depth is around 10 m.|$|R
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including <b>tenpounders,</b> sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For many genes, ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) {{have two}} paralogous copies, where only one {{ortholog}} {{is present in}} tetrapods. The discovery of an additional, almost-complete set of Hox clusters in teleosts (zebrafish, pufferfish, medaka, and cichlid) but not in basal actinopterygian lineages (Polypterus) led to the formulation of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. The phylogenetic timing of this genome duplication during the evolution of rayfinned fish is unknown, since only a few species of basal fish lineages have been investigated so far. In this study, three nuclear genes (fzd 8, sox 11, tyrosinase) were sequenced from sturgeons (Acipenseriformes), gars (Semionotiformes), bony tongues (Osteoglossomorpha), and a <b>tenpounder</b> (Elopomorpha). For these three genes, two copies have been described previously teleosts (e. g., zebrafish, pufferfish), but only one orthologous copy is found in tetrapods. Individual gene trees for these three genes and a concatenated dataset {{support the hypothesis that}} the fish-specific genome duplication event took place after the split of the Acipenseriformes and the Semionotiformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes. If these three genes were duplicated during the proposed fish-specific genome duplication event, then Present addresses: *De ´ partement de biochimie, Universite ´ de Montreal, Montreal...|$|E
40|$|TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: There is {{a single}} genus in the family Elopidae (tenpounders), {{composed}} of about 5 species (Nelson 1974). Whitehead (1962) presents a key to six species he recognized at the time. Others have speculated that only a single species exists. Forey (1973) presents {{a detailed account of}} the extant species. The Pacific <b>tenpounder</b> or machete is primarily a marine form that moves into brackish or fresh water. DESCRIPTION: The family is typified as having rounded bodies, terminal mouths, large pseudobranchiae, branchiostegal rays 27 - 35, dorsal fin rays usually 20 - 25 (last ray not elongate), anal fin rays usually 13 - 19, pelvic rays usually 12 - 16, conus arteriosus absent, lateral line tubes unbranched, lateral line scales usually 95 - 120, pelvic fins inserted beneath or posterior to the origin of the dorsal fin, and vertebrae 63 - 79. "Body elongated, covered with small, silvery, cycloid, caducous scales. Dorsal and anal fins depressible into a sheath of scales along bases. Auxiliary and inguinal processes pronounced. Dorsal fin with 20 rays. Anal fin-rays 13. Pseudobranchiae large and exposed. Lateral line straight. Gular plate elongated, 3 or 4 times as long as broad. Color silvery over-all, with some yellowish pigment in eyes and at bases of paired fins " (Minckley 1973). Machete ma...|$|E
40|$|The Elopiformes {{represent}} {{a group of}} seven known species of fishes found in marine and estuarine ecosystem {{and many of them}} are endemic to East Asia. To date published morphological and molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of <b>Tenpounder</b> fishes are part congruent and there are some areas of significant disagreement with respect to species relationships. The present study analyzed the sequence data from four genes (Cytb, CO 1, 16 S and 12 S rRNA) of mitochondrial genome for the attempt to estimate the relationships among five species such as Elops saurus, E. affinis, E. smithi, E. machnata and E. hawaiensis and to assess the phylogenetic utility of these markers. The Kimura 2 - parameter (K 2 P) genetic distance, average nucleotide frequencies, nucleotide substitution patterns and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using neighbour joining (NJ) method. The interspecies K 2 P genetic distance was 0. 0158 and intraspecies distance was 0. 0042 based on the barcoding gene, CO 1 sequence data. Whereas the interspecies K 2 P genetic distance was 0. 6140 and intraspecies genetic distance was 0. 0020 based on the Cytb data. The four mitochondrial marker genes used in this study showed different type of cluster and we could not confirm the relationship between the five Elops species. This is due to the independent mutation rate of each mtDNA genes. However, this problem can be overcome by analysing in parallel other gene markers...|$|E
40|$|The set-net fishery of Taiwan was {{examined}} in this study in the context of ecological sustainable development of a unique fishery. Set-net fishery, unlike many other active forms of fishing, involves static gear set in near shore coastal environments and targets migratory pelagic fish. This study is the first comprehensive examination of a set-net fishery and draws on a comprehensive literature (published mainly in Taiwanese). Data are presented on annual production in the context of regional fishing cooperators which have been established to manage the set-net fishery. Information on fishing technology and the application of set-net gears in coastal waters is presented including net design and operation through extending questionnaire census responses. Detailed analyses of the catch from representative set-net fisheries present a comparative evaluation of species composition including interannual and seasonal variation. Sources of variation in the catch rates of set-nets are evaluated, particularly meteorological and environmental data (e. g. sea surface temperature). The {{results of the present study}} reveal that catches of giant trevally, yellowfin tuna, Hawaiian <b>tenpounder,</b> Japanese barracuda and sword fish are correlated with mean monthly water temperature. Only Spanish mackerel, which were associated with peak catches in winter, were negatively correlated with monthly mean temperature. Sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure are consistent with the hypothesis that ocean currents and their variation influence the catch rates of set-nets. Thus, pelagic fish including tuna, mackerel and trevally follow near-shore coastal currents making those fish vulnerable to capture by set-nets. Studies on the bathymetry and underwater topography near set-nets revealed an association with depth contours and catch rates of fish. Fish are more likely to be caught in set-nets if the set-nets are located near underwater troughs which in effect influence migration paths. Knowledge of underwater topography and associated ocean currents is important in locating set-nets and maximising catch rates of target species. By means of self-developed fishery detection data processing system (FDPS), an appropriate fishing site for set-net fishing can be selected. Acoustic surveys of fish near set-nets were used to examine fish behaviour near set-nets. The surveys revealed that most fish were active at night and were more likely to be caught over night than during the day. This is consistent with the daily variation in catches as set-nets are usually harvested twice a day (i. e., morning catch and afternoon catch). Whale sharks are occasionally caught in set-nets. Because of their conservation status, mitigation methods to avoid whale shark capture were evaluated. However, such mitigation is in tension with the economic benefits of catching and selling whale sharks (in high demand by premium seafood markets). Studies showed that most fish caught in set-nets were relatively small (30 - 40 cm total length). Mitigation methods (including wide-spaced rope grids to exclude large animals such as sharks) may negatively affect catch rates of target species (e. g. tuna). Thus, there are both economic and practical disincentives to apply whale shark- reducing devices. In all other respects, when compared with other fish methods (particularly demersal trawling), set-net fisheries have a demonstrably benign impact on coastal environments. Little by-catch is taken with almost all fish caught sold. What little by-catch is taken is used as food in co-located fish cage farming operations. As set-nets employ static gears, the quality of the fish caught is very high (compared with active trawl methods). This, and the regular harvest (twice daily) presents set-net fishery as a source of high value species with concomitant economic return to regional coastal communities. Thus, in the context of ecological sustainable development, the results of this study show demonstrable ecological, economic and social benefits from set-net fisheries in Taiwan...|$|E
