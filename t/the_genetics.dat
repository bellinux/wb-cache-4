5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} fears associated with <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> is <b>the</b> resurgence of eugenics, but too often this assumes <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> is eugenics without investigating the diverse definitions and interpretations of eugenics. The aim {{of this paper is}} to critically investigate the concept of eugenics in theory and in practice and to question whether <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> is a renewal, reform or return of eugenics. The discussion is oriented around six key arguments that illuminate the central points of convergence and divergence between the old eugenics and <b>the</b> new <b>genetics.</b> Ultimately, <b>the</b> paper concludes that despite significant procedural, legislative and administrative differences between the old eugenics and <b>the</b> new <b>genetics,</b> and despite significant spatial, temporal and cultural variations in interpretation and implementation, at the ideological level, there is essentially no difference. The old eugenics was <b>genetics</b> and <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> is eugenic...|$|R
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
5|$|Termites, {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. Termites are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E
5|$|The viable semen is then {{implanted}} in the ewe and the many lambs born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy. DNA tests have proved that up to 10% of the lambs are sired by the surrogate ram and carry <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of the donor ram.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding <b>the</b> <b>genetics,</b> cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman first studied <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of {{schizophrenia}} {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy {{and the evolution of}} the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to stimulate debate on the {{implications}} of <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> for health policy. Although there are different streams within the social science literature on <b>the</b> new <b>genetics,</b> <b>the</b> primary focus has been on the meaning of genetic testing from the perspective of the individual tested. While essential to understand, it does not add much to the health policy debate. A very different type of information has been produced by the public health and epidemiological literature, focused on screening for genetic disease and concerned with rates of detection, costs and benefits, and evaluation criteria. These data are very important to planning and implementing the type of prenatal screening program already in existence; they do not deal with issues central to <b>the</b> new <b>genetics,</b> such as commercialization, patenting and insurance. The problem is how best these topics should be researched. The final section of the paper suggests that given a phenomenon [...] <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> [...] which is both multifaceted and very complex, very new and yet with strong historical and cultural roots, we need a matching research agenda. One that breaks out of traditional paradigms separating one method from another and seeks information on <b>the</b> new <b>genetics</b> wherever it may be found.

5|$|Stebbins's Ph.D. {{was granted}} by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, {{with whom he}} had three children. In 1932, he took a {{teaching}} position in biology at Colgate University. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of Antennaria and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by Thomas Hunt Morgan and Barbara McClintock, who spoke about chromosomal crossover. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the cytogenetics of Paeonia, which established his reputation as a geneticist.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 study on <b>the</b> <b>genetics</b> of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested {{to consist of}} possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
