5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> script, an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
50|$|Anti-Khmer sentiment, Khmerophobia or {{sometimes}} refers as anti-Cambodian sentiment, is a sentiment against Cambodia, <b>the</b> <b>Khmers,</b> overseas Khmer, or <b>Khmer</b> culture. As <b>the</b> <b>Khmers</b> are dominant in Cambodia, {{it can be}} coined to anti-Cambodian sentiment and hatreds against Cambodians.|$|R

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge—which {{was in the process}} of seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge and China.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1975 <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge entered Phnom Penh {{bringing}} the Cambodian Civil War to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non {{and other top}} officials of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic Government were executed at the Cercle Sportif, while FANK troops in the city were disarmed, taken to the Olympic Stadium and executed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic, was surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic collapsed and <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{ethnic group}} in Cambodia are <b>the</b> <b>Khmers,</b> who {{comprise}} around 90% {{of the total}} population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. <b>The</b> <b>Khmers</b> historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, {{all the way to the}} mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern Vietnam.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> of Vietnam while <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> living in the remote Cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic fell to <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter {{the ashes of}} his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
25|$|In Peter Bourne's novel The Golden Pagans (c.1956), {{the main}} {{characters}} are sent to Arabia during the Crusades, captured, and forced into servitude by <b>the</b> <b>Khmers.</b> <b>The</b> prisoners build a portion of what becomes known as Angkor Thom.|$|R

50|$|By 1973 United States Department of State sources, {{possibly}} underestimating, {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>Khmers</b> rouges-dominated CPNLAF controlled about 60 percent of Cambodia's territory and 25 {{percent of the}} population. Despite a sustained United States bombing campaign that year to blunt the steady advance of the CPNLAF and to relieve pressure on FANK, <b>the</b> <b>Khmers</b> rouges insurgent forces were able to absorb their losses, to maintain the initiative, and to subject an increasingly demoralised and cornered FANK to unremitting pressure.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Navy had 171 vessels; <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Air Force had 211 aircraft, including 64 North American T-28s, 14 Douglas AC-47 gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel – who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program – sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.|$|E
5|$|By 17 February, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic {{abandoned}} {{attempts to}} reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh {{would have to come}} in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.|$|E

5|$|Despite ongoing {{threats from}} <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 {{percent of the}} vote, against 38.23 percent for the Cambodian People’s Party. Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen {{refused to accept the}} results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, {{announced}} the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the Cambodian People’s Party. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People’s Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister, and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister. On 23 September 1993, the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state. In July 1994, the Cambodian Government outlawed <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea. By 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge was completely dissolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Chakrapong {{established}} a royalist party, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Soul Party. When <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Soul Party {{failed to win}} a single parliamentary seat in the 2003 general elections, Charkapong rejoined Funcinpec and briefly served as Senator in 2005. In 2006, Chakrapong was expelled from Funcinpec and joined the Norodom Ranariddh Party. When the Cambodian government pursued legal investigations on the debts Chakrapong accumulated from his airlines, Chakrapong quit politics in 2007. Chakrapong, who was already a privy councillor to the Supreme Privy Council, then dedicated himself to humanitarian work and supporting royal activities. In 2013, Chakrapong was appointed member of the Constitutional Council of Cambodia by the King.|$|E
5|$|In March 1992, {{the start}} of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which {{included}} troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers. The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi. In June 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement. Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia. Towards the end of 1992, Khmer Rouge forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In {{the months leading up to}} the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.|$|E
