5|$|Although {{the flame}} fougasse was never used in Britain, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> {{exported}} to Greece {{by a couple}} of PWD officers when, in 1941, German invasion threatened. They were reported to have a powerful effect on enemy units.|$|E

5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war {{reasonably}} intact {{and was about}} 10% complete in 1945. She was judged obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, but <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E
30|$|A rule is {{that each}} and every paradigm-shift idea passes through four phases in its lifetime. In the phase # 1, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> radicalized (people laugh on it). In the phase # 2, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} (some people aggressively try to destroy it). In the phase # 3, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> accepted (most {{of those who were}} attacking it, now keep telling around that it <b>was</b> their <b>idea,</b> or at least that they always were supportive of that <b>idea).</b> In <b>the</b> final phase # 4, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> considered as something that existed forever (those who played roles in initial phases are already dead, physically or professionally, by the time the fourth phase started).|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> of rare event {{sampling}} {{is applied}} to the estimation of the performance of error-correcting codes. The essence of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> importance sampling of the pattern of noises in the channel by Multicanonical Monte Carlo, which enables efficient estimation of tails of the distribution of bit error rate. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> successfully tested with a convolutional code...|$|R

5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The show {{took five}} years to make. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> first {{suggested}} between the creator and director of Mongrels, Adam Miller, and the show's head puppeteer, Andy Heath, when they worked on ITV children's show Ripley and Scuff.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> not {{feasible}} at this stage, and the investor {{does not see}} any potential in the idea/product, the investor will not consider financing <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> However, if <b>the</b> idea/product is not directly feasible, but part of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> worthy of further investigation, the investor may invest some time and money in it for further investigation.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to highlight <b>the</b> main <b>idea</b> that <b>is</b> being presented. First the writer of the proposal should state what <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> and do something to make it unique. Next, the writer should explain {{what to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>Be</b> sure to avoid phrases such as: “No one has thought of doing this before” or “This is entirely original.” Doing so, will make the writer seem dull and inattentive.|$|R
5|$|A tram {{network has}} long been planned in Skopje and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> first {{proposed}} in the 1980s.

5|$|Alan Rickman voiced Absolem, the Caterpillar. Rickman was {{originally}} {{going to have}} his face composited onto the animated Caterpillar.

5|$|Everton {{constructed}} covered dugouts in 1931. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired by}} a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such dugouts had been constructed {{at the behest of}} the Dons' trainer Donald Colman.

5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes was {{to take advantage of the}} lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
