50|$|Travelers are {{operated}} by pulling {{down on the}} rope segments that ascend from the <b>tension</b> <b>pulley.</b> One rope segment is pulled to open the curtains {{and the other is}} pulled to close the curtains.|$|E
50|$|Directly below each {{carrier and}} above the chain is an eyelet through which the curtain {{operating}} line passes, if present. The operating line runs through two pulleys that are located near {{the tops of the}} curtains, one {{on each side of the}} stage (the dead end and live end pulleys), and then down to the stage floor, where it runs through a <b>tension</b> <b>pulley</b> before returning to the other pulleys in the fly space.|$|E
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the <b>tension</b> <b>pulley</b> (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|E
50|$|Pulleys {{are made}} up of several {{components}} including the shell, end disk, hub, shaft and locking assembly. The end disk and hub may be on piece. The locking assembly may also be replaced with a hub and bushing on lower <b>tension</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The shell is also referred to as the rim {{in some parts of the}} world.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{mechanics}} is {{the study}} of the motion of “material bodies”[3]. First-semester college physics (force, work, energy, momentum, torque, <b>tension,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> masses on springs, etc.) lays the groundwork for this, but the field is far richer, and physics majors take at least one more full semester of classes on this topic.

50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large <b>tensioning</b> <b>pulley</b> (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time in many {{material}} handling industries, need and capacity of conveying equipments are increasing rapidly. Conveyor pulleys have been recognized as a most necessary component of the conveyor system. As {{a result of these}} demand of conveyor pulley increasing day by day. Various types of pulleys are used for conveying systems. Here a focus is on the high <b>tension</b> <b>pulleys</b> where the use of custom made engineered welded steel pulley is dictated due to its higher capacity and ease of manufacturing. Requirement of various sizes conveyor pulleys are there as a result of various size of conveying systems are to be designed. It is now compulsory for the conveyor pulley manufacturer to increase the production rate. To be specific industries want a special purpose machine which in turn useful according to various diameter and various length of pulleys. Even they have to supply it on time with less cost to fulfill the customer needs. So an attempt is made to design special purpose equipments for Shell-Diaphragm Welding in Conveyor Pulley which is useful to increase the productivity and quality of the product...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>tension</b> causes <b>pulley</b> {{eccentric}} in belt drive. Through {{the analysis}} of the shaft deformation caused by the pulley eccentric, this paper resulted in the calculation method and related formulas for belt drive rotary motion error under different tension. And based on the PDJ- 4 belt drive experiment facility giving examples of analysis, we draw the conclusion that with the increase of tension, rotary motion error increases at the same time. Thus it will have a greater rotary motion error when the tension is too large. This paper proposed the scheme and measures to improve that error eventually...|$|R

Experiment shows that chain transmission in chain drive system leads to poor overall performance, due to its noise and chain gets loose due to aging and sprockets wear due to chain friction etc., the proposed system consists of drive and driven pulley with timing belt transmission. Compared to conventional method, proposed method give improved <b>tension</b> in <b>pulleys</b> and belt by the additional arrangement called belt tensioner.

The ratio was changed by {{expanding and contracting}} the drive pulley, with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt <b>tensioning</b> by jockey <b>pulley.</b>|$|R

A large diameter pulley (a Sinclair C5 wheel) is mounted on a trolley which is winched along a wire rope slung across the shaft and kept in <b>tension.</b> When the <b>pulley</b> is centred, the traverse rope is locked-off and the camera lowering rope can be released.|$|R
50|$|The springs {{used are}} large, stiff springs {{with a high}} modulus of elasticity, and they are highly <b>tensioned.</b> A {{compound}} <b>pulley</b> system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided {{by a factor of}} (say) five. The cable exiting the pulley system will have a moderate tension on it, but most importantly, when the cable is drawn in or out, and the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much. The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, <b>tension</b> cables, <b>pulleys,</b> counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automated Mechanical Transmission (AMT) {{is applied}} {{as a new}} {{starting}} device for belt conveyor in the paper. Simulation model of AMT driving belt conveyor is established in AMESim. Simulations of start-up process at first gear condition and shifting process from first to eighth gear are discussed. Belt velocity is accepted as the law of gearshifts to judge the moment of shifting. Simulation results show that AMT could achieve the purpose of belt conveyor’s soft-starting gradually. The belt appears short-time acceleration mutations during shifting process which results in the belt maximum <b>tension,</b> the driving <b>pulley</b> torque, and other parameters changing within their allowable limits. The belt maximum tension appears short-time mutations when the clutch is just engaged, {{in which case the}} peak value of belt maximum tension can achieve 110 KN approximately, and is less than its allowable limit. After shift actions, the belt maximum tension and other parameters curves tend to be stable...|$|R

40|$|Every {{university}} introductory physics course {{considers the}} problem of Atwood's machine {{taking into account the}} mass of the pulley. In the usual treatment the tensions at the two ends of the string are offhandedly taken to act on the pulley and be responsible for its rotation. However such a free-body diagram of the forces on the pulley is not a priori justified, inducing students to construct wrong hypotheses such as that the string transfers its <b>tension</b> to the <b>pulley</b> or that some symmetry is in operation. We reexamine this problem by integrating the contact forces between each element of the string and the pulley and show that although the pulley does behave as if the tensions were acting on it, this comes only as the end result of a detailed analysis. We also address the question of how much friction is needed to prevent the string from slipping over the pulley. Finally, we deal with the case in which the string {{is on the verge of}} sliding and show that this will never happen unless certain conditions are met by the coefficient of friction and the masses involved.

40|$|International audienceBelt drives {{employing}} a single, flat serpentine belt tensioned by a passive tensioner {{are found in}} automotive engine Front End Accessory Drive (FEAD) where the crankshaft supplies power to accessories like alternators, air-conditioning compressors, pumps, etc. [1]. When the FEAD undergoes forced vibration due to crankshaft excitation, dynamic tension fluctuations can cause the belt to slip on the accessory pulleys [2]. The probability of belt slip increases with the peak drop in belt <b>tension</b> over the <b>pulley</b> during steady state operation [3]. In this paper, one possible solution is analyzed, using a decoupler to isolate/separate the accessory inertia (e. g. alternator) from the FEAD system. This is achieved by placing between the pulley and the accessory {{a combination of a}} one-way rigid clutch and an isolator spring. In this study, the rotational response of a typical FEAD is extended to include the clutch and isolator. An analytical solution is then obtained by considering it as a piecewise-linearized system moving about an equilibrium angular displacements. The performance of the ordinary FEAD with regard to tension fluctuation is then compared to that of the system equipped with a decoupler/isolator. The results obtained indicate that within the practical working range of engine speeds, use of either an isolator or a decoupler-isolator could significantly lower the dynamic tension drop across the accessory pulley...|$|R
40|$|Summary:. Scalp defects {{greater than}} 2 [*]cm in {{diameter}} {{are not usually}} amenable to primary closure and require local tissue rearrangement, grafting, tissue expansion, or prolonged second intention healing. Scalp flap reconstruction is a significant undertaking that requires elevation of a total flap surface area that is 3 – 6 {{times the size of}} the defect, often involves profuse bleeding, and can be challenging to perform without conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Anticoagulated and medically complex patients pose additional challenges and limit options for treatment. The pulley suture uses the mechanical advantage of the <b>pulley</b> to distribute <b>tension</b> across a wound and is useful in areas of high tension such as scalp wounds. For scalp wounds greater than 2 [*]cm, pulley sutures are placed along the length of the wound. An assistant exerts equal <b>tension</b> on the <b>pulley</b> sutures, and the surgeon sequentially ties the sutures. The sutures are tightened and retied weekly until complete scalp closure is achieved. The pulley sutures can be used for rapid primary closure of scalp wounds up to 2. 5 – 3. 0 [*]cm in diameter under local anesthesia. For scalp wounds larger than 3 [*]cm, we have also found that pulley sutures can be progressively tightened yielding additional tissue expansion every week. Scalp wounds greater than 3. 0 [*]cm can be easily closed via primary repair and weekly tightening of pulley sutures without the need for flap reconstruction, traditional tissue expander placement, or second intention healing...|$|R
