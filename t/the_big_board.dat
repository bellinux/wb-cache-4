500|$|Whammy! [...] {{made use}} of {{technological}} advances that had been developed since the original Press Your Luck ended its run in the 1980s. For example, the prizes and light patterns for each space on <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> were randomly generated using a personal computer, running at a speed of 200MHz. This resulted in {{a very large number}} of patterns for gameplay, which prevented memorization of patterns as Michael Larson did on Press Your Luck. Also, Whammies were animated in 3D computer graphics, rather than being hand-drawn as on Press Your Luck.|$|E

But when the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11, 2001, it left an architectural void as new developments since the 1970s had played off the complex aesthetically.

2500|$|On May 26, 2011, WPVI debuted {{an hour-long}} 4 p.m. {{newscast}} to replace The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ended its 25-year syndication run one day prior; this edition was broadcast from a smaller news desk located {{next to the}} main anchor desk that only housed the anchors of that newscast and allowed the team to utilize <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> more frequently. This changed on June 26, 2017, when the entire news set was redone in a more modernized style and the smaller desk was removed, moving the anchors to the new main desk. The station also introduced [...] "Mobile 6", a news vehicle used for reports during the station's early evening newscasts. In the spring of 2012, the station expanded its weekend 11 p.m. newscasts to one hour. On September 8, 2014, the station's noon newscast also expanded to one full hour as a new daytime schedule was implemented.|$|E

50|$|Mobley {{rose from}} the ranks of a {{professor}} to department chair (1971-1974) to founding dean of the School of Business and Industry (SBI) from 1974 - 2003 (her fourth baby).

To support her innovative PD and academic curricula, Dean Mobley started <b>the</b> SBI <b>Big</b> <b>Board,</b> which consists of over 100 plaques. Each plaque on <b>the</b> SBI <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> represents a minimum donation of $100,000 endowed for scholarships.

As a result of her mega contributions to FAMU, Dr. Mobley received the designation of Dean Emerita upon her retirement.|$|R

60|$|Once {{across the}} swale {{he put his}} pony to a gallop and soon reached Uncle George's homestead. No one at home! The horse and wagon were gone. Pan left his package and turned back. As he trotted past the Blake gate Pan heard a faint call. It startled him. Reining in Curly he listened and looked. Blake's cabin stood back out of sight among the Cottonwoods. The barn, however, with its low open-sided shed, stood just inside the gate. The cows had been brought in for milking. A lusty calf was trying to steal milk from its mother. Chickens were going to roost. Pan {{did not believe that}} any of these had made the call. He was about to ride on by when {{suddenly}} he again caught a strange cry that appeared to come from the barn or shed. It excited rather than frightened him. Sliding off Curly he pushed open <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>board</b> gate and ran in.|$|E

The second round featured cash amounts from $500 to $5,000, and prizes potentially worth $6,000 or more. Three special squares also appeared {{throughout the course of}} the show. The first, Double Your $$, added a cash amount equal to the contestant's score at the time. This square later became Double Your $$ + One Spin, awarding an extra spin in addition to the cash amount. Add-A-One added a [...] "1" [...] {{to the front of the}} contestant's current score (e.g., $0 became $10; $500 became $1,500; and $2,000 became $12,000). The third, $2000 or Lose-1-Whammy, offered the contestant a choice of adding $2,000 to his/her score ($2,000 was automatically added if the contestant had no Whammies), or removing a Whammy received earlier in the game.

2500|$|In 1973 the {{financial}} community posted a collective loss of $245 million, which spurred temporary {{help from the}} government.

About 100 Chinese men lived in jerry-built shacks where the community hall is today.|$|R
