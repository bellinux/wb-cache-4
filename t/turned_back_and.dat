5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 6June1944, Albermarle {{aircraft}} arrived, carrying the brigade's pathfinders, a company from the 1st Canadian Battalion {{to clear the}} drop zone (DZ) of obstructions, a group from each battalion, and brigade headquarters. Some planes got lost and failed to reach the DZ or arrived late.

5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{a prelude}} to the Carnation Revolution, {{in the early morning}} of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Exército), {{attempted}} to stage a coup d'état against the country's authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval. The regiment <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, 40 days later.|$|E

5|$|Monti {{made three}} {{attempts}} to reach Bradbury. On his first, he advanced to within {{three feet of}} Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire. His second try was similarly <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{as the rest of}} his patrol provided covering fire, Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG. Some news reports indicated that the explosion blew off both of his legs, but this is not supported by family accounts or military records. Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover. He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he loved them. Monti died moments later. At about the same time, the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position, killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E

25|$|In 1800, Créole {{was part}} of a {{division}} under contre-amiral Lacrosse, tasked to cruise off Morbihan and cut off the royalists from their British support. In order to avoid the British blockade, the squadron anchored to Camaret, but attracted the attention of the British and sailed back to harbour to avoid engagement. The division was retasked to ferry 4600 troops to Santo Domingo, but again ran into the British blockade, <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> adjourned its mission. During the cruise, Créole sustained some damage in a collision with Fidèle.|$|E
25|$|Through Hannibal's {{inability}} to take strategically important Italian cities, through the general loyalty Italian allies showed to Rome, and through Rome's own {{inability to}} counter Hannibal {{as a master}} general, Hannibal's campaign continued in Italy inconclusively for sixteen years. Though he managed to sustain his forces for 15 years, Hannibal did so only by ravaging farm-lands, keeping his army healthy, which brought anger among the Romans' subject states. Realizing that Hannibal's army was outrunning its supply lines quickly, Rome took countermeasures against Hannibal's home base in Africa by sea command and stopped the flow of supplies. Hannibal quickly <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> rushed to home defense, but suffered defeat in the Battle of Zama (202 BC).|$|E
25|$|At 04:00 on 24 June, at {{position}} , almost the midpoint between Menorca and Toulon, the frigate squadrons sighted one another. Dido, the leading British ship, sent coded {{signals to the}} French, who failed to answer, confirming their nationality. As the British advanced, the French tacked away, and rapidly outdistanced the British ships. At 08:00 however with visibility improving, the diminutive size of the British ships became apparent and the French squadron <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> bore down on Dido and Lowestoffe. At 08:30, Minerve {{was close enough to}} Dido to fire a broadside, although Towry elected not to return fire until Minerve had closed further.

25|$|The {{disciples of}} the Vilna Gaon {{settled in the}} land of Israel almost a decade after the arrival of two of his pupils, R. Hayim of Vilna and R. Israel ben Samuel of Shklov. In all there were three groups of the Gaon's {{students}} which emigrated to the land of Israel. They formed the basis of the Ashkenazi communities of Jerusalem and Safed, setting up what was known as the Kollel Perushim. Their arrival encouraged an Ashkenazi revival in Jerusalem, whose Jewish community until this time was mostly Sephardi. Many of the descendants of the disciples became leading figures in modern Israeli society. The Gaon himself also set forth with his pupils to the Land, but for an unknown reason he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> returned to Vilna, where he died soon after.|$|E

He then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> headed toward a JCPenney store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, {{but was unable to}} do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a concealed carry permit holder, drew his Glock 22, claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts saw him and that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|Captain General Ricardos and his Spanish army {{defeated}} the French in a skirmish at Céret on 20 April 1793.

The Siege of Bellegarde lasted from 23 May until 24 June when the French garrison's 1,450 survivors capitulated.
