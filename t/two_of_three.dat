In the game, he {{completed}} all four passes he attempted for 51yards, and led a 71-yard touchdown drive. However, he suffered a twisted foot and ankle during the game, and was sidelined for what was then an indefinite amount of time. Dickinson returned two weeks later, failing to complete a pass {{in a game against}} the Denver Broncos, and allowing another interception that was returned by John Rowser for a touchdown. Dickinson had his most productive outing the following week, completing 7 of 13 passes for 103yards in a loss to the New York Jets. His last game of the season was against the Cleveland Browns.
