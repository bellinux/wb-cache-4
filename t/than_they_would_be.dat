5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E

This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practiced in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, with very little maceration time, by hand, feet or even sack cloth creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{cannot be}} {{estimated}} {{to what extent}} the boycott hurt Israel's economy, the boycott cannot be said to have affected it to the extent the Arabs intended. Israel's economy has performed relatively well since 1948, achieving a higher GDP per capita than that of all Arab countries except for the oil-rich gulf states of Kuwait and Qatar. The boycott nevertheless has undoubtedly harmed Israel to some extent. The Israeli Chamber of Commerce estimates that with the boycott Israeli exports are 10 percent less <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without the boycott and investment in Israel likewise 10 percent lower.|$|E
25|$|Because chronic self-concepts and {{self-esteem}} {{play an important}} role in understanding the world, providing a sense of coherence, and guiding action, people become motivated to maintain them through self-verification. Such strivings provide stability to people’s lives, making their experiences more coherent, orderly, and comprehensible <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> otherwise. Self-verification processes are also adaptive for groups, groups of diverse backgrounds and the larger society, in that they make people predictable to one another thus serve to facilitate social interaction. To this end, people engage in a variety of activities that are designed to obtain self-verifying information.|$|E
25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is doing for the child. Dr. Lange suggests parents {{should focus on the}} cancer prevention aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants cancer prevention, yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature of}} the cancer—Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon cancer vaccine. The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without the vaccine.|$|E

25|$|In December, President Davis asked Bragg to take {{command of}} the Trans-Mississippi Department, but Bragg declined. He was {{concerned}} for the prospects of victory west of the Mississippi River and about the poorly supplied and ill-disciplined troops there. He was also experiencing one of his periodic episodes of ill health that would plague him throughout the war. For years he had suffered from rheumatism, dyspepsia, nerves, and severe migraine headaches, ailments that undoubtedly contributed to his disagreeable personal style. The command went to Earl Van Dorn. Bragg proposed to Davis that he change his strategy of attempting to defend every square mile of Confederate territory, recommending that his troops were of less value on the Gulf Coast <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> farther to the north, concentrated with other forces for an attack against the Union Army in Tennessee. Bragg transported about 10,000 men to Corinth, Mississippi, in February 1862 and was charged with improving the poor discipline of the Confederate troops already assembled under General Albert Sidney Johnston.|$|E
25|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure the body tissues are therefore normally saturated with nitrogen at 0.758bar (569mmHg). At increased ambient pressures due to depth or habitat pressurisation, a diver's lungs {{are filled with}} breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately. The inert gases from the breathing gas in the lungs diffuse into blood in the alveolar capillaries and are distributed around the body by the systemic circulation in the process known as perfusion. Dissolved materials are transported in the blood much faster <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> distributed by diffusion alone. From the systemic capillaries the dissolved gases diffuse through the cell membranes and into the tissues, where it may eventually reach equilibrium. The greater the blood supply to a tissue, the faster it will reach equilibrium with gas at the new partial pressure. This equilibrium is called saturation. Ingassing appears to follow a simple inverse exponential equation. The {{time it takes for}} a tissue to take up or release 50% of the difference in dissolved gas capacity at a changed partial pressure is called the half-time for that tissue and gas.|$|E

5000|$|Under Chapter 13, {{the debtor}} proposes {{a plan to}} pay his or her {{creditors}} over a 3-to-5 year period. [...] This written plan details all of the transactions (and their durations) that will occur, and repayment according to the plan must begin within 30 to 45 days after the case has started. During this period, his or her creditors cannot attempt to collect on the individual's previously incurred debt except through the bankruptcy court. In general, the individual gets to keep his property, {{and his or her}} creditors end up with less money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> <b>were</b> the amount given to the debtor to continue collecting interest, allowing the debtor {{to find a way to}} pay the amount owed without losing their assets entirely.|$|R
500|$|In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized {{eggs and}} males from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are diploid, with {{two copies of}} each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This {{mechanism}} of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton termed [...] "supersisters", {{more closely related to}} their sisters <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to their own offspring. Workers often do not reproduce, but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters (as queens) than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes), assuming they would produce similar numbers. This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the Hymenoptera.|$|E
500|$|While {{examining}} {{texts in}} the tombs at Saqqara in October, Champollion {{realized that the}} hieroglyphic word for [...] "hour" [...] included the hieroglyph representing a star, which served no phonetic function in the word.

Champollion probably struck upon the concept while in Egypt, as it had not appeared in the 1828 edition of the Précis. Champollion also saw the sphinx and lamented that the inscription on its chest was covered by more sand <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to remove in a week. Arriving in Dendera on November 16, Champollion was excited to see the Zodiac that he had deciphered in Paris. Here he realized that the glyph that he had deciphered as autocrator and which convinced him that the inscription was of recent date was in fact not found on the monument itself – it had seemingly been invented by Jomard's copyist. Champollion nonetheless realized that the late date was still correct, based on other evidence. After a day at Dendera, the expedition continued on to Thebes.|$|E
