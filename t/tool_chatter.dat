40|$|Regenerative machine <b>tool</b> <b>chatter</b> is {{investigated}} for milling operations with helical tools. The stability of a two-degrees-of-freedom milling model is analyzed, where the cutting-force is modeled {{as a force}} system distributed along the rake face of the tool. Introducing a distributed force system instead of a concentrated cutting-force results in an additional short, peri-odically varying distributed delay in the governing equations of the system. It is shown that the additional delay significantly affects {{the stability of the}} machining operation, especially at low spindle speeds. This phenomenon {{is referred to as the}} short regenerative effect, and is studied by computing the stability lobe diagrams of milling operations via the semi-discretization technique. The sensitivity of the stability charts to the shape of the force distribution and the contact length between the chip and tool is investigated.

40|$|Chatter in {{machining}} process {{is one of}} the common failures of a production line. For a cantilever tool, such as a boring bar, the rule of thumb requires the overhang length of the tool to be less than 4 times the diameter. The reason is because longer overhang will induce severe tool vibration in the form of chatter during machining. When a longer overhang than 4 times diameter is necessary for performing special machining operations, damping methods are needed to suppress <b>tool</b> <b>chatter.</b> One of the methods is the constrained layer damping method. Materials, such viscoelastic material, are applied in the vibration node regions of the structure to absorb the concentrated vibration strain energy and transform the mechanical energy to heat. With a cantilever tool clamped in a tool holder, the clamping interface is usually the vibration node region. The friction in the joint interface with low normal pressure became another source of damping and can be used for <b>tool</b> <b>chatter</b> suppression in mechanical structures. Joint interfaces are well known to possess normal pressure dependent stiffness and damping. The normal pressure’s effect on the structures frequency response function had been observed by H. Åkesson [1] et al, and L. Mi [2] et al. However, the direct effect of the joint interface normal pressure on {{machining process}} stability hasn’t been investigated. In this paper, a cantilever tool with 6. 5 overhang length to diameter ratio is investigated. The direct effect of the tool clamping interface’s normal pressure on the machining process stability is studied. Three different levels of clamping normal pressure are tested with an internal turning process.

Design/methodology/approach: A series of experimental tests have been done to evaluate the possibility of high speed fine turning of the austenitic stainless steel from the surface roughness variation and machining stability. Findings: It was found that, the smaller the feed rate, the smaller the surface roughness value. But when the feed rate smaller than the critical feed rate, the chatter will occurs and the surface roughness of the work piece would be deteriorated. The higher the cutting speed is, the higher the cutting temperature of cutting tool is. The cutting tool will be soften and the surface roughness of the workpiece will be deteriorated. Research limitations/implications: The <b>tool</b> <b>chattering</b> would caused poor surface roughness in high speed fine turning for feed rate smaller than 0. 02 mm/rev. The chatter suppression method must be considered when high speed fine turning of austenitic stainless steel.

40|$|Robotic {{operations}} have undeniable advantages {{of speed and}} precision in machining. However, such operations are generally limited by the self-excited <b>tool</b> <b>chatter</b> problem. When uncontrolled, chatter leaves a rough machined surface, accelerates wear of the cutter and creates unacceptably loud noise levels. A conventional approach to suppress chatter is to slow the waste removal rate. Such an action is usually successful to avoid chatter, but causes increased production time and cost. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain a reasonably fast rate of production and employ a chatter control measure.
