In April 2001, Aronofsky entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow {{to direct a}} then-untitled science fiction film, with Brad Pitt in the lead role. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join the film, which Aronofsky, wanting the title to remain secret, had given the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed {{to wait for a}} pregnant Blanchett to give birth to her child in December 2001. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney. By now officially titled The Fountain, the film had a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, which had filled the gap after Village Roadshow withdrew. Pitt left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting, halting production. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected it on a $35 million budget with Hugh Jackman in the lead role. In August, actress Rachel Weisz filled the vacancy left by Blanchett. The Fountain was released on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday; ultimately it grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide.

5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E

Much of the following efforts to establish mechanisms to investigate the war, were undertaken while the protests were active, and <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> these attempts {{on the part of}} Olmert's government, {{played an important role in}} shaping public opinion and arguably, the eventual widening mandate of the commission which was formed.|$|E
25|$|Industrialists soon {{brought the}} nascent field of {{psychology}} {{to bear on}} the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency. This field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology. An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924–1932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist Elton Mayo, Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} that the sockeye salmon are affected by thermal conditions and <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> temperature are relatively strong and tend to vary from region to region. Canada has also used the Species at Risk Act to {{recognize the importance of}} biological diversity when it come to the conservation of the salmon population. This means that multiple species of salmon would be looked at when it comes to conservation as well as multiple areas that each species live in. COSEWIC, a Canadian organization for the conservation of species, has named the Interior Fraser River Coho, the Cultus Lake Sockeye, and the Sakinaw Lake Sockeye to all be endangered. In British Columbia sockeye salmon in four different watersheds were certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, or MSC, as sustainable fisheries in July 2010 and the certification is good for a period of five years. In 2011 MSC also certified the Pink Salmon Fishery and as of 2012 The Chum Salmon Fisheries started their review under the MSC to become certified as a sustainable fishery.|$|E

Although UN troops limited <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> self-defence, the attacks continued.

500|$|The {{commonly}} heard {{female contact}} call is a shrill, kew-wick but the male has a quavering advertising song hoo...ho, ho, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. William Shakespeare used this owl's song in Love's Labour's Lost (Act 5, Scene 2) as [...] "Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot", but this stereotypical call {{is actually a}} duet, with the female making the kew-wick sound, and the male responding hooo. The call is easily imitated by blowing into cupped hands through slightly parted thumbs, and a study in Cambridgeshire found that this mimicry produced a response from the owl within 30minutes in 94% of trials. A male's response to a broadcast song appears to be indicative of his health and vigour; owls with higher blood parasite loads use fewer high frequencies and a more limited range of frequencies in <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> an apparent intruder.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{applied to}} the University of North Carolina in 1938, but was {{rejected}} because of her race. All schools and other public facilities in the state were segregated. The case was broadly publicized in both white and black newspapers. Murray wrote to officials ranging from the university president to President Roosevelt, releasing <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> the media {{in an attempt to}} embarrass them into action. The NAACP initially was interested in the case, but later declined to represent her in court, perhaps fearing that her long residence in New York state weakened her case. NAACP leader Roy Wilkins opposed representing her because Murray had already released her correspondence, which he considered [...] "not diplomatic". Concerns about her sexuality also may {{have played a role in}} the decision; Murray often wore pants rather than the customary skirts of women and was open about her relationships with women.|$|E
500|$|The game {{occasionally}} {{shifts to}} an icy alternate dimension called [...] "Nightmare", where hostile monsters exist. To escape from this dimension, Harry {{must find a}} predetermined exit while avoiding the wandering creatures which chase him upon detection. Unlike previous installments in the series, there is no combat element to the gameplay: Harry is weaponless for the entire duration {{of the game and}} can only run, hide, slow down the monsters by knocking down objects to block their path, throw off the creatures if they latch onto him, and temporarily ward them off by picking up and using flares found lying on the ground. His running speed and [...] "health" [...] (the amount of damage that he can endure before dying) decrease every time the monsters grab him. In contrast to the previous installments of the series, which featured various types of monsters, Shattered Memories features only one type of humanoid monster, whose physical appearance changes in response to the player's actions inside and outside the Nightmare realm, including <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Kaufmann's psychological tests.|$|E

Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the basic}} {{variegated}} anatomical {{structure of the}} brain is laid down during early development, it {{is more or less}} fixed. But given the numerous and diverse collection of available circuitry, there are bound to be functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-isomorphic neuronal groups capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where circuit groups proficient in <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> certain inputs are [...] "chosen" [...] through the enhancement of the synaptic efficacies of the selected network. This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time. This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. And these adjustments allow for neural plasticity along a fairly quick timetable.|$|E
2500|$|C fibers synapse to second-order {{projection}} neurons in {{the spinal}} cord at the upper laminae of the dorsal horn in the substantia gelatinosa. The second-order projection neurons are of the wide dynamic range (WDR) type, which receive input from both nociceptive terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers. There are three types of second order projection neurons in the spinothalamic tract: wide dynamic range (WDR), high threshold (HT), and low threshold (LT). These classifications are based on <b>their</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> mechanical stimuli. [...] The second-order neurons ascend to the brain stem and thalamus in the ventrolateral, or anterolateral, quadrant of the contralateral half of {{the spinal cord}}, forming the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally. This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury.|$|E
