50|$|A {{torque tester}} {{is used as}} a quality control device to test or {{calibrate}} torque controlled tools. This includes electronic <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> click <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> dial <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches,</b> electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, and torque screwdrivers. Today’s advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in·oz, in·lb, ft·lb, N·m, cN·m, kgf·cm, gf·cm, kgf·fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant).|$|E
50|$|A dental <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> or {{restorative}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> used {{to precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener bolt for fixation of an abutment, dentures or prostetics on a dental implant.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact wrench, because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. This is why an electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy.The electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic.|$|R
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact wrench, due to their similar appearance. A pneumatic <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the Hammers of an impacting <b>wrench.</b> A pneumatic <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy.|$|R

50|$|As {{with any}} {{precision}} tool, <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> should be periodically re-calibrated. As previously stated, according to ISO standards calibration should happen every 5000 operations or every year, whichever comes first. It {{is possible that}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> can fall up to 10% out of calibration {{in the first year}} of use.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> in the UK. <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electric}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is {{a planetary}} torque multiplier or a [...] "Gearbox" [...] mated to an electric motor. At {{the end of}} the [...] "gearbox" [...] is a reaction device that is used to absorb the torque. This allows the operator of the tool to use the electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> with very little effort.|$|R

50|$|Another Dr. Merritt {{design was}} the 'Slimline' torque wrench mechanism. Prior to the 'Slimline', all Norbar <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> used an external, {{break-back}} mechanism. The 'Slimline' {{was the first}} Norbar design to completely contain the mechanism within the body tube of the wrench, hence the 'Slim' reference. The 'Slimline' torque wrench was launched in 1963 and some models remain in production today. Variations in this mechanism underpin most of Norbar's current <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches.</b>|$|E

50|$|Toggle <b>torque</b> <b>{{wrenches}}</b> (friction-style) and beam wrenches (spring-style) are {{the most}} common types in dentistry as manual mechanical torque-limiting devices. Beam type wrenches in general are more consistent to its calibration than toggle types. The beam types with a dial indicator {{are the most}} precise to set the Tare torque (zero point reset). Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur.|$|E

30|$|We have {{introduced}} a simple technique for mounting a hand driver onto a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench.</b> This technique {{makes it easy}} for each dentist to measure the maximum torque that can be exerted by a hand driver he or she is using. Even when using different implant systems, similar machining can be done to make components that can be mounted onto a <b>torque</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is significantly}} quieter, lighter weight and {{more accurate than}} pneumatic impact wrenches capable of similar torque output, making it an appealing alternative for many users to the very loud and cumbersome impact <b>wrenches</b> or <b>torque</b> multipliers which were formerly the only viable option for working with very large nuts and bolts until the hydraulic <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was introduced.|$|R

If the extension is set at 90° then no adjustment is required. These methods are not recommended except for extreme circumstances.|$|R
