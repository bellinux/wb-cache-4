50|$|On October 30, 1929, Japanese {{students}} in the train station in Naju harassed a few Korean female students. This incident was the initial cause of anti-Japanese demonstrations in various high schools in Gwangju. On November 3 — coincidentally both the birthday of Emperor Meiji (明治節) and Gaecheonjeol (Hangul:개천절, Hanja: 開天節), the National Foundation Day of Korea — students were forced to sing the Kimigayo, the national anthem of Japan and hymn to the its emperor. Instead of reluctantly singing it, students remained silent or shouted for independence.

5000|$|Students need {{something}} complex that challenges them to explore: Students need {{to engage with}} the phenomena of study, not schematic substitutes. It is in struggling with complex problems that every learner undergoes the process of constructing their own knowledge. As learners experience internal cognitive conflicts in what they believe about the subject matter, their minds become more deeply engaged with the problem at hand. Learners' efforts in figuring out questions and puzzles are more productive than knowing the right answer because higher order thinking processes are involved. Therefore, teachers of critical exploration value the diverse efforts <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>make</b> during their explorations even where these efforts do not arrive at expected answers. In facilitating this investigative work, the questions that are asked {{over and over again}} by students and teachers alike are, for example: [...] "What do you notice?" [...] What do you mean?" [...] "How are you thinking about it?" [...] "Why do you think that?" [...] "Is that the same as what (someone else) thought they saw?" [...] "How did you figure that?" [...] "How did you do that?" [...] "How does that fit with what she just said?" [...] "Could you give an example?" [...] The responses that teachers and students give to each other might have the form of: [...] "I don't quite get it." [...] "It doesn't make sense (to me)." [...] "I don't really get that; could you explain it another way?" [...] Hence, most important: It is the students who make sense and understand by trying out their ideas, explaining them to others, and seeing how this holds up in other people's and their own eyes and {{in the light of the}} phenomena itself (Duckworth, 2002).|$|E
50|$|Enrolling {{into the}} George Washington University's Columbian College of the Arts and Sciences, the {{students}} {{get the opportunity}} to engage in a rigorous liberals arts curriculum, featuring a wide range of courses in the humanities, sciences, and mathematics. Taking advantage of the program's opportunity to nurture personal independence, the scholars are allowed the agency to choose a maximum of five three or four credit-courses each semester out of the 100+ courses offered at the university, however, as a safety net these choices must be approved by the Program Director. Classes are chosen along with consideration to the required set of courses approved by the District of Columbia Public School system that will satisfy the completion of the high school curriculum. Rigor is strongly encouraged, but it advised <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>make</b> honest wise choices with regards to their personal strengths and capabilities. A minimum of sixty credit hours are required for each student to graduate with an Associates of the Arts Degree from GWU, and to ensure that the students are successful in meeting the credit requirements for the Columbian College the program has been designated Academic Advisor, who meets with each student over the course of their two years to discuss proposed scheduling, incomplete requirements, and logistical concerns with the university's administration. While the opportunity to earn an associate degree while in high school is a remarkable accomplishment that all candidates strive to meet, the program puts priority on each students completion of their high school course work. The George Washington University may not grant a degree to any student who has not officially completed the School Without Walls Program. As of 2013, all students enrolled in the program have graduated with both a high school diploma and Associates of the Arts degree. Should a student need to complete a class not offered by the university (e.g. Physical Education), arrangements may be made conjunction with the School Without Walls to have the student enrolled in a high school level course built around their full-time schedules at the university.|$|E

5000|$|To {{respond to}} the {{challenges}} facing public education, City Year AmeriCorps members work in schools full-time providing academic support and after school programming. These school partnerships work within a framework known as Whole School, Whole Child (WSWC). This program has several components, aimed at improving school attendance, student behavior, and course performance in English and Mathematics. These three factors, called the [...] "ABCs", are prominent early warning indicators of students at risk of dropping out of high school. According to the study, a student who exhibits even one of these indicators as early as sixth grade has a 25% chance of graduating with their peers. Reaching those same students at the right time, with the correct intervention, can be the difference in whether or not <b>that</b> <b>student</b> <b>makes</b> it to graduation.

Data collection tools consist of knowledge test and interviews. Frequency tables and percentages were used by analyzing students’ explanations as answers to questions on the function information test. Pearson correlation was chosen to state the meaningful difference among the questions, if there is any, on the Function information test also included four different categories.

As a result of the interview, it is most commonly observed <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>make</b> mistakes to understand whether a graphic is a function graphic or not, and about the demonstration of the table and function especially on the function information test...|$|E
