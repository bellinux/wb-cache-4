500|$|Despite {{retiring}} officially {{from the}} company, Marcus {{continued to be}} closely involved as an advisor even through the final weeks of his life. He established a sideline as a retailing consultant, maintaining regular business hours in his offices at Crescent Court {{for more than a}} decade and offering advice locally to luxury car dealership Sewell Corporation and hotelier Rosewood Corporation as well as internationally to such businessmen as Mohamed Al-Fayed of Harrods. Called on to consult for Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, the 94-year-old businessman recalled arriving in his customary expensive tailored suit to discover 300 casually dressed employees: [...] "I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> coat, my necktie and my shirt, down to my T-shirt. And then I said, 'Okay. Let’s talk.' I couldn’t have planned it better. It broke the ice. I was on stage for two hours." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, {{but took}} his {{manuscript}} to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards {{he received the}} news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: [...] "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: [...] "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> clothes and began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? That was certainly in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from Euripides about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by jellyfish, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.|$|E

500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, as some have {{attributed}} his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill. In an interview, the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine's Day. He stated, [...] "The script said we were walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt. I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. He's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school? No, no, no. The reason I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shirt for New Moon is because it's written in the book that way. And there's reasons behind it." [...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies." [...] Additionally in 2010, he was ranked fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|She {{converted}} to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. The lavish wedding {{took place on}} [...] in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, [...] "I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine... How I felt then, I {{do not wish to}} describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time." [...] After the many wedding parties were over the newlyweds moved into the Anichkov Palace in Saint Petersburg where they were to live for the next 15 years, when they were not taking extended holidays at their summer villa Livadia in the Crimean Peninsula.|$|E
60|$|They are not large, {{but they}} are very solid and they carry {{themselves}} well. I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat to them as they passed. Then there came the guns.

There are no braver men than the Engineers. Then came the cavalry, Lancers, Cuirassiers, Chasseurs, and Spahis. To all of them in turn I was able to take off my hat, save only to the Spahis.|$|E
