We examine who are actually bearing the burden of increased taxes on natural gas in the EU-area - consumers or exporters. Strategic trade policy and cross-border consumer <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> are of particular interest, as the EU-area increasingly is a net importer of gas. Traditional tax incidence theory presumes spot markets. Natural gas in the EU-area, however, is to a large extent regulated by incomplete long-term contracts. Still, spot market forces could be indicative for <b>tax</b> <b>shifting,</b> by determining the ex post bargaining power in contract renegotiations. By examining <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> in gas sales data we test whether this is the case.

The arising tax loss out of such activities in Europe {{is estimated to be}} around one trillion Euro, while in Germany it is estimated to be around 160 billion euros. In order to counteract this phenomenon states as well as the OECD are developing concepts, practices and actions to combat <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> of corporations on an international base. The true objective is, to pay taxes where the actual added value creation takes place. This bachelor thesis considers the general representation of this subject and provides a deeper look on the different parties involved in <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> operations as well as on their respective motifs. Basic constructions of techniques are outlined and shown. By assumption models it can be determined that in Non-Tax haven countries <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> leads to a substantial economic loss, whereas for countries considered as tax havens this characteristic does not necessarily lead to a greater economic growth in the country. Further it is illustrated to which extent companies are able to establish a competitive advantage over other companies through <b>tax</b> <b>shifting</b> methods. Additionally it becomes obvious that the use of tax havens is finally leading to a closure of gaps in the law within the different tax systems and consequently it will lead to an increased tax justice in the long run...|$|R

In order to evaluate the reform we have developed a structural model of household labour supply which takes into account the labour market equilibrium conditions. Overall, the simulated policy provides a more effective income support and better incentives to work for low wage households and determines an improvement in inequality indexes...|$|R
