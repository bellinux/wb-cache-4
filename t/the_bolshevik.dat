5|$|Meanwhile, {{in tandem}} with larger Serb and Czech {{national}} units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway were involved in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was to show to the Entente that Romanians were still eager {{to fight against the}} Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> or anarchist cells. They resisted especially when <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Russian government asked them to surrender all weapons.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} twenty, {{he formed}} a workers' soviet in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan {{formally}} joined <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (later known as <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Party) and became {{a leader of the}} revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper Sotsyal-Demokrat and later for the Russian-language paper Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta. During this time, he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting.|$|E

5|$|The {{house arrest}} was lifted again in November, and the Constituent Assembly was elected and met in January 1918. Despite being the {{minority}} party, the Bolsheviks dissolved it. On 3 March 1918 (N.S.), <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which effectively ceded vast {{areas of the}} former Russian Empire to the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. On 7 March 1918, Michael and his secretary Johnson were re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police, and imprisoned at <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> headquarters in the Smolny Institute.|$|E

5|$|In the Russian Revolution of 1917 <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian monarchy and instituted Marxism-Leninism.

5|$|Reflecting its {{military}} history, numerous street names {{in and around}} Šiaurės miestelis allude to military concepts, including Kareivių ("Soldiers"), Lakūnų ("Pilots"), Žygio ("March"), Apkasų ("Trenches"), Ulonų ("Light Cavalry"). The new streets built in Šiaurės miestelis during {{the beginning of the}} 21st century were named for prominent figures in Lithuanian military history: Povilas Lukšys, Lithuanian army volunteer, the first to perish in the Independence Wars in 1919 with <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> forces, as well as Kazys Ladyga, Silvestras Žukauskas, Jonas Galvydis-Bikauskas, Vladas Nagevičius, and Jurgis Kubilius, prominent officers of the inter-war Lithuanian Army, whose histories are not directly related to the area. On the contrary, these personalities distinguished themselves by opposing <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> and Polish armies that were historically garrisoned in Šiaurės miestelis. The naming was suggested by the Ministry of Defence. There are more streets not far from Šiaurės miestelis that bear military-themed names: Raitininkų ("Cavalrymen"), Žvalgų ("Scouts") and Rinktinės ("Platoon").|$|E

50|$|In November 1917, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{seized control}} of most of Russia. This led to the Russian Civil War, pitting <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> against <b>the</b> Whites and other counter-revolutionary forces. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{attempted}} to administer Russia's economy purely by decree, a policy dubbed War Communism. Farmers and factory workers were ordered to produce, and food and goods were seized and issued by decree.|$|R
50|$|On April 16, 1917, Vladimir Lenin {{returned}} to Russia from exile from Europe {{and added a}} new element to the situation. As the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> Lenin held an important position in Russia. <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> began to struggle for power with other factions, including the Provisional Government, liberals, royalists, democratic socialists, and Mensheviks. As the months went by, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> continued to gain in influence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{end result}} of the revolt was the {{suppression}} of the Left SRs, the last major independent party other than <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> differentiated between <b>the</b> Left SR leadership and the remainder of the party and soon proclaimed the innocence of the latter. The [...] "Party of the Populists-Communists" [...] and [...] "Party of Revolutionary Communism" [...] split from Left SRs and supported <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets {{issued a}} press decree that let the Bolsheviks {{suppress}} dissident newspapers. After {{the suppression of}} the Golos Truda by <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> government in August 1918, G.P Maximoff, Nikolai Dolenko and Efim Yartchuk established Volny Golos Truda (The Free Voice of Labour).|$|E
5|$|The Russian Civil War (1917–21) {{began after}} the {{provisional}} government collapsed and <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> party assumed power in Russia in October 1917. The principal fighting occurred between <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Red Army {{and the forces}} of the White Army, being a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war a number of foreign armies also took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army—including the Western allies—whilst many foreign volunteers also fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. Despite some pressure from Britain, the Australian Prime Minister, William Hughes, had refused to commit forces to Russia following the end of World War I in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The coal {{shortage}} {{continued to}} worsen until Admiral Souchon {{was forced to}} suspend operations by Yavuz and Midilli through 1917.

5000|$|Her sharp {{criticism}} of the October Revolution and <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> was lessened insofar as she compared the errors of the Revolution and of <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> with <b>the</b> [...] "complete failure of the international proletariat." ...|$|R
50|$|Implementation of the Constantinople Agreement was {{unsuccessful}} due to {{the failure}} of the Gallipoli Campaign which was to conquer Constantinople. Furthermore, the Russian government was overthrown by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> in 1917. <b>The</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> discovered these various above agreements when they gained control over government archives. They then published the agreements but the French and the British completely denied them and claimed that it was propaganda by <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Shortly thereafter, the pro-Iskra delegates {{split into}} two factions. Lenin and his supporters, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> argued for a smaller but highly {{organized}} party, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a larger and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky {{and most of the}} Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> Trotsky left <b>the</b> Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the robbery may {{have been one of the}} sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Petrograd's Finland Station, Lenin gave {{a speech}} to Bolshevik {{supporters}} condemning the Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, he spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing his April Theses, an outline of {{his plans for the}} Bolsheviks, which he had written on the journey from Switzerland. He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries – who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet – for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as traitors to socialism. Considering the government to be just as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war. Over the coming months, he campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Central Committee, prolifically writing for <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> newspaper Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{planned to}} write a book about his {{experience}} in Russia, but he postponed it while he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected. Work on Goldman's book, My Two Years in Russia, was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: My Disillusionment in Russia (1923) and My Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924). Berkman worked on his book, <b>The</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Myth, throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.|$|E
50|$|For their part, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{were willing}} to assist the Jadids in realizing their {{nationalist}} goals, but only on <b>Bolshevik</b> terms. While <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> created <b>the</b> structures needed to fully realize the Jadids' dreams (state-funded schools, a print sphere immune to market forces, new organs of political authority) <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> maintained their own agenda for harnessing the energies of the Jadid mobilization effort. This agenda focused on political education through postering, newspaper articles, film, and theater. Essentially, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> {{wanted to use the}} facilities they had established on the Jadids behalf to disseminate political propaganda and educate the Central Asian masses about the socialist revolution.|$|R

5000|$|During the Kornilov Affair, Kerensky had {{distributed}} {{arms to the}} Petrograd workers, and by November most {{of these}} armed workers had gone over to <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks.</b> On [...] 1917, <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks</b> launched <b>the</b> second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, a subdivision of the 2nd company of the First Petrograd Women's Battalion, also known as The Women's Death Battalion, was willing {{to fight for the}} government against <b>the</b> <b>Bolsheviks,</b> but this force was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces, defeated, and captured.

5|$|Educated in Tiflis and Rome, Agagianian first {{served as}} leader of the Armenian Catholic {{community}} of Tiflis before <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> takeover of the Caucasus in 1921.

5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. <b>The</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) gun in the right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine gun in the left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Bukovsky {{was elected}} President of the Comitatus pro Libertatibus – Comitati per le Libertà – Freedom Committees in Florence, an Italian libertarian {{organisation}} which promoted an annual Memento Gulag, or Memorial Day {{devoted to the}} Victims of Communism, on 7 November (the anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>Bolshevik</b> Revolution). The Memento Gulag has since been held in Rome, Bucharest, Berlin, La Roche sur Yon and Paris.|$|E
