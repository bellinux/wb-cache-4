5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt. <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to explore <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt, New Horizons, was launched, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's {{goal was to}} locate and investigate other, farther objects in <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt proper.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (<b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E

5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects {{approaching}} its size {{had been found in}} the same region of the Solar System (<b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s.

5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is probably a captured plutoid from <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt that probably originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained above, is probably a captured KBO).|$|E

5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, {{may prove to be}} dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} considered part of <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. <b>The</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, <b>the</b> <b>Kuiper</b> belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in 1958 in England, and is a 1979 {{graduate}} of University College, London (UCL). Jewitt received an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in astronomy at the California Institute of Technology in 1980 and 1983, respectively. His research interests cover {{all aspects of the}} solar system, including the trans-Neptunian Solar System, Solar System formation, ice in the asteroids and the physical properties of comets. Along with Jane Luu, he discovered <b>the</b> first <b>Kuiper</b> belt object (other than Pluto and its largest moon Charon) in 1992 and subsequently identified dozens of additional belt members in a series of pioneering wide field surveys. From these, he discovered that the belt is dynamically divided into regions - <b>the</b> classical <b>Kuiper</b> belt (circular, uninclined orbits, exemplified by [...] ), the scattered disc (also called <b>the</b> [...] "scattered <b>Kuiper</b> belt", which bodies have large elliptical orbits with perihelion near Neptune, discovered in 1997) and <b>the</b> Resonant <b>Kuiper</b> belt objects, whose periods are related simply to Neptune's. Those resonant objects in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance he called plutinos as a reminder that Pluto is one such object. These resonant objects can only be explained if Neptune migrated outwards, opening the door to new models of the Solar System in which unsuspected planet-disk and planet-planet interactions can be important.|$|R
