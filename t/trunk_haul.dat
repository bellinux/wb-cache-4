50|$|The Forth and Clyde Junction Railway was {{incorporated}} by Act of Parliament on 4 August 1853; {{the line was}} to be 30 miles (48 km) in length, and the <b>trunk</b> <b>haul</b> traffic, minerals westbound to the Clyde and manufactured textiles from the Leven dyeworks eastbound, was to be dominant.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, before electrification, {{this bridge}} had both stairs and a ramp for porters' {{trolleys}} {{on the up}} (westbound) platform, and from the landing above the eastbound platform there was the passageway to the door onto Terrace Road, a staircase down to the platform, and an archway through to an external, stone-flagged ramp down to another archway back into the building and platform area. [...] Thus luggage (which in the 19th century would have consisted of large steamer <b>trunks,</b> and been <b>hauled</b> by a porter on a large four wheeled trolley) could be moved from one platform to the other as required.|$|R
40|$|Location {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} locating one or more service facilities while fulfilling some constraints such as the demand of the customers and minimizing the total cost. Despite the cost of transporting goods or services, there is a fixed cost associated with opening a given facility such {{as the cost of}} the land, taxes or <b>trunking</b> (or <b>hauling)</b> cost to supply product, services and labour. This cost may vary from one area to another. The aim {{of this study is to}} put forward a Simulated Annealing (SA) procedure for solving the uncapacitated continuous location-allocation problem in the presence of a zone-dependent fixed cost. Simulated Annealing is one of the meta-heuristic methods derived from the annealing process of a solid. Several parameters in SA will be tested such as initial starting points, initial temperature and cooling schedules. Data set for 50 customer problem taken from the literature is used. The problems of locating 2 to 15 facilities are solved by using C++. The computational results are presented with encouraging results. ...|$|R
25|$|On 4 April 2011, a fire {{broke out}} on a Di 8 {{locomotive}} at Kl√∏fta on the <b>Trunk</b> Line while <b>hauling</b> a 16-wagon train of jet fuel to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as {{he thought it was}} an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The Accident Investigation Board Norway criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement.|$|R
6000|$|Plez {{was quite}} {{ready for a}} {{reckless}} dash of this kind, and in less than twenty minutes old Patsy was informed that Mr Null had arrived. The old woman was much affected by the information. She was uneasy and restless, and talked a good deal to herself, occasionally throwing out a moan or a lament {{in the direction of}} her [...] "son Tom's yaller boy Bob's chile." [...] The crazy quilt, which was not yet finished, though several pieces had been added since we last saw it, was laid aside; and by the help of the above mentioned great granddaughter the old hair <b>trunk</b> was <b>hauled</b> out and opened. Over this hoard of treasures, Aunt Patsy spent nearly two hours, slowly taking up the various articles it contained, turning them over, mumbling over them, and mentally referring many of them to periods which had become historic. At length she pulled out from one of the corners of the trunk a pair of very little blue morocco shoes tied together by their strings. These she took into her lap, and, shortly afterward, had the trunk locked, and pushed back into its place. The shoes, having been thoroughly examined through her great iron-bound spectacles, were thrust under the mattress of her bed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{excitement}} {{caused by}} the 1848 gold find in California reached Louisiana. Ames soon caught the gold fever, closed his office, and went to California via the Isthmus of Panama. He landed in San Francisco on October 28, 1849, without any money. Borrowing a handcart, he began <b>hauling</b> <b>trunks</b> and luggage, and always kept as a souvenir {{the first piece of}} money he earned at this employment. He was soon able to advance to the occupation of newspaper writer, and was for a time connected, in an editorial role, with the Placer Times and Transcript. He also wrote for other newspapers under his favorite pen-name of [...] "Boston". In 1850, he made a trip to Honolulu, and it was probably immediately upon his return that he learned of the need to establish a newspaper in San Diego's New Town. He paid a visit to San Diego and issued a prospectus in December, 1850. There were similar interests in Los Angeles {{for the establishment of a}} newspaper. The first issue of La Estrella de Los Angeles appeared May 17, 1851, and thus it became the pioneer newspaper of the Southwest; Ames's San Diego Herald came out on May 29, just twelve days later.|$|R
