5|$|URBED (the Urban and Economic Development Group), a not-for-profit urban {{regeneration}} consultancy, designed and developed the {{master plan for}} the scheme {{on behalf of the}} New England Consortium. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of companies and interested parties which together have the overall responsibility for the scheme, including Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, J. Sainsbury Developments Ltd and Quintain Estates and Development (QED). The land was originally owned by British Rail, but passed to Railtrack when the railway system was privatised in the mid-1990s. It was sold to the New England Consortium in 1997. An initial planning application, including a new Sainsbury's supermarket, was rejected by the council in November 1997; the rejection was subsequently upheld on appeal in September 1998. URBED were then asked to develop a new master plan for the site. This design statement was published in July 2001, and was granted planning permission by Brighton & Hove City Council at the end of 2002. Construction work on the site began on 19 July 2004.|$|E
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E
25|$|One such group {{refers to}} {{itself as the}} New Order Mormons, a name {{patterned}} on the term New Order Amish (Amish who maintain cultural ties to their religion while not accepting some of its core tenets). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of Mormons and former Mormons who no longer believe {{at least some of}} the tenets of the LDS Church, but because of family or cultural ties do not choose to completely separate themselves from the faith.|$|E

25|$|The subgroups {{discussed}} {{so far are}} {{not only}} infinite, they are also continuous (Lie groups). Any subgroup containing at least one non-zero translation must be infinite, but subgroups of the orthogonal group can be finite. For example, the symmetries of a regular pentagon consist of rotations by integer multiples of 72° (360° / 5), along with reflections in the five mirrors which perpendicularly bisect the edges. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> D5, with 10 elements. It has a subgroup, C5, of half the size, omitting the reflections. These two groups are members of two families, Dn and Cn, for any n > 1. Together, these families constitute the rosette groups.|$|E
25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E

By February 1953, the inquiry had come to implicate Rabinsohn, arrested for his contacts with Zissu, and then Pauker herself, who was deposed by Gheorghiu-Dej and other rivals. Zissu's wife was not imprisoned, but she was forced out of their apartment, and lived in the hallway.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{important}} work {{from this period}} are the [...] "Sonnets of Misfortune" [...] (Sonetje nesreče), which were first drafted already in 1832, but {{were published in the}} 4th volume of Krajnska čbelica only in July 1834, with some changes. They are the most pessimistic of Prešeren's works. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of six (initially seven) sonnets expressing the poet's despair over life. In the first sonnet, titled [...] "O Vrba," [...] Prešeren reflects on what his life could have been like, had he never left his home village.

2500|$|The BNP {{adheres to}} an {{ideology}} of ethnic nationalism. It promotes {{the idea that}} not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation. Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to [...] "the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society". <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> that Griffin {{referred to as the}} [...] "home people" [...] or [...] "the folk". According to Tyndall, [...] "The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism." [...] Richard Edmonds in 1993 told The Guardians Duncan Campbell that [...] "we [...] are 100% racist". The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as [...] "British", and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as [...] "black Britons" [...] or [...] "Asian Britons", instead describing them as [...] "racial foreigners".|$|E
2500|$|This story {{tells of}} the [...] "Second Expedition" [...] to Mars. The {{expedition}} {{is a group of}} four men. The astronauts arrive to find the Martians to be strangely unresponsive to their presence. The one exception to <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of Martians in a building who greet them with a parade. Several of the Martians in the building claim to be from Earth or from other planets of the solar system, and the captain slowly realizes that the Martian gift for telepathy allows others to view the hallucinations of the insane, and that they have been placed in an insane asylum. The Martians they have encountered all believed that their unusual appearance was a projected hallucination. Because the [...] "hallucinations" [...] are so detailed and the captain refuses to admit he is not from Earth, Mr. Xxx, a psychiatrist, declares him incurable and kills him. When the [...] "imaginary" [...] crew does not disappear as well, Mr. Xxx shoots and kills them too. Finally, as the [...] "imaginary" [...] rocket remains in existence, Mr. Xxx concludes that he too must be crazy and shoots himself. The ship of the Second Expedition is sold as scrap at a junkyard.|$|E
