A migrated layout inheriting original topology owns original design intention and predictable property, such as wire length which determines the path delay importantly. This work presents a new rectangular <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> to preserve layout topology and combine its flexibility of handling wires with traditional scan-line based compaction algorithm for area minimization. The proposed migration flow contains devices and wires extraction, <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> construction, unidirectional compression combining scan-line algorithm with collinear equation solver, and wire restoration.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is an {{algorithm}} generating topological layouts for VLSI-circuits that are specified by means of programs. A <b>topological</b> <b>layout,</b> which is both a metric-free and a material-free layout, is an intermediate step in the process of converting a program into a silicon chip. The algorithm described in this paper is based upon a bottom-up approach, while lazy evaluation, constituted by the postponement of the construction of some connections, guarantees a flexible connecting to different environments...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for generating stress-constrained topological designs in continua is presented. The main novelty {{is in the}} use of elasto-plastic modeling and in optimizing the design such that it will exhibit a linear-elastic response. This is achieved by imposing a single global constraint on the total sum of equivalent plastic strains, providing accurate control over all local stress violations. The single constraint essentially replaces a large number of local stress constraints or an approximate aggregation of them [...] two common approaches in the literature. A classical rate-independent plasticity model is utilized, for which analytical adjoint sensitivity analysis is derived and verified. Several examples demonstrate the capability of the computational procedure to generate designs that challenge results from the literature, in terms of the obtained stiffness-strength-weight trade-offs. A full elasto-plastic analysis of the optimized designs shows that prior to the initial yielding, these designs can sustain significantly higher loads than minimum compliance <b>topological</b> <b>layouts,</b> with only a minor compromise on stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that the way of approaching Estonian concepts of emotion may influence their emergent structure. One hundred participants assessed the semantics of 24 words in two different tests that provided access to the concepts from two different levels of representation of knowledge of emotions. The first task addressed the semantic interrelations of emotion terms (synonymy and antonymy) and the second addressed the qualities of emotional experience as measured on seven scales. The results were visualized by self-organizing maps, revealing two visually different <b>topological</b> <b>layouts,</b> where coherence of the conceptual structure was recognizable only in general terms. Two main clusters, positivity and negativity, were found in both maps. In addition, a cluster of alertness emerged while the concepts were accessed through the interrelations of emotion words. There was much less coherence for local neighbourhood relations. That is, relations which coincided on both maps were identified only in approximately half of the cases...|$|R
40|$|Despite the evident {{advantages}} of double layered grid structures to produce freeform and aesthetically pleasing designs, {{the challenge in}} their application lies in the computational cost associated with the optimization of their layout and limitations in their fabrication. Conway operators are an efficient tool for the manipulation of such structures, producing complex yet aesthetically pleasing <b>topological</b> <b>layouts.</b> This paper presents a computational workflow {{for the evaluation of}} double layered grid structures generated using Conway operators. After defining the operators applied, the structure is optimized in compliance with structural design criteria. The inherent modularity of such layouts significantly reduces the computational resources required, {{while at the same time}} facilitates the fabrication process. The tool is applied on an existing structure available in literature on which different topologies are evaluated. As a result, a decrease in the overall mass of the structure is achieved, while insightful information for the structural behaviour of the different operators is obtained. The potentials for future evolution of this approach are hence highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Post-layout is an {{important}} stage in the modern VLSI de-sign. With the completed detail routing, {{it is the only}} stage where extraction and veri¯cation tools can get accurate re-sults for further optimization. But the problem is that de-sign optimization or modi¯cation are very hard to perform in the post-layout stage, because most layout elements are under tight geometry constraints due to the routing. In this paper we propose a new method to resolve this problem, named TEG. Based on an improved <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> rep-resentation and a set of layout operation algorithms, TEG provides an incremental layout modi¯cation environment for the post-layout applications. Experimental results showed that TEG was e±cient and e®ective in processing industry VLSI designs. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: System {{reliability}} is a {{major challenge}} in system design. Unreliable systems are not only major source of user frustration, they are also expensive. Unfortunately, with the large component count in today's large-scale systems, failures are quickly becoming the norm rather than the exception. The reliability characteristic such as probability of survival, mean time to failure, frequency of failures and mean down time depend on the design and <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> of the system. Common cause failure is an important phenomenon for a system with failure dependent parts. This paper deals with a single unit system that is operating in an environment exposed to the hazards of common cases failures, under some general assumptions the optional replacement policies were developed {{with the help of}} proposed measure of cost differences for old and new system...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to underline that, to define a good WNP, {{it is necessary to}} satisfy two crucial major requirements for the optimal functioning of a WDN: 1) network connectivity, i.e. each demand node of the water network must be connected to at least one water source, and 2) nodal minimum pressure, i.e. each node must have a pressure equal or higher than the minimum level of service that allows satisfying the water demand of the users. Therefore, the design of a WNP, as any problem of network subdivision, is a complex challenge for operators, because the permanent partitioning changes the original <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> of water systems. Indeed, network partitioning, achieved by pipe closures, reduces the overall pipe section availability, with the consequent decrease of network water pressure, especially during peak hours, worsening the level of service offered to users.|$|E
40|$|Graph layout is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a visual representation of a graph through a node-link diagram. Node-attribute graphs have additional data stored on the nodes which describe certain properties of the nodes called attributes. Typical force-directed representations often produce hairball-like structures that neither aid in understanding the graph's topology nor the relationship to its attributes. The aim of this research was to investigate the use of node-attributes for graph layout in order to improve the analysis process and to give further insight into the graph over purely <b>topological</b> <b>layouts.</b> In this article we present graphTPP, a graph based extension to targeted projection pursuit (TPP) [...] - an interactive, linear, dimension reduction technique [...] - as a method for graph layout and subsequent further analysis. TPP allows users to control the projection and is optimised for clustering. Three case studies were conducted in the areas of influence graphs, network security, and citation networks. In each case graphTPP was shown to outperform standard force-directed techniques and even other dimension reduction methods in terms of clarity of clustered structure in the layout, the association between the structure and the attributes and the insights elicited in each domain area.

40|$|SUMMARY Layout {{has strong}} {{influence}} on matching properties of a circuit. Current matching models, which characterize both local random non-uniformities and global systematic non-uniformities stochastically, are not adequate for the matching analysis taking {{the effect of}} layout realization into account. In order to consider <b>topological</b> information of <b>layout</b> into matching analysis, we propose a matching model which treats the random and systematic components separately. Also, we characterize the micro-loading effect, which modulates fabricated line-width according to the local density of layout patterns, into matching analysis. With these two techniques, we can perform matching analysis of CMOS circuits taking layout information into account. key words: CMOS, matching, micro-loading-effect, fluctuation 1...|$|R

It is particularly useful {{to form a}} monolithic compliant mechanism in MEMS application. However, the formation of hinges-like portion is typically encountered as a major unsolved problem. Such hinges unavoidably exist in the <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> but cannot practically manufacture. This paper proposes an approach using the analytic single-axis flexure hinge integrated with the formal optimization as a post-design process to obtain optimum flexure hinges and its location for promoting the overall performance. A compliant micro gripper/magnifying mechanism is adopted as an example to illustrate the presenting approach; and a multi-objective optimization problem consisting of several constraints are constructed to determine nine unknowns. The numerical experiment shows the proposed post-optimum design is effective and can be utilized to other similar design situation...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters determining the performance of communication networks is network reliability. The network reliability strongly depends on not only <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> of the communication networks but also reliability and availability of the communication facilities. The selection of optimal network topology is an NP-hard problem so that computation time of enumeration-based methods grows exponentially with network size. This paper presents a new solution approach based on cross-entropy method, called NCE, to design of communication networks. The design problem is to find a network topology with minimum cost such that all-terminal reliability is not less than a given level of reliability. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed NCE, comparisons with other heuristic approaches given in the literature for the design problem are carried out in a three-stage experimental study. Computational results show that NCE is an effective heuristic approach to design of reliable networks.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new multi-level algorithm to draw graphs {{based on the}} topological features they contain. Topological features are recursively detected and their subgraphs are collapsed into single nodes, forming a graph hierarchy. Once the hierarchy is computed, we draw the subgraphs of the hierarchy, using an appropriate algorithm for each <b>topological</b> feature. Our <b>layout</b> algorithms are areaaware: the space required to draw a topological feature is taken into account when the node representing that feature is drawn {{at a higher level}} of the hierarchy. Unlike previous work, TopoLayout can be geared to graphs that contain specific topological features to produce layouts that emphasize those features without asymptotic or empirical runtime penalty. ...|$|R

The algorithm consists of two phases, computing a loose homotopy with four spokes matrices, and computing a vertex-disjoint rubber-band equivalent of the given homotopy, each phase taking O(I F I.

From the vertex-disjoint rubber-band equivalent of the given homotopy, one can obtain the detailed routing within the same time complexity. Experimental results are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Adders {{are very}} {{often in the}} {{critical}} path of a computer, so {{it is very important}} that their performance will not limit the cycle time of the machine. In VLSI applications, area and power are also important factors which must be taken into account in the design of a fast adder. One choice is the carry-skip adder, which because of its great <b>topological</b> regularity and <b>layout</b> simplicity is considered a good compromise in terms of area and performance. Some general rules have been suggested for its design, but they tend to overlook many important implementation details and cannot be applied to carry-skip adders with more than two levels of carry-skip or with different delays in the carry paths. The result is a non-optimal distribution of groups and sub-groups where the carryskip circuits are placed, degrading the worst case delay of the adder.

40|$|The {{concept of}} network-on-chip (NoC) [1] is an {{emerging}} field in VLSI in which networking principles {{play an important}} role. As the number of modules on a chip multiplies, on-chip communication solutions are evolving. Traditional solutions based on shared-buses have hit their scalability limit, hence chip architectures rather employ interconnection network with short links connected by routers. Many challenges {{have yet to be}} tackled. An important issue is to define routing schemes on NoC topologies in order to allow packets to be routed to diverse destinations. Such topologies are often laid onto planar graphs or grids. NoC architectures are based on packet-switched networks and routers can implement various protocols from simple switching to intelligent routing. In this presentation, we address unicast routing, where the packets have a single destination and where routing always follows a deterministic path on the network. The goal is the construction of shortest origin destination paths with no conflicts between packets allowing a given bandwidth between NoC components. It is assumed that traffic requirements are known in advance, as it is often the case for special purpose applications, and the NoC's <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> is already given. First, we state the optimisation problem. Then, we propose a heuristic and a metaheuristic approach to address this problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{itself with}} <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> optimization of layered shell structures. Because shell structures {{have the capability}} to efficiently carry loads with a minimum amount of material, shells are widely used in major engineering structures such as aerospace structures, ship hulls, car bodies and etc. Given the importance of shell structures, many researchers have investigated the use of topology optimization techniques for this class of problems. The conventional approach is to use a density-based formulation. In various challenging topology optimization problems, the recently proposed element connectivity parameterization (ECP) method was found to have significant advantages over conventional density-based approaches. Examples are increased numerical robustness under large deflections, ease of including complex nonlinear materials, and improved accuracy in certain multi-physics settings. In order to exploit these benefits also in the important class of shell structure problems, the focus of this research is on the application of the ECP approach to topology optimization of shell structures. In our previous research, we developed an ECP-based formulation for the topology optimization of open shell structures, based on a decoupling of the bending and membrane modes of a given shell element. However, closed shell structures with local reinforcements are much more common in practice. In this contribution, we therefore extend the formulation to the reinforcement topology optimization of layered shell structures, considering both symmetric and asymmetric laminates. In addition to a detailed discussion of this new formulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by various numerical examples...|$|E
40|$|Traditional logic {{minimization}} {{techniques have}} attempted to minimize a circuit in terms of logic gates. For example, PLAs require minimization of a function in terms of AND columns and OR columns. Synthesis with standard cell also involves minimization in terms of standard gates such as NAND, NOR, inverters etc. However, such minimization at gate level (or even at the transistor level) do not necessarily lead to the most efficient VLSI realizations since the logic gate model {{does not reflect the}} restrictions of actual placement and routing in a VLSI circuit. A graph-theoretic model has already been proposed by the VLSI research group of University of Windsor, which is isomorphic to a realizable VLSI structure. It has been recognized that reducing the transistor count does not necessarily minimize the layout area and that the cost of routing wires is also vitally important. Therefore, taking into account the routing complexity in the VLSI array, the goal has been to manipulate the graph-based model to achieve area-optimized, multi-level CMOS VLSI circuits. In this thesis, we have implemented the graph theoretic model in the paradigm of logic programming and developed a <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> generator based on that model and thereby demonstrated the feasibility of its application to the realistic ASIC design problems.

40|$|Typically {{software}} engineers implement their software {{according to}} the design of the software structure. Relations between classes and interfaces such as method-call relations and inheritance relations are essential parts of a software structure. Accordingly, analyzing several types of relations will benefit the static analysis process of the software structure. The tasks of this analysis include but not limited to: understanding of (legacy) software, checking guidelines, improving product lines, finding structure, or re-engineering of existing software. Graphs with multi-type edges are possible representation for these relations considering them as edges, while nodes represent classes and interfaces of software. Then, this multiple type edges graph can be mapped to visualizations. However, the visualizations should deal with the multiplicity of relations types and scalability, and they should enable the software engineers to recognize visual patterns at the same time. To advance the usage of visualizations for analyzing the static structure of software systems, I tracked difierent development phases of the interactive multi-matrix visualization (IMMV) showing an extended user study at the end. Visual structures were determined and classified systematically using IMMV compared to PNLV in the extended user study as four categories: High degree, Within-package edges, Cross-package edges, No edges. In addition to these structures that were found in these handy tools, other structures that look interesting for software engineers such as cycles and hierarchical structures need additional visualizations to display them and to investigate them. Therefore, an extended approach for graph layout was presented that improves the quality of the decomposition and the drawing of directed graphs {{according to the}}ir topology based on rigorous definitions. The extension involves describing and analyzing the algorithms for decomposition and drawing in detail giving polynomial time complexity and space complexity. Finally, I handled visualizing graphs with multi-type edges using small-multiples, where each tile is dedicated to one edge-type utilizing the <b>topological</b> graph <b>layout</b> to highlight non-trivial cycles, trees, and DAGs for showing and analyzing the static structure of software.

40|$|My thesis aims {{to analyse}} {{the print media}} and {{broadcast}} media, and how they communicate, mediated and crafted meaning around the May 2008 xenophobic riots. This study adopts a ‘whole-age’ analysis of news coverage, so as to examine the <b>topological</b> <b>layout</b> {{and the relationship between}} continuous texts, photographs, captions and most importantly latent and manifest messages in the media. It aims to broaden and deepen the social, political and historical thrust of analyses of various narratives in more intrinsic ways. The thesis is informed by the school of thought (Hanks, 1989; Briggs, 1996) that narratives have dialogic characters, extracting discourse from one setting and inserting it in a new setting so as to facilitate and foster understanding by drawing on common frames of reference and from readers’ memories. Through a critical discourse and semiotic analysis, this study analyses mediations of violence and starts with perceptions, through the reportage of a multilingual sample of news: iSolezwe (isiZulu daily newspaper), iLanga (isiZulu biweekly newspaper), Alex News (fortnightly community newspaper), the Daily Sun (daily tabloid), and the Mail and Guardian (weekly newspaper). I examine how in a span of three weeks (11 May - 3 June 2008), these five newspapers covered the xenophobic riots – I pay particular attention to what emphases they foregrounded and how they narrated the violence. I further analyse three television news reports, two SABC news reports produced by Special Assignment and one eTV news report produced by 3 rd Degree. I examine how they commentated on the riots and what silences existed in their commentary. Lastly, I examine the Bona Fides civic movement as a mediating lens for the enactment of citizenship and negotiation of democracy. The interviews conducted in Alexandra uncovered respondents’ understanding of citizenship and local discourse pertaining to insiders and outsiders. The interviews act as a mediation vehicle and give glimpses of local perceptions which exist in 2013 and, from my reading, also existed back in 2008. This selection of the media showed how pan-African identity, and interestingly, a Zulu Diaspora narrative were used to mediate the violence and foster a culture of integration. The various modes of the media illustrated South Africa’s vibrant political economy in 2008. Moreover, this sample illustrates how a strategic usage of autochthony was employed and deployed by frustrated South Africans, and also how the negotiation of democracy was central to this media selection and selected respondents...|$|E
