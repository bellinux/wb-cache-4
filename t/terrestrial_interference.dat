50|$|A typical {{satellite}} has up to 32 Ku-band or 24 C-band transponders, or {{more for}} Ku/C hybrid satellites. Typical transponders each have a bandwidth between 27 and 50 MHz. Each geostationary C-band satellite needs to be spaced 2° longitude from the next satellite to avoid interference; for Ku the spacing can be 1°. This {{means that there is}} an upper limit of 360/2 = 180 geostationary C-band satellites or 360/1 = 360 geostationary Ku-band satellites. C-band transmission is susceptible to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference</b> while Ku-band transmission is affected by rain (as water is an excellent absorber of microwaves at this particular frequency).

With a few exceptions, any homeowner may install a satellite dish of a size of one meter or smaller in diameter (larger dishes are protected in Alaska). While HOAs may encourage that dishes be placed as inconspicuously as possible, the dish must be allowed to be placed where it may receive a usable signal. Additionally, many HOAs have restrictive covenants preventing a homeowner from installing an OTA (over-the-air) rooftop antenna. These restrictions are also no longer enforceable, except in some instances. For example: the antenna may be installed at any location unless it imposes upon common property. Also, the antenna must be of a design to receive local, not long-distance signals and must not extend any higher than twelve feet above the top roof-line of the home, unless an exception is granted by the HOA due to extenuating <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of integrated wireless sensor and multibeam satellite networks (IWSMSNs) under <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference.</b> The IWSMSNs constitute sensor nodes (SNs), satellite sinks (SSs), multibeam satellite and remote monitoring hosts (RMHs). The multibeam satellite covers multiple beams and multiple SSs in each beam. The SSs can be directly used as SNs to transmit sensing data to RMHs via the satellite, and {{they can also be}} used to collect the sensing data from other SNs to transmit to the RMHs. We propose the hybrid one-dimensional (1 D) and 2 D beam models including the equivalent intra-beam interference factor β from terrestrial communication networks (TCNs) and the equivalent inter-beam interference factor α from adjacent beams. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference</b> is possibly due to the signals from the TCNs or the signals of sinks being transmitted to other satellite networks. The closed-form approximations of capacity per beam are derived for the return link of IWSMSNs under <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference</b> by using the Haar approximations where the IWSMSNs experience the Rician fading channel. The optimal joint decoding capacity can be considered as the upper bound where all of the SSs’ signals can be jointly decoded by a super-receiver on board the multibeam satellite or a gateway station that knows all of the code books. While the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) capacity is where all of the signals of SSs are decoded singularly by a multibeam satellite or a gateway station. The simulations show that the optimal capacities are obviously higher than the MMSE capacities under the same conditions, while the capacities are lowered by Rician fading and converge as the Rician factor increases. α and β jointly affect {{the performance of}} hybrid 1 D and 2 D beam models, and the number of SSs also contributes different effects on the optimal capacity and MMSE capacity of the IWSMSNs...|$|E

40|$|Centimeter {{wavelength}} {{radio astronomy}} spans approximately {{two decades in}} frequency, from roughly 500 MHz to 50 GHz. In contrast, radio astronomy instruments have traditionally been limited to at most octave bandwidths, necessitating multiple instruments on a given telescope to cover a large fraction of the spectrum. This paradigm is infeasible {{for the next generation}} of telescopes, which will likely consist of hundreds to thousands of small dishes combined together in an array, because each receiver must be replicated for each element in the array. Therefore, wide bandwidth instrumentation must be developed for radio astronomy. This thesis presents a novel radio telescope with excellent system noise temperature and reasonable efficiency across an instantaneous fractional bandwidth greater than 4 : 1; amongst the widest ever demonstrated. This instrument illustrates that extremely wide bandwidth instruments are feasible, even in the presence of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference.</b> To make use of the enormous instantaneous bandwidth, a flexible, high performance, and cost effective digital signal processing system is also presented. Theory, design, and measurements of special purpose digital spectrometers built to minimize the effects of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>interference</b> are included. Aside from the practical advantages offered by wide bandwidth instrumentation, new scientific applications are also made possible. A special purpose system for performing detailed studies of giant radio pulses from rotating neutron stars (pulsars) is presented, along with demonstrations including some of the largest fractional bandwidth observations of these pulses made to date.
