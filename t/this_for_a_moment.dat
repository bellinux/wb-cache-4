If k sections are available, the measurements will be collected in a data matrix X having dimension m× k.

2500|$|After 1723, the {{situation}} seemed to stabilise, {{much to the}} delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of VOC’s military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that VOC’s plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II, this time without any serious resistance from anybody. The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch’s effort. In this relatively peaceful situation, the king could not gather the support of his [...] "subjects" [...] and instead was swayed by short-term ends siding with <b>this</b> faction <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and then to another. The king never seemed to lack challenges to his [...] "legitimacy".|$|R

Despite the background, you discern them. The process is partially intentional and partially preattentive. How all {{this can be done}} is described in the fourth volume of Models of Neural Networks devoted to Early Vision and Atten­ tion that you are holding in your hands. Early vision comprises the first stages of visual information processing. It is as such a scientific challenge whose clarification calls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> penetrating review. Here you see the result. The Heraeus Foundation (Hanau) is to be thanked for its support during the initial phase of this project. John Hertz, who has extensive experience in both computational and ex­ perimental neuroscience, provides in "Neurons, Networks, and Cognition" to neural modeling. John Van Opstal explains in a theoretical introduction "The Gaze Control System" how the eye's gaze control is performed and presents a novel theoretical description incorporating recent experimental results. We then turn to the relay stations thereafter, the lateral genicu­ late nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex. Their anatomy, phys­ iology, functional relations, and ensuing response properties are carefully analyzed by Klaus Funke et al. in "Integrating Anatomy and Physiology of the Primary Visual Pathway: From LGN to Cortex", one of the most comprehensive reviews that is available at the moment...|$|R

30|$|The optical {{properties}} of Si-NCs can be investigated {{by means of}} time-resolved spectroscopy. This method often brings new information about disorder in the ensembles of emitters, especially in complex systems where various collective phenomena result in complicated time dependence of the experimental PL decay. Particularly, {{in the case of}} Si-NCs different authors have shown [3, 4] that very often PL decay exhibits stretched exponential line shape. However, the physical origin of such behavior remains a matter of discussion. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> few explanations have been given by different authors, such as exciton migration between interconnected nanocrystals [5], variation of the atomic structure of Si-NCs of different sizes [6], carriers out tunneling from Si-NCs to distribution of nonradiative recombination traps [7] and many other [8, 9]. Therefore, it is still important to gather some new experimental evidence in this field.|$|R
40|$|Have {{you ever}} tried making a water clock from {{pieces of wood}} left over from renovation, a plastic spoon, a yogurt carton and {{bits and pieces of}} string? At the {{suggestion}} of their teacher, the first author constructed such a device — {{with the help of the}} directions in a junior science guide — and took it to the combined grade three and four class in which the two authors were collaborating in a study of the grade three students as they worked on the theme of time. When it was finally set up, the teacher asked some of the children who had been watching to demonstrate how it worked to the rest of the class. Unfortunately, it failed to work as expected. However, suggestions for fixing it were not slow in coming and soon an animated discussion was in full swing, as competing proposals were put forward, justified and evaluated.

40|$|Information Processing and Leadership: A Review and Implications for Application In {{the current}} paper, {{contemporary}} {{research that has}} examined the role of information processing {{in the context of}} leadership is reviewed and the implications of <b>this</b> research <b>for</b> application are discussed. Although {{the vast majority of the}} leadership literature has focused on external and observable outcomes, such as a leader’s behaviors, the current paper takes an alternative perspective, reviewing literature that has examined leadership from an information processing vantage point. In contemplating the utility of <b>this</b> perspective, consider <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the following questions: How does a subordinate decide whether his/her supervisor is a leader? Why does an organizational supervisor punish one subordinate for poor performance but not another? Why does a supervisor utilize a particular behavioral style? As the literature reviewed throughout this paper shall indicate, the answer to each of these questions lies in developing a better understanding of how leaders and subordinates process information. To provide an organizational framework, the present paper is divided into three main sections. In the first portion of this paper, a working definition of leadership and information processing are provided. Next, relevant literature dealing with a leader’s information processing is reviewed, and finally, relevant literature dealing with follower information processing is discussed. Defining Leadership and Information Processing As a starting point, leadership is conceptualized as a social process, one involving both...|$|R

40|$|In {{the city}} of Hargeisa, tax {{collectors}} and fiscal officers of the self-proclaimed and internationally unrecognized Republic of Somaliland exhibit a constant ambivalence as they perform their job, i. e., direct income taxation. While presuming the taxpayer's dishonesty, they rely on the anticipation of honesty to collect public revenue, although they could deploy state force to accomplish their task. Ethnographic material collected over six months of fieldwork is used in this paper to argue that this ambivalence and the hesitancy to use violence can be analytically construed as a ground from which a form of political obligation other than fear of state violence may eventually emerge. The tax collectors and I, based on literary theory, decided to speak about this ambivalence as "suspicion", <b>for</b> <b>this</b> feeling enables the awareness of unfolding time and thereby opens up a future horizon where the possibility of genuine adherence to the Somalilander project emerges. In this sense, the tax collector's suspicion in Hargeisa reflects the Somalilander quest to retrieve the proper foundations of its political authority. Taxes, thus, have a dual meaning: when imagined as debt, they construe collectors as {{the authority of the}} sovereign nation state; when imagined as a form of owing, they construe collectors as agents of a common collective project. The central point {{of this study is that}} this second path of the moral imagination could hold the promise of a distinct political future not rooted in coercion. <b>This</b> future flashes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the fiscal situation before the attentive observer...|$|R
40|$|In August of 2008 the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health {{concluded}} {{its work}} {{with the publication of}} a report entitled: “Closing the gap in a generation: Health equity through action on the social determinants of health. ” The Commission’s chair, Sir Michael Marmot, was kind enough to answer our questions about the Commission’s recommendations. This interview was conducted by email in May of this year. Social Medicine: We congratulate the Com-mission on its excellent work in bringing attention to the social determinants of health and the Commission’s call for health equity. We appreciated the Commission’s recognition that: “Social Justice is {{a matter of life and}} death. ” We were also happy that the Commission included representatives of civil society in their work. This was an important affirmation of democratic values. When thinking about health inequalities people often use the analogue of the ladder to show how the gradient of worsening health outcomes affects all people in society except (presumably) those at the very top. Thinking about the ladder leads us to pose the following question: Is making the ladder shorter (i. e. reducing inequalities) the only approach to inequalities or is it possible to imagine making the ladder disappear entirely? Sir Michael Marmot: All societies have hier-archies. It is not conceivable, therefore, to have a society with no ladder. The conceptual framework of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health leads us to think of at least two (linked) ways to address the relation between position on the ladder and health: act at the societal level to reduce social inequalities, and break the link between position in the social hierarchy and health. The first argues for reducing the slope of the social gradient. To see <b>this,</b> suppose, just <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> that the ladder were defined on the basis of years of education. People who had three years or fewer had life expectancy of 50 years, those who had 13 years or more had life expectancy of 80 and the rest were ranged in between in a graded way: the social gradient in health. Now if we had a societal change so that everyone had at least 10 years of education, and better health followed as a result, the magnitude of health inequity would be reduced. We have reduced inequities by making the ladder shorter. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and design of microwave ovens used in the food industry. Such analysis is desirable in order to optimize {{the performance of the}} ovens and to reduce the time and expenses of developing new or improved ovens. The initial electromagnetic analysis is performed using the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD) and it is shown that even relatively large installations, such as multi-applicator tunnel ovens, can be readily analyzed on inexpensive PCs. To enable thermal simulations, used to find the temperature distribution within the food products, a simple but efficient magnetron model is presented. Using this model the magnetron output power can be modelled as a function of e. g. the position of the food load within the oven or of permittivity changes in the food. The problem of process optimization is addressed and it is shown that due to the long computation times when using FDTD, more efficient analysis tool are required. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> method (MM) code, based on an integral equation formulation for multilayer structures, is presented <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific type of oven. This code is able to calculate the field distribution in a multilayer food load in less than a minute, which makes it possible to run hundreds of simulations in a reasonable time in search for the optimal oven design. To be able to classify the quality, or performance, of a specific oven the concept of cost functions is introduced. The cost functions assign a figure of merit to the field distribution within the oven, and serve as a measure of how close the field generated by the oven comes to the desired field distribution. We use two different cost functions, one that will produce a maximally uniform field, by minimizing the difference between the hottest and coldest part of the food, and one that will suppress the horizontal component of the electric field in order to minimize overheating of the edges of the food. Throughout this thesis, a reoccurring topic is that of edge overheating, i. e. the fact that sharp edges of high-permittivity food products often tend to be excessively heated when using microwaves. The edge overheating effect is analyzed in detail using the Multiple Multipole Program (MMP). We show that the main factors governing edge overheating are the polarization of the incident field, the curvature and angle of the edges, and the presence of other scatterers {{in the vicinity of the}} edge...|$|R
