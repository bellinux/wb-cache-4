5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades {{after the death of}} Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
