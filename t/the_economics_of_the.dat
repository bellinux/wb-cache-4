5|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining access to the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} {{need to apply}} costly techniques such as formal verification or manual review, {{the size of the}} TCB has immediate consequences on <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TCB assurance process, and the trustworthiness of the resulting product (in terms of the mathematical expectation of the number of bugs not found during the verification or review). In order to reduce costs and security risks, the TCB should therefore be kept as small as possible. This is a key argument in the debate preferring microkernels to monolithic kernels.|$|E
25|$|The common {{source of}} the C3 alkenes for the {{alkylation}} is made available from the gas recovery unit processing the effluents of the Fluid catalytic cracking Unit. Isobutane is partly made available from the Catalytic reforming and from the Atmospheric distillation, although {{the proportion of the}} isobutane produced in a refinery is rarely sufficient to run the unit at full capacity and additional isobutane needs therefore to be brought to the refinery. <b>The</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international and local market of gasolines dictates the spread that a buyer need to pay for isobutane compared to standard commercial butane.|$|E

The network expanded across the Pacific to Vancouver via Auckland, Nadi, Honolulu and San Francisco in early 1954 when it took over the Southern Cross Route of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA). The first of the airline's Lockheed 1049 Super Constellations was delivered in early 1954.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} real property, mechanic's liens are purely {{statutory}} devices {{that exist in}} every state (although in California, as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely {{the right to sue}} on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.|$|E
25|$|In the post-independence period, many {{efforts were}} made to {{regulate}} and support the horse racing industry in Ireland, and a greater effort was made to promote Irish horses internationally. As early as 1926, the Irish Free State legislated to allow off-course betting, and the Tote was introduced in 1930 to raise funds for the industry. The Emergency that accompanied the Second World War was reportedly beneficial to horse racing, as restrictions on foreign and motor travel led to an increase in spectator numbers. The Irish Racing Board, the predecessor to Horse Racing Ireland, was set up in 1945 to oversee <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industry, followed by the Irish Horse Authority in 1995 and Horse Racing Ireland in 2001.|$|E
25|$|The 4th-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus left a {{detailed}} record of some Greek influences and innovations in viticulture, {{one of which}} was the study of vineyard soils and their proper match to specific grapevines. Another innovation was the minimization of yields for more intense concentration of flavors and quality, rather than increased quantity. <b>The</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time favored high yields for most crops, and intentionally limiting agricultural output was exceedingly uncommon in the ancient world. Theophrastus also detailed the practice of using suckering and plant cuttings for new vineyard plantings. The Greeks also employed vine training with stacked plants for easier cultivation and harvesting, rather than let the grapevines grow untrained in bushes or up trees.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Deming was {{introduced}} to Walter A. Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the control chart, as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrialized world after 1950.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build {{as a replacement for}} some of the oldest icebreakers. Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state-owned fleet.|$|E
25|$|Motivated {{in part by}} a businessman's {{desire to}} {{quantify}} <b>the</b> <b>economics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choice, and in part by his scientific inquisitiveness, he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered Joule's first law in 1841, that the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences. He went on to realize that burning a pound of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of zinc consumed in an electric battery. Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise one pound, a height of one foot, the foot-pound.|$|E
