40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the reasons behind the considerable complications facing the project to develop a new, second generation version of the Schengen Information System (<b>SIS</b> <b>II).</b> Despite the centrality of this large-scale EU database for immigration and border control purposes and the increasing prioritisation of security technologies within the EU’s internal security strategy, the project has encountered substantial delays, an escalating budget, political crises and criticisms of the new system’s potential impact on fundamental rights. To uncover {{the underlying causes of}} these difficulties and deficiencies, the paper examines the decision-making processes that have shaped the development of <b>SIS</b> <b>II</b> over the last decade. It argues that there are strong parallels between the policy processes surrounding <b>SIS</b> <b>II</b> and decision-making under the old Schengen regime, where expert driven, security oriented and fragmented decision-making took place outside the EU framework and beyond the reach of democratic and judicial oversight. The paper contends that decision-making on <b>SIS</b> <b>II</b> undermines principles of proportionality, accountability and fundamental rights and, by extension, puts into question the political legitimacy of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations intended to inform the future development of large-scale EU IT systems. Research for this paper was conducted in the context of INEX, a three-year project on converging and conflicting ethical values in the internal/external security continuum in Europe. The project was funded by the Security Programme of DG Enterprise of th...|$|R

The letter called upon the current EU presidency and the Commission to come up with solutions to help overcome financial implications of the delay until entering the Schengen area by either considering the 2007-2013 financial instruments or establishing a special financial instrument for that purpose.” ...|$|R

40|$|The abolishment of the {{internal}} border checks and the common procedures at the external borders fosters the decision-making of the European Union to establish large-scale IT systems {{in the area of}} freedom, security and justice. The decrease of the security deficit by the control of immigration flow consists of three endeavours: the common border control policy, the common visa policy and the common asylum policy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse and evaluate the development of the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The development process of these systems is not more than their integration into the so-called IT Agency. This new regulatory agency was established in January 2012. It has merged the operational management tasks of the further developed version of <b>SIS</b> (the <b>SIS</b> <b>II),</b> VIS and EURODAC and it is flexible to add other existing and potential new systems. Hence, the added-value of the IT Agency is to be assessed, since new technologies shall be harnessed to meet the requirements of enhancing security and facilitating travel at the external borders...|$|R

Especially the intensity of U 73 +-beams could be slightly increased up to 6 x 10 9 ions per cycle. For several lighter ions (e. g. for Ar, <b>N)</b> <b>SIS</b> 18 has been operated close to the space charge limit. Figure 1 shows the maximum intensity per cycle achieved for highly charged ions with a charge state produced by stripping in the transfer channel. of the U 39 + beam was comparable with {{the intensity of the}} U 28 + beams. Thus, also for the U 39 +-beam the number of accelerated ions exceeded the level of 10 10 ions (see figure 2). However, the increased charge state enables acceleration to a higher final energy (350 MeV/u instead of 200 MeV/u) which is of particular interest for the running experimental program at GSI.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effects of bile and {{pancreatic}} juice on structural and mechanical resistance of extracellular matrices (ECMs) in vitro. METHODS: Small-intestinal submucosa (SIS), porcine dermal matrix (PDM), porcine pericardial matrix (PPM) and bovine pericardial matrix (BPM) were incubated in human bile and pancreatic juice in vitro. ECMs were examined by macroscopic observation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and testing of mechanical resistance. RESULTS: PDM dissolved within 4 d after exposure to bile or pancreatic juice. SIS, PPM and PDM retained their integrity for > 60 d when incubated in either digestive juice. The effect of bile {{was found to be}} far more detrimental to mechanical stability than pancreatic juice in all tested materials. In SIS, the loss of mechanical stability after incubation in either of the digestive secretions was less distinct than in PPM and BPM [mFmax 4. 01 / 14. 27 <b>N</b> (<b>SIS)</b> vs 2. 08 / 5. 23 N (PPM) vs 1. 48 / 7. 89 N (BPM) ]. In SIS, the extent of structural damage revealed by SEM was more evident in bile than in pancreatic juice. In PPM and BPM, structural damage was comparable in both media. CONCLUSION: PDM is less suitable for support of gastrointestinal healing. Besides SIS, PPM and BPM should also be evaluated experimentally for gastrointestinal indications...|$|R

40|$|An {{antagonistic}} {{relationship between}} epilepsy and psychosis has been claimed. On the other hand, abnormality of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens {{is thought to}} be involved in schizophrenia and temporal lobe epilepsy. In order to examine the role of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens in limbic seizure and psychosis, the following were studied: 1. Amygdaloid kindling and the functional change of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens, 2. Accumbens kindling, 3. Functional change of limbic nuclei following the accumbens kindling, and 4. The effects of lesioning of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens on <b>the</b> amygdaloid kindling. The results were as follows: 1. The amygdaloid kindling induced epileptic focus and positive transfer into <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens. 2. <b>The</b> kindling phenomenon was confirmed positive by repeated stimulation of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens. Clinicoelectrographic seizure development during <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens kindling resembled that of amygdaloid kindling. The mean minimum intensities to induce afterdischarge and kindling rate were 620 μA and 23 days, respectively. 3. Positive transfer was found in <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> amygdala and hippocampus following the accumbens kindling. 4. Lesioning of <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens had no effect on amygdaloid seizure development, but lowered the threshold intensity to induce amygdaloid afterdischarge after kindling. It was concluded that <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens and <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> amygdala formed epileptic hyperexcitability reciprocally and that <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> accumbens had an inhibitory effect on the limbic seizure, but no effect on the developed amygdaloid kindling...|$|R
