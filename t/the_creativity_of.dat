5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

5|$|Frank Womack's {{captaincy}} and <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie contributed much to Birmingham winning {{their second}} Division Two title in 1920–21. Womack {{went on to}} make 515 appearances, a club record for an outfielder, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old Joe Bradford, {{who went on to}} score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs {{to make up for the}} lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} <b>the</b> <b>creativities</b> <b>of</b> protest as {{phenomena of}} rhythm. Theoretically, I propose translating Cornelius Castoriadis’ regional ontology of selves into a problematique of rhythms. I argue for an artisanal way {{of using the}} Castoriadian conceptual pair autonomy/heteronomy, focusing on moments rather than on entire societies. Furthermore, I introduce a notion of concentricity of rhythms {{that allows us to}} capture the polyrhythmic complexity of protest situations, which become psychic situations, involving presences, as well as absences, half-absences or spectres. Thus, I aim to contribute to a psychosocial understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creativities</b> <b>of</b> collective action. Finally, I analyse the concentricities of rhythm in a site of protest in Romania. The organisation Alburnus Maior protests against the project of a gold mine based on cyanide technologies. It performs a complicated political choreography, centred on the symbolic pair gold-death. Listening to the rhythms of the square enables a reflection on autonomy, recognition and post-oedipal politics...|$|R

40|$|The broad {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{interdisciplinary}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between <b>creativity</b> and visualization. More specifically, the research engages with artistic, cultural, technical and scientific modes of recognizing and evaluating <b>creativity.</b> <b>The</b> thesis explores the potential for new visualization technologies to represent, communicate or interactively engage with theories <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> in order to extend our understanding <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and its application across differing domains. The research has been developed from two parallel but previously under-related discourses. The first informs a discussion of general problems in <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> across different domains, while the second focuses more on studies <b>of</b> artistic <b>creativity</b> using computer technologies. The thesis gives an overview of various creative theories and the neuroscience approach to creativity. It demonstrates that most studies on <b>creativity</b> focus on <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and measuring <b>creativity.</b> <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> includes where <b>the</b> creative thought is produced which involves consideration of individual, social and environmental factors. <b>The</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> focuses on evaluating <b>the</b> individual ability <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> <b>The</b> subject <b>of</b> much study on creativity is human and other elements related to <b>the</b> human ability <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> artistic <b>creativity</b> engaging with computer technologies {{in the form of}} case studies raise questions on how to understand the “machine’s creativity” and {{what is the role of}} the “machine as creator” in <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> This investigation <b>of</b> art practice engaging with technology indicates a contribution of the "machine as creator” to a new knowledge <b>of</b> <b>creativity.</b> <b>The</b> above analysis <b>of</b> the various definitions, theories and concepts <b>of</b> <b>creativity</b> and visualization indicates that there is a gap in a creative technology-based approach to <b>creativity.</b> <b>The</b> subsequent investigation <b>of</b> visualization technology indicates that the technology itself plays a key role in transforming or interpreting data into visual media for scientific findings.

25|$|Rijkaard has evidently {{learned to}} curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a {{portrait}} of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy {{in the media and}} is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team's play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard's commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team's 2004–05 and 2005–06 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4–3–3 formation, a system which encouraged <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks. Within this system, the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield, which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents' half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking.|$|E

25|$|Kovel {{highlights}} {{the fact that}} Marx mentioned the idea when he stated {{that human beings are}} no more than the planet’s “usufructaries, and, like boni patres familias, they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition”. Kovel has taken on this reading, asserting that, in an eco-socialist society, “everyone will have... rights of use and ownership over those means of production necessary to express <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> <b>of</b> human nature”, namely “a place of one’s own” to decorate to personal taste, some personal possessions, the body and its attendant sexual and reproductive rights. However, Kovel sees property as “self-contradictory” because individuals emerge “in a tissue of social relations” and “nested circles”, with the self at the centre and extended circles where “issues of sharing arise from early childhood on”. He believes that “the full self is enhanced more by giving than by taking” and that eco-socialism is realized when material possessions weigh “lightly” upon the self – thus restoration of use-value allows things to be taken “concretely and sensuously” but “lightly, since things are enjoyed for themselves and not as buttresses for a shaky ego”. This, for Kovel, reverses what Marxists see as the commodity fetishism and atomization of individuals (through the “unappeasable craving” for “having and excluding others from having”) under capitalism. Under eco-socialism, he therefore believes that enhancement of use-value will lead to differentiated ownership between the individual and the collective, where there are “distinct limits on the amount of property individuals control” and no-one can take control of resources that “would permit the alienation of means of production from another”. He then hopes that the “hubris” of the notion of “ownership of the planet” will be replaced with usufruct.|$|E
500|$|French {{world music}} {{magazine}} Mondomix has called Jaojoby {{the most popular}} singer in Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands.

Radio France Internationale described his vocal performance as [...] "clear, powerful and energetic ... his trademark, which makes him stand out in the Madagascan musical panorama".
