50|$|In {{mainstream}} economics, deflation may {{be caused}} by a combination of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for goods and <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> and demand for money, specifically <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> of money going down and <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> of goods going up. Historic episodes of deflation have often been associated with <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> of goods going up (due to increased productivity) without an increase in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> of money, or (as with the Great Depression and possibly Japan in the early 1990s) the demand for goods going down combined with a decrease in <b>the</b> money <b>supply.</b> Studies of <b>the</b> Great Depression by Ben Bernanke have indicated that, in response to decreased demand, the Federal Reserve of the time decreased <b>the</b> money <b>supply,</b> hence contributing to deflation.|$|R

5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off <b>the</b> <b>supplies</b> of raw cotton.

The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E

40|$|For any {{business}} to compete {{successfully in the}} modern, globalised business environment, it needs to mobilise its suppliers and customers to co-operate {{in order to reduce}} unnecessary costs and inefficiencies between them and to ensure the best value for the final customer. The focus is on management of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain as a whole (or a system) and maximum value for the final customer of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain, instead of on management for the maximum benefit of one of the parties in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain. If <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain is seen as a system of organisations with one aim (value for the final customer), it is logical that a problem in one part of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain must affect the workings and efficiency of <b>the</b> system or <b>supply</b> chain as a whole. This article reports on an exploratory empirical study to illustrate the effect of problems at one party in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain on <b>the</b> whole <b>supply</b> chain. <b>The</b> study was done at automotive component manufacturers. To determine how problems at one place permeate through <b>the</b> whole <b>supply</b> chain, correlation testing was done between supply-side, internal operations, and distribution or customer-side problems. The study found that problems experienced at one place in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain had a negative impact throughout <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Automotive supply chains should therefore be managed more as a system, taking into consideration the effect of decision making and actions at one part of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain on other parts of <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain. There should be a supply chain wide co-operative effort to find solutions to inefficiencies at all places in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain. </span...|$|R

The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E
