5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought <b>to</b> <b>entail.</b> Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E

25|$|By 1710, Lady Mary had two {{possible}} suitors to choose from: Edward Wortley Montagu and Clotworthy Skeffington. Lady Mary corresponded with Edward Wortley Montagu via letters from 28 March 1710 to 2 May 1711. After May 1711 {{there was a}} break in contact between Lady Mary and Edward Wortley Montagu. Mary's father, now Marquess of Dorchester, rejected Wortley Montagu as a prospect because he refused <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> his estate on a possible heir. Her father pressured her to marry Clotworthy Skeffington, heir to an Irish peerage. In order to avoid marriage to Skeffington, she eloped with Wortley. The marriage license is dated 17 August 1712, the marriage probably took place on 23 August 1712.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1936, Crosby {{exercised}} an option from Paramount {{to make a film}} out-of-house. Quickly signed to a one-picture agreement with Columbia, Crosby dreamt of having his icon and friend Louis Armstrong, an African-American, who largely influenced his singing style, in a screen adaptation of The Peacock Feather called Pennies from Heaven. Crosby talked to Harry Cohn about the matter, but he disagreed saying: [...] "...no reason <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> the expense of flying him in and having no desire to negotiate with Armstrong's crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, Joe Glaser." [...] Bing threatened to walk out on the film and refused to discuss it with Cohn. Armstrong's musical scenes, along with some comical dialogue as well, heightened his career. Bing also had it that Armstrong made high billing alongside his white co-stars, one of the first times ever for a black performer in a wide-audience film. He starred as himself in many more films to come and had a large appreciation for Bing's unracist views, often thanking him in his later years.|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of {{this line}} of {{reasoning}} follows several threads. [...] Some reject the argument on grounds relating to personal identity, holding that the fetus is not the same entity as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a [...] "future like ours" [...] in the required sense. Others grant that the fetus has a future like ours, but argue that being deprived of this future is not a significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus, because there are relatively few psychological connections (continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop. [...] Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing: as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> that some killings are far more wrong than others, or that some people have a far stronger right to life than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.|$|E
2500|$|Armenians {{had been}} {{inflamed}} {{by the sight}} and pitiful stories of several hundred thousand refugees who had succeeded in reaching Transcaucasia, fleeing before the Ottoman Army. Consequently, when the Russian Army broke up, the Armenians preserved their discipline against all attempts of the Bolsheviks, and were the only force upon which the Allies could count in southwestern Asia {{during the last year}} of the war. The two million Armenians of Transcaucasia, increased by several hundred thousand refugees from the Ottoman Empire, persisted in their loyalty to Russia until the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk delivered them to the Ottoman Empire. Then they moved to form their own state, which succeeded in maintaining itself during the period of anarchy and famine that Bolshevism brought upon the Russian Empire. At the Peace Conference, speaking before the Council of Ten, M. Aharonian, delegate of the Armenian Republic of the Caucasus, stated that the two and a half million Armenians in Transcaucasia wanted to cast in their fortunes with the Armenians of Ottoman Empire to form a Greater Armenia. According to Michael P. Croissant, the ARF set out to take revenge for the persecution and genocide suffered by Armenians {{at the hands of the}} Ottomans, while Tadeusz Swietochowski states that [...] "Armenian historians do not offer an explanation for the political calculations behind this move, which was bound <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> terrible retribution, and they hint rather at an uncontrollable emotional outburst".|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, William {{was forced}} <b>to</b> change the <b>entail</b> on his earldom. His only son, William, was a sickly lad, and the earl was well aware that if the boy died, leaving him without a male heir, the earldom would pass out of the Mactaggart family. To prevent this from coming to pass, he {{consulted}} with his sister Marjory, Countess of Caithness and Orkney, who consented <b>to</b> <b>entailing</b> the earldom <b>to</b> their half-brother, Hugh of Rarichies. This arrangement, which happened in 1350, would have had the effect of preserving the earldom in the Mactaggart family. Although young William was named in 1354 as one of the hostages for the king’s ransom, records show that by August 1357 he was quite ill and must have died soon after. Indeed, in 1357, young William died, but fourteen years later, King David, never fond of William for his earlier bad decisions, ripped the earldom out of the Mactaggart line.|$|R

2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash {{at the time that he}} gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said <b>to</b> <b>entail</b> the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E
