5000|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parents realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki.

Its clever, certainly, and must have been a labour of love, unpicking all these people from their works, weaving them into something else." [...] But he had a problem [...] "with the whole exercise - starting with the characters, someone elses, and then figuring out what <b>theyre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be doing. Are things not better if they grow together, as one, characters, stories, style, themes etc?

He concluded, [...] "And Im having real problems figuring out what the bleedin ell is going on. Its clear like the fog down by the dock where Fagin lives. It - the fog - does lift a bit; by the end of the second episode (of 20! that’s a big ask), Im a bit less fuddled. And it begins to pick up momentum of its own.

[...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki.

[...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. I think theres an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. <b>Theyre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want to see what happens next.
