500|$|These {{sequences}} {{were inspired}} by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series {{he was working on}} before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. [...] "I had just worked on a show on another network [...] we had a show where {{there were a lot of}} notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough. When recording the DVD commentary however, Jean said that he was a bit dissatisfied with the new ending. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> leave it a little hanging", he said.|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{a particularly good}} job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E

We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The ninth {{season of}} the show was {{produced}} by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Television. The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs." [...] Brent Forrester, who had been a consulting producer and writer since the third season was promoted to executive producer, alongside new series writer Dan Sterling.|$|E
500|$|The album's title Meddle is {{a play on}} words: a medal, and to interfere. [...] Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis {{originally}} {{suggested a}} close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. [...] He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have [...] "an ear underwater". [...] The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. [...] The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson has expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: [...] "I think Meddle {{is a much better}} album than its cover". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shares his sentiments, saying: [...] "Meddle was a mess. [...] I hated that cover. [...] I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted." [...] The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band (Floyd's last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason).|$|E

500|$|On May11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth {{season and}} it was later {{announced}} that Greg Daniels, {{who had been the}} series showrunner from season one through five, would be returning. [...] "New Guys" [...] was written and directed by Daniels. This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs.

500|$|The Bears entered their bye week {{in third}} in the {{division}} behind Green Bay and Detroit. The team was attempting {{to recover from the}} injuries suffered by seven players in the previous week against the Redskins. Jay Cutler and Lance Briggs were projected to be out for four weeks, while Brandon Marshall, Alshon Jeffery, Charles Tillman, Major Wright and Blake Costanzo, the other five players hurt, used the bye to heal. Marc Trestman preferred to use the week to rest his players, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a good thing by letting these guys rest. They came back with a lot of energy [...] There was very little rust in terms of executing and getting through the practice." [...] During Trestman's tenure with the Montreal Alouettes, the Alouettes were 5–4 (...) in games after bye weeks, and 3–1 (...) in the postseason after byes. At practice on October 28, rookie Khaseem Greene filled in for Briggs, and was expected to start against the Packers. Greene and fellow rookie Jon Bostic eventually started for the Bears against the Packers. Lorin Cox of Pro Football Central predicted the Bears would finish {{the second half of the}} season with a 4–5 record, and a final record of 8–8.|$|E
500|$|Lennertz {{recorded}} the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records. Lennertz attempted to remain [...] "authentic" [...] to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process." ...|$|E

500|$|Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain in 1994, {{and were}} convicted {{by a jury}} {{decision}} on July 28, 1995, for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty-nine witnesses, including former followers of Rajneesh who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, {{the former mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay Avalos (Ma Ava), a Rajneesh disciple, testified in the Croft case and stated that she {{had been part of the}} conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and Avalos, co-conspirators Richard Kevin Langford, Phyllis Caldwell, and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to conditional plea or immunity agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. Croft and Hagan did not testify during their trial. [...] "We hashed over everything – evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> an absolutely fabulous job," [...] said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan, the federal Judge Malcolm Marsh described them as [...] "people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system." [...] Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination [...] "a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system." [...] Croft and Hagan were released from imprisonment at FCI Dublin, California, in April 1998, and returned to Britain.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

We knew we were among the top there, but this has renewed our confidence for next year's World Cup." [...] The West Indian team received US$60,000 for being the runners-up. Lara said: [...] "not many expected us to reach the final but we showed we were good enough for that. I am happy the boys fought till the end, {{it was a very}} close game.

2500|$|McKellar {{attended}} {{a summer camp}} for the blind {{as part of his}} research. He wanted to observe how blind people interacted in groups. He discovered that excessive expositional dialogue, usually frowned upon by writers, was essential for the groups. McKellar cut one of the last lines in the novel from his screenplay: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> go blind, I think we are blind. Blind but seeing. Blind people who can see, but do not see." [...] McKellar believed viewers would by that point have already grasped the symbolism and didn't want the script to seem heavy-handed. He also toned down the visual cues in his screenplay, such as the [...] "brilliant milky whiteness" [...] of blindness described in the novel. McKellar knew he wanted a stylistically adept director and didn't want to be too prescriptive, preferring only to hint at an approach.|$|E
