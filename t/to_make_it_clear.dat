5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Intervention in Latin America {{had been}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision to send U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, {{for his role in}} the Haitian intervention. Once Harding was sworn in, Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921; U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty with Colombia, granting that nation $25,000,000 as settlement for the U.S.-provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> what the U.S. aims were.|$|E

5|$|After Becket's {{murder in}} December 1170 King Henry sent Barre to Rome, {{accompanied}} by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Évreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy. The mission's objective was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to Alexander that Henry had {{had nothing to do}} with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope. Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an interdict, or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king. Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a royal justice. He was named chancellor to King Henry's eldest living son Henry for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's seal.|$|E

The work, ostensibly a medical tract, draws on both Paracelsian alchemy and Böhmian mysticism.

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law.

25|$|On 15 September 1917, {{shortly after}} promulgating the 1917 code, Benedict XV promulgated the motu proprio Cum Iuris Canonici, which forbade the Roman Congregations from issuing new general decrees {{unless it was}} {{necessary}} to do so, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that they were elucidating particular canons of the code.

25|$|Pieces are {{arranged}} in this section so that, if they promote, they promote into the piece above them. Piece names with a grey background are present {{at the start of}} the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus a3K means a piece that can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus mKa3K means a piece that takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> what legs the a modifier chains together: thus DaK would denote a dabbaba move followed by a king move, but D would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.|$|E
