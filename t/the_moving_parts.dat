5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the engine}} units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser.

40|$|A numeral control micropositioning {{workpiece}} {{table is}} presented that is mainly {{made up of}} a <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a base, three piezoelectric translators, and three capacitive sensors. An elastic structure with three half-notch flexure hinges is used to generate preload for piezoelectric translators. With the aid of the FEM, the structural dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and flexure hinges is designed with the consideration of stiffness match between <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and <b>the</b> piezoelectric translators. Meanwhile, the position of flexure hinges is also chosen to reduce bending deformation of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and to enlarge external dimensions of the workpiece table. The theoretical algorithm of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> rotating about an arbitrary symmetric axis is developed. The experimental results illustrate that the workpiece table has a nature frequency of 584 Hz, an open loop control stiffness of 104 N/μm at the central point of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a closed loop control stiffness of 650 N/μm at work area of the table, a resolution of 6 nm and a positioning accuracy of 49 nm...|$|R

It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

50|$|In this {{interruption}} principle arc {{energy is}} used, {{on the one}} hand to generate the blast by thermal expansion and, on the other hand, to accelerate <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> circuit breaker when interrupting high currents. The overpressure produced by the arc energy downstream of the interruption zone is applied on an auxiliary piston linked with <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> resulting force accelerates <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> thus increasing <b>the</b> energy available for tripping. With this interrupting principle it is possible, during high-current interruptions, to increase by about 30% the tripping energy delivered by the operating mechanism and to maintain the opening speed independently of the current. It is obviously better suited to circuit breakers with high breaking currents, such as generator circuit breakers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} realize active {{grinding}} control, a nanometer micropositioning table is designed. The table has a circular working area with diameter of 150 mm. Three piezoelectric actuators are utilized in parallel to drive <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> with flexure guide mechanism. Through {{cooperation of the}} three piezoelectric actuators, <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> can implement 3 -DOF nanometer positioning. The flexure hinge mechanism can also provide preload for the actuators.

25|$|Sticking valves:The {{moving parts}} in {{first and second}} stages have fine {{tolerances}} in places, and some designs {{are more susceptible to}} contaminants causing friction between <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> this may increase cracking pressure, reduce flow rate, increase work of breathing or induce free-flow, depending on what part is affected.|$|E
25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal forces on <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> especially for sliding seals. Some designs avoid sliding surfaces altogether by using diaphragms for sealed pistons. These {{are some of}} the factors that allow Stirling engines to have lower maintenance requirements and longer life than internal-combustion engines.|$|E
25|$|A similar effect {{occurs with}} the second stage. Air which has already {{expanded}} and cooled through the first stage expands again and cools further at the demand valve of the second stage. This cools {{the components of the}} second stage and water in contact with them may freeze. Metal components around <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of the valve mechanism allow heat transfer from the surrounding slightly warmer water, and from exhaled air from the diver, which is considerably warmer than the surroundings.|$|E

25|$|Inlet filter blockage: The inlet to the {{cylinder}} valve may {{be protected by}} a sintered filter, and the inlet to the first stage is usually protected by a filter, both to prevent corrosion products or other contaminants in {{the cylinder}} from getting into the fine toleranced gaps in <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the first and}} second stage and jamming them, either open or closed. If enough dirt gets into these filters they themselves can be blocked sufficiently to reduce performance, but are unlikely to result in a total or sudden catastrophic failure.|$|E
25|$|While {{outwardly}} {{very similar}} to the armet, the close helmet had an entirely different method of opening. Like the armet, the close helmet followed the contours {{of the head and neck}} closely, and narrowed at the throat, therefore it required a mechanical method for opening and closing. While an armet opened laterally using two large hinged cheekpieces, a close helmet instead opened vertically via an integral rotating bevor, which was attached to the same pivots as its visor. <b>The</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> were usually secured when closed by pivot-hooks engaging pierced staples. Alternatively, spring-loaded studs could be employed. The bevor was often held closed by a strap.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of {{the speaker}} must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

25|$|Freezing: In cold {{conditions}} the cooling effect of gas expanding through a valve orifice may cool either {{first or second}} stage sufficiently to cause ice to form. External icing may lock up the spring and exposed moving parts of first or second stage, and freezing of moisture in the air may cause icing on internal surfaces. Either may cause <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of the affected stage to jam open or closed. If the valve freezes closed, it will usually defrost quite rapidly and start working again, and may freeze open soon after. Freezing open {{is more of a}} problem, as the valve will then free-flow and cool further in a positive feedback loop, which can normally only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve and waiting for the ice to thaw. If not stopped, the cylinder will rapidly be emptied.|$|E
25|$|The Model 1910 fires from {{a locked}} breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a {{rearward}} position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will {{rise from the}} frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system wasn't strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9×19 Parabellum caliber.

25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of upstream pressure on <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of the valve so that a change in supply pressure does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and unbalanced piston first stages are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in supply pressure from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in interstage pressure, even with an unbalanced first stage. However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in supply pressure. Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|E

The main problems associated with the Holcroft gear included inadequate lubrication of <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> and the whipping of the conjugation levers connecting the inside cylinder to the outside motion while running at high speeds, which caused uneven steam distribution to the cylinders.

The sharks were designed by art director Joe Alves during {{the third quarter of}} 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper's Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location.
