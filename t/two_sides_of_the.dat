5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E

The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions.

5|$|Nesomys narindaensis {{is known}} from a damaged skull, missing {{part of the}} back, a {{mandible}} (lower jaw) with the first two molars (m1 and m2), and four isolated molars (one first upper molar, M1, one third upper molar, M3, and two m2). It is larger than {{each of the three}} living species, and the known material additionally differs from those in a few details that may not hold in larger samples. Total skull length is 61.3mm, longer than in the largest living species, N.lambertoni (50.3–53.8mm). The width of the palate between the M1 is 8.7mm (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni) and the length of the upper toothrow is 9.04 and 9.16mm on the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni).|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance Football Club, {{founded in}} 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green {{district}} of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, to a field in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enclosure adjoined farmland.|$|E

5|$|Survey markers were {{erected in}} Lloydminster to demark the Saskatchewan–Alberta {{boundary}}. Lloydminster {{is one of}} two Canadian cities on a provincial boundary and the gateway to Alberta. It currently ranks in size as the 89th largest city in Canada. The <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city rank 10th in Alberta and 11th in Saskatchewan in municipal population. If the city were entirely in one province or the other, Lloydminster's population would rank ninth in Alberta and fifth in Saskatchewan. It is renowned for its booming petroleum industry and the OTS Heavy Oil Science Centre. The highway is surveyed north of the Battle River and south of the North Saskatchewan River. Marshall is the first town southeast of Lloydminster with 533 residents is also the hometown of NHL Goaltender, Braden Holtby. Lashburn, a town of 967 in 2011 maintains the Lashburn Municipal Campground.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. The <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, {{and it is still}} used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route. This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E

5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a new roadway was opened, {{completing}} the third {{side of a}} triangle between the junction with M-113, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. US131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle became part of M-113 and M-186. A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. US131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi. Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast, {{from the end of}} the previous new routing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a Bypass US131 was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged. A decade later, mainline US131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former bypass route, and Business US131 (Bus. US131) was created for the former route through downtown. A second business loop was created in Three Rivers, Michigan, after an expressway bypass of the city's downtown was opened in early 1954. Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the M-32 junction west of Elmira in late 1956.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line will create a loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced all the old stock. By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E
