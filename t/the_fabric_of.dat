5|$|Muchelney Abbey is an English Heritage {{property}} {{in the village of}} Muchelney in the Somerset Levels, England. The site consists of ruined walls showing the layout of the abbey buildings constructed from the 7th to 16th and the remaining intact Abbott's House. It is next to the parish church in which some of <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the abbey has been reused.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} {{was designed}} by Robert Potter and Richard Hare, while the associate architect in charge was JJA Caount. Potter was based in Salisbury and was better known as an ecclesiastical architect, having previously designed the (now listed) Church of the Ascension in Crownhill, Plymouth and St George's Church in Oakdale, Dorset. During his lifetime he was also responsible for significant work on Chichester Cathedral, Chelmsford Cathedral, Oxford's Bodleian Library and he held the post of Surveyor to <b>the</b> <b>Fabric</b> <b>of</b> St Paul's Cathedral in London.|$|E

5|$|As of 2005, the {{building}} still retained {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> {{the building}} remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that the building was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. The building, once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished {{in the spring of}} 2008. The pair of stone piers in the forecourt of the building, which were Grade II listed in 1998, remain.|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the College of Arms. Although it {{had survived the}} Blitz, structural problems with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> a {{building}} {{have been discovered}} in many European countries, {{as well as in}} other parts of the world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the building and thieves had stolen the lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|From 1691 until around 1860 {{there had}} been no choir at the cathedral. There was also no organ for some time. Browne Willis' 1719 account {{describes}} the ruins of an organ given to the cathedral by Lady Kemysh of Cefn Mably found in the organ loft at that time. In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, Some Account of the Condition of <b>the</b> <b>Fabric</b> <b>of</b> Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral's choir and to purchase a new organ.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the building was in poor repair. A major stonework fall from the north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, {{the representation of the}} emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E

5|$|The orb {{itself was}} buried {{deep in the}} ground for {{millions}} of years, until it was discovered by Karnath, an evil sorcerer. Upon finding the orb, Karnath fused it into his own magical staff, and on doing so learned {{the history of the}} Sarnathians. He became obsessed with the orb and the task of releasing these beings from the Realm of Unreality. After years of isolation in his castle, as his own death was drawing near, Karnath was finally able to cast a powerful spell over his staff. This spell was designed such that upon contact with the orb, it would unleash its most powerful state and tear <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> reality once more.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{traces of}} <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} clas church. Most {{buildings in the}} sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
