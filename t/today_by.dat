5|$|Carbon was {{discovered}} in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls {{built around}} Bronze Age settlements. The Phoenicians, Romans and Byzantines built {{a number of}} defensive walls around important settlements, but very little remains of these survive <b>today.</b> <b>By</b> the late medieval period, the main fortifications on Malta were the capital Mdina, the Cittadella on Gozo, the Castrum Maris and a few coastal towers or lookout posts.|$|E

5|$|Abundant {{evidence}} for the domestication of guinea pigs has been found at Tequendama and Aguazuque where the small rodents formed part of the diet of the people, who consumed mainly white-tailed deer, hunted on the plains surrounding the various lakes and rivers. The diet was greatly expanded when early agriculture was introduced, possibly influenced by migrations from the south; present-day Peru. The main cultivated product was maize in various forms and colours, while tubers formed a significant {{other part of the}} food source. The fertile soils of especially the Bogotá savanna proved advantageous for the development of this agriculture, still evidenced <b>today</b> <b>by</b> the widespread farmfields outside the Colombian capital.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron {{took part}} in the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily and the Italian campaign, primarily in the close support role. Its aircraft attacked targets in Yugoslavia as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to North American P-51 Mustang fighters in May 1945, but never saw action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. <b>Today,</b> <b>by</b> agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a Royal Canadian Air Force unit, 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Ball {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular manga series of all time, and it {{continues}} to enjoy high readership <b>today.</b> <b>By</b> 2000, more than 126 million copies of its tankōbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone. By 2016, this number had grown to pass 156 million in Japan and 240 million worldwide, making it the second best-selling Weekly Shōnen Jump manga of all time. Dragon Ball is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted Dragon Ball the third greatest manga of all time.|$|E
5|$|Exit {{numbers were}} {{originally}} sequential but are assigned <b>today</b> <b>by</b> mileage from south to east, the same numbering system {{used by the}} majority of U.S. states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of Interstate 70 (I-70) east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.|$|E
5|$|From there, {{the story}} becomes more complex. Apparently, the {{skeleton}} was {{scattered throughout the}} quarry, with the remains being recovered from September 1879 to September 1880. Marsh elected to place some of the material in a new species, C. agilis, {{on the strength of}} a pair of fused pubic bones he thought belonged to an animal {{three times the size of}} C. fragilis. He returned to the genus in 1888 to add C". gracilis, based on unknown remains only represented <b>today</b> <b>by</b> a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland. This species is not currently accepted as representing Coelurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus.|$|E

5|$|In 1608 Sir Hugh Pollard {{was named}} as chief {{forester}} {{in a suit}} brought before the Court of Exchequer by his deputy William Pincombe. James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, was named as Keeper of Exmoor Forest in 1660 and 1661. James Boevey was a forester in the 17th century. Sir Richard Acland (or possibly Sir Thomas Dyke Acland) was the last forester up to 1818. One of {{the roles of the}} Warden was Master of Staghounds and this role continued to be exercised by the Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, a position extant <b>today.</b> <b>By</b> 1820 the royal forest had been divided up. A quarter of the forest, , was sold to John Knight (1765–1850) in 1818. This section comprises the present Exmoor Parish, whose parish church is situated in Simonsbath.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era (considered to be from 1901 to <b>today</b> <b>by</b> MLB, {{as it was the}} first season with both of the current Major Leagues in operation), four Australians have played in postseason games, all of them pitchers. Graeme Lloyd became the first, playing with the New York Yankees in 1996. He made {{appearances}} against the Texas Rangers in the League Division Series, the Baltimore Orioles in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Lloyd was credited with the win in game4 of the 1996 World Series, becoming the first Australian player to do so, as well as becoming the first Australian to be a World Series champion when the Yankees won in 1996 and again in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law <b>today.</b> <b>By</b> 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E

5|$|Over 95% of Ashdod's {{population}} is Jewish; over 30% {{of whom are}} religiously observant.

About 100 families are affiliated with the Pittsburg Hasidic group, established here in 1969 by Grand Rabbi Avraham Abba Leifer and continued <b>today</b> <b>by</b> his son, Grand Rabbi Mordechai Yissachar Ber Leifer. Ashdod has many synagogues serving different streams of Judaism. The city is also home to the world's largest Karaite community, about five thousand strong.

Rhodes continued to teach the piano through his lifetime, and the piano method continues to be taught <b>today</b> <b>by</b> {{a team led by}} Joseph Brandsetter.|$|E
