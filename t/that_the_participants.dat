5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem. He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E
25|$|Eva Kärve and Leif Elinder {{were denied}} access by Gothenburg University.

25|$|After Kyanka {{lost his}} match, {{he would go}} on to make several false {{allegations}} against Boll, including a claim that Boll refused to fight against Chance Minter who was an experienced amateur boxer. However, Boll fought Minter as his fourth opponent. He also alleged that Boll had misled them by claiming that it was a PR stunt when he actually intended to fight them, and that Boll stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> would get training before the match, which none did.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{a process}} of {{informed}} consent {{is often used to}} make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June 1996, the {{administrative}} head of Kadar was murdered. The villagers blamed local Wahhabists, and the suspects fled to Chechnya. The incident escalated {{the tensions between}} the traditional Muslims and Djamaat's Wahhabists. On 12 May 1997, an armed conflict involving more than 450 gunmen erupted between the traditionalists and the Wahhabists at a funeral in Chabanmakhi. The Wahhabists had demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> pray toward Mecca instead of toward the coffin, which was in violation of traditional practices. 2 people died until the firing stopped, possibly due to a rumour that an army of Wahhabists were about to arrive from Chechnya as reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|During his {{lifetime}} Polwhele {{was seen as}} a minor figure, though prolific, and after his death he was little read. The contemporary reader may find some of Polwhele's preoccupations, particularly botany and fashion, amusing. The Unsex'd Females, however, was a salvo in a propaganda war <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> took extremely seriously. After the revolution in literary criticism in the 1970s and 1980s when it was successfully argued that works could not solely be judged on their literary merit, poems such as Polwhele's were resurrected. They have subsequently shed considerable light on the cultural moments during which they were written. The Unsex'd Females remains of considerable interest today as a vibrant example of the politically charged culture of the revolutionary period in Britain.|$|E
25|$|A second interpretation, that Nash {{referred}} to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: ``t is unnecessary to assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. What is assumed {{is that there is}} a population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ``average member of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. For a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, The Work of John Nash in Game Theory, Journal of Economic Theory, 69, 153-185.|$|E
25|$|Stouten (2006) further {{generalized}} {{the principle}} of fairness {{to be applied to}} the provision of public goods. He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the free rider problem and an under-provision of public goods.|$|E

30|$|For this research, new PEP {{scores were}} developed, {{which are the}} scores of {{distortion}} of emotional perception. For {{each of the eight}} emotions, when <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> identified its presence in the video, one point was added to the total amount of that emotion. Thus, we obtained eight final scores indicating the total amount of each emotion. At the end, we subtracted from each score the actual frequency of each emotion in the PEP. For example, a resulting score of − 2 for anger indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> identified two expressions of anger less than what is truly present in the test; a score of five for anger indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> identified five more emotions of anger than what is present in the test.|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to decrease the}} amount of days <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> went without washing her dishes. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> would let her dishes pile up for days leading to unsanitary situations. For example, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> would not soak her {{dishes in the sink}} when she was done eating or cooking she would simply just set it on the counter. This would lead to whatever leftover food that was left on the plate to be caked on and take a long amount of time to wash off. Therefore, the study used ABAC design to help {{to reduce the number of}} days <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> would let her dishes pile up for. After observing the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and realizing <b>that</b> this was a behavior that needed to be changed, the researcher made the behavior apparent to <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and she volunteered herself for the study. Through the use of two different interventions, in an attempt to reach the goal of only having the duration of one day of letting her dishes pile up. The two different interventions included a stimulus intervention, which included having pictures of what her kitchen looked like when it was clean up on the cupboards. The second intervention included the pictures as well as verbal prompting to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> behavior was to be performed. The outcome of <b>the</b> study showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> was able to reduce the duration of the amount of days between washing dishes...|$|R
25|$|Critics of the BCS National Championship {{argued against}} the {{internal}} validity of a so-called national championship being {{awarded to the}} winner of a single postseason game. Critics lamented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were selected based upon polls, computer rankings, popularity and human biases, and not by on-field competition, as in other major sports and all other levels of college football, which employed tournament-format championships. Often, the BCS system led to controversies in which multiple teams finished the season with identical records, and voters distinguished the worthiness of {{their participation in the}} BCS National Championship with no set of formal criteria or standards. The end of the 2010 season {{was one of the best}} examples of this. Without any objective criteria for evaluation of the teams, the BCS forced voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics noted that the system inherently fostered selection bias, and therefore lacked both internal validity and external validity.|$|E
500|$|In his experiment, {{subjects}} rated {{a set of}} 50 quotations on a 5-point {{scale of}} [...] "agreement" [...] or [...] "disagreement" [...] with the statement.

After about a month, the subjects again rated the same quotation but with the true author only listed below the quotation. Subjects also rated earlier their [...] "respect for the political opinions of each of these individuals". This was used as a measure of prestige. [...] Lorge found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> rated the same statement differently when it was referred to a different author. More specifically, the rating of a statement tended to rise when it was referred to a more [...] "prestigious" [...] author.|$|E

Other formerly critical organisations have since said that they will accept the outcome of the vote and now wish to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the News of the World for invasion of privacy.
