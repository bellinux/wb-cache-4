5|$|A major {{development}} of <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> {{the appearance of}} stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E

5|$|During their {{relatively}} short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered {{in an era}} of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} {{the last years of}} the 18th century that the area {{developed}} from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge. The town's development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the industrial revolution, and in particular with the hot blast process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and in <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland' and the 'Iron Burgh'.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three {{different}} sub periods: MBII A, B, and C.

5|$|The Maya {{developed}} their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when {{this era of}} Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> characterized by sedentary communities {{and the introduction of}} pottery and fired clay figurines.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{economy of}} <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>was</b> {{dominated}} by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade.

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{north of}} Taegu on September 11 {{in the vicinity}} of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused.
