40|$|Global change factors affect plant carbon uptake in concert. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the response directions and potential interactive effects, and to understand the underlying mechanisms, multifactor experiments are needed. The focus {{of this study was}} on the photosynthetic response to elevated CO 2 [CO 2; free air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) ], drought (D; water-excluding curtains), and night-time warming (T; infrared-reflective curtains) in a <b>temperate</b> <b>heath.</b> A/Ci curves were measured, allowing analysis of light-saturated net photosynthesis (Pn), light- and CO 2 -saturated net photosynthesis (Pmax), stomatal conductance (gs), the maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), and the maximal rate of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration (Jmax) along with leaf δ 13 C, and carbon and nitrogen concentration on a monthly basis in the grass Deschampsia flexuosa. Seasonal drought reduced Pn via gs, but severe (experimental) drought decreased Pn via a reduction in photosynthetic capacity (Pmax, Jmax, and Vcmax). The effects were completely reversed by rewetting and stimulated Pn via photosynthetic capacity stimulation. Warming increased early and late season Pn via higher Pmax and Jmax. Elevated CO 2 did not decrease gs, but stimulated Pn via increased Ci. The T×CO 2 synergistically increased plant carbon uptake via photosynthetic capacity up-regulation in early season and by better access to water after rewetting. The effects of the combination of drought and elevated CO 2 depended on soil water availability, with additive effects when the soil water content was low and D×CO 2 synergistic stimulation of Pn after rewetting. The photosynthetic responses appeared to be highly influenced by growth pattern. The grass has opportunistic water consumption, and a biphasic growth pattern allowing for leaf dieback at low soil water availability followed by rapid re-growth of active leaves when rewetted and possibly a large resource allocation capability mediated by the rhizome. This growth characteristic allowed for the photosynthetic capacity up-regulations that mediated the T×CO 2 and D×CO 2 synergistic effects on photosynthesis. These are clearly advantageous characteristics when exposed to climate changes. In conclusion, after 1 year of experimentation, the limitations by low soil water availability and stimulation in early and late season by warming clearly structure and interact with the photosynthetic response to elevated CO 2 in this grassland species...|$|E

40|$|<b>Temperate</b> <b>heaths</b> have an {{unfavorable}} conservation status in most European biogeographical regions. Increasing nitrogen levels promote competitive grass {{species such as}} Molinia caerulea, which is a main threat to heathland conservation in Europe. This article investigates the long-term influence of sod cutting and the resulting changes in soil properties on the heath composition, integrity, and structure. In 15 nature reserves across the northern half of Belgium, we used (1) {{a large number of}} plots (203); (2) a broad range of sod cut depths (2 – 40 cm), and (3) a temporal dimension that describes how long the effects of sod cutting persist (census up to 19 years after sod cutting). Multivariate analyses were used in order to explore the influence of sod cut depth and time after sod cutting on the soil and vegetation properties. There was a positive relationship between sod cut depth and soil pH and water level, and a negative relationship with Al 3 +, NH 4 +, and total organic matter (TOM). However, {{only a limited number of}} typical (target) species appeared after sod cutting, and then only weakly. Most of the time they remained a minor component of the restored vegetation. Moreover, M. caerulea reappeared and its cover significantly increased during the years following sod cutting. Although we were able to show that sod cut depth has a differential effect on soil properties and vegetation recovery, it also appeared that sod cutting does not restore wet heaths in the long term when applied in regions with high nitrogen deposition.

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) affect both atmospheric processes and ecological interactions. Our primary aim was to differentiate between BVOC emissions from above- and belowground plant parts and heath soil outside the growing season. The second aim was to assess emissions from herbivory, mimicked by cutting the plants. Mesocosms from a <b>temperate</b> Deschampsia flexuosa-dominated <b>heath</b> ecosystem and a subarctic mixed heath ecosystem were either left intact, the aboveground vegetation was cut, or all plant parts (including roots) were removed. For 3 - 5 weeks, BVOC emissions were measured in growth chambers by an enclosure method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. CO 2 exchange, soil microbial biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations were also analyzed. Vegetation cutting increased BVOC emissions by more than 20 -fold, and the induced compounds were mainly eight-carbon compounds and sesquiterpenes. In the Deschampsia heath, the overall low BVOC emissions originated mainly from soil. In the mixed heath, root and soil emissions were negligible. Net BVOC emissions from roots and soil of these well-drained heaths do not significantly contribute to ecosystem emissions, at least outside the growing season. If insect outbreaks become more frequent with climate change, ecosystem BVOC emissions will periodically increase due to herbivory...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} tropospheric ozone (O 3) pollution levels on methane (CH 4) emissions from peatlands, and their underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, we exposed peatland mesocosms from a <b>temperate</b> wet <b>heath</b> {{dominated by the}} sedge Schoenus nigricans and Sphagnum papillosum to four O 3 treatments in open-top chambers for 2. 5 years, to investigate the O 3 impacts on CH 4 emissions and the processes that underpin these responses. Summer CH 4 emissions, were significantly reduced, by 27 % over the experiment, due to summer daytime (8 h day− 1) O 3 exposure to non-filtered air (NFA) plus 35 ppb O 3, but were not significantly affected by year-round, 24 h day− 1, exposure to NFA plus 10 ppb or NFA plus 25 ppb O 3. There {{was no evidence that}} the reduced CH 4 emissions in response to elevated summer O 3 exposure were caused by reduced plant-derived carbon availability below-ground, because we found no significant effect of high summer O 3 exposure on root biomass, pore water dissolved organic carbon concentrations or the contribution of recent photosynthate to CH 4 emissions. Our CH 4 production potential and CH 4 oxidation potential measurements in the different O 3 treatments could also not explain the observed CH 4 emission responses to O 3. However, pore water ammonium concentrations at 20 cm depth were consistently reduced during the experiment by elevated summer O 3 exposure, and strong positive correlations were observed between CH 4 emission and pore water ammonium concentration at three peat depths over the 2. 5 -year study. Our results therefore imply that elevated regional O 3 exposures in summer, but not the small increases in northern hemisphere annual mean background O 3 concentrations predicted over this century, may lead to reduced CH 4 emissions from temperate peatlands as a consequence of reductions in soil inorganic nitrogen affecting methanogenic and/or methanotrophic activity...|$|R
40|$|Post-print del artículo publicado en Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. Versión revisada y corregidaCheirolophus uliginosus {{is a rare}} species, {{endemic to}} the {{south-western}} Iberian Peninsula, and listed as a characteristic taxon from the <b>temperate</b> Atlantic wet <b>heaths,</b> a priority habitat for conservation by the European Union. The conservation status of this species in most of its distribution area is poorly known, but, in recent times, some populations have disappeared {{and there has been}} a reduction in the number of individuals in others. In this context, we analysed the effects of population size on genetic diversity, revealing that genetic erosion and inbreeding depression could be having a significant impact on smaller populations. Furthermore, we studied the patterns of genetic structure and variability at the species level, finding a strikingly low within-population diversity and high among-population genetic differentiation. Finally, the genetic structure analyses suggested a long and complex phylogeographical history of C. uliginosus in the region, in agreement with the climate relict status proposed for this species.
