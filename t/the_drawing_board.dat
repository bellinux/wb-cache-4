5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, the 747X {{family was}} unable to garner enough {{interest}} to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept. Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X {{did not make it}} beyond <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.|$|E
5|$|Once the Stuka {{became too}} {{vulnerable}} to fighter opposition on all fronts, {{work was done}} to develop a replacement. None of the dedicated close-support designs on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> progressed far due {{to the impact of}} the war and technological difficulties. So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version. The Fw 190F started to replace the Ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the Ju 87 continued {{to be used as a}} night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.|$|E

50|$|Years before Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril {{opened on}} July 30, 1993, an Indiana Jones themed {{attraction}} {{had been on}} <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards,</b> but due to Euro Disney Resort's ongoing financial difficulties, the attraction was retooled.|$|R
50|$|Gordon was {{involved}} in the controversy over naming the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, after its founding in Montreal. Quebec nationalists wanted it called Château Maisonneuve in honour of Montreal's founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve. Gordon decided it should be named for Queen Elizabeth II, who had unexpectedly come to the throne in 1952 while the hotel was still on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
5|$|The S-IVB orbital {{workshop}} was {{the only}} one of these plans to make it off <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b> Dubbed Skylab, it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} until 1982 before serious {{consideration}} {{was given to}} any expressway plan. While most of the planned 1963 routes had vanished from <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> a north–south link through the Red Hill Valley Creek and an east–west route along the brow of the escarpment remained in place. An environmental assessment of both links began and was approved in 1985. However, expressway opponents launched {{an appeal to the}} provincial cabinet. This appeal was rejected in 1987, and engineering began. Preliminary designs were submitted to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth and approved in April 1990. Construction began immediately on structures to carry three routes (two road and one rail) over the future Red Hill Valley Parkway.|$|E
50|$|Screaming Jets is a 11-minute 1951 Canadian {{documentary}} film, {{made by the}} National Film Board of Canada (NFB) as part of {{the postwar}} Canada Carries On series. The film, directed by Jack Olsen and produced by Sydney Newman, depicted the contemporary Canadian and international aircraft in production and on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards.</b> <b>The</b> film's French version title is Avions à réaction.|$|R
50|$|The Plymouth Society of Chicago {{selected}} {{a committee to}} investigate the irrigated Payette River Valley in the five-year-old state of Idaho, and another site in Colorado, to be purchased for the colony. The present city of New Plymouth was on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> in Chicago, designed as a town able to be self-reliant {{through the use of}} irrigation, solidly built on an agricultural and railroad economy.|$|R
50|$|The next {{restaurant}} {{opened in}} Merrillville, Indiana. By May 1974, two more were on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards,</b> for Matteson and Homewood. Within five years, Kovacs hoped to open Archie's restaurants throughout {{the states of}} Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. However, the two existing locations were badly mismanaged, which prompted Archie Comics to close them down and buy the stock back from BarKo.|$|R
5|$|Nansen was now {{considered}} an oracle by all would-be explorers {{of the north}} and south polar regions. Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian Adrien de Gerlache, each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic. Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer Carsten Borchgrevink (whom he considered a fraud), he gave advice to Robert Falcon Scott on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901–04 Discovery Expedition. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got further than <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zieliński {{left the}} company, and Kiciński headed the project. Although the game's {{development}} continued, the demo was abandoned. According to CD Projekt, the development team had different {{ideas for the}} game and lacked overall direction; as a result, it was returned to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> in 2003. The team, unfamiliar with video-game development, spent nearly two years organising production. They received assistance from BioWare, who helped promote the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to Jade Empire. BioWare also licensed their Aurora game engine to the company.|$|E
50|$|A {{proposed}} F2H-3P photo-reconnaissance variant {{was canceled}} before reaching production. Unlike many other early jet fighters, no two-seat version was ever produced. A proposal {{to increase the}} aircraft’s speed by adding afterburners was canceled after a test aircraft suffered extensive damage to the wing roots and tail structure when the afterburners were actuated. A much faster swept-wing version of the Banshee was canceled before it left <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bob Osborn {{founded a}} slick {{quarterly}} magazine devoted solely to freestyle BMX. In {{the summer of}} 1984, Freestylin' Magazine made its debut. The BMX world suddenly noticed the sport's massive potential. Manufacturers hurried to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> to develop new freestyle bikes, components, and accessories, and began searching for talented riders to sponsor. Bike shops began stocking freestyle products. The AFA began to put on organized flatland and quarter-pipe competitions.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the bottom}} of the {{digitizer}} was a template with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large digitizer, which looked much like <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> common at <b>the</b> time. To aid the process of aclimatistion, the digitizer was used with an electronic pen, which made placing components both quick and accurate.|$|R
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no further than <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. Faced {{with the prospect of}} a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b> Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1933, {{the company}} was back in profit with $5.75 million working capital and 224 new Studebaker dealers. With the {{substantial}} aid of Lehman Brothers, full refinancing and reorganization was achieved on March 9, 1935. A new car was put on <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> under chief engineer Delmar [...] "Barney" [...] Roos—the Champion. Its final styling was designed by Virgil Exner and Raymond Loewy.

Yoshi came in one size and four colors, with different powers and huge appetites. Super Mario World arrived in 1991 alongside the Super NES in North America.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{proposed}} redevelopment project {{was sent back}} to <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> in April 2010 when the California Coastal Commission rejected it. A major issue was the disappearance from the plan of an originally proposed 79000 sq ft grassy park. In the plan rejected by the Coastal Commission, the park had been replaced by a smaller, hardscape plaza. The Port will now amend its master plan and resubmit its proposal for Coastal Commission approval - a process that can take several years.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{the early}} {{designers}} were such famous sailors as Uffa Fox and Jack Holt, although most successful boats were from <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> of local designers, {{the most prolific}} being Herbert Woods, Walter Woods, H.T.

Initially gaff rigs were the norm, but as the class entered the 1930s Punt owners adopted Bermuda rigs.|$|R
