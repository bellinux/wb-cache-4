50|$|Whether a {{language}} has primarily prepositions or postpositions {{is seen as}} an aspect of its <b>typological</b> <b>classification,</b> and tends to correlate with other properties related to head directionality. Since an adposition is regarded as the head of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-branching), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as verbs that follow their objects; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as verbs that precede their objects. This is only a tendency, however; an example of {{a language}} that behaves differently is Latin, which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn some {{international}} organizations {{and in many}} countries there have been obvious problems such as an unclear goal, ambiguous concepts, lack of theoretical framework and overlapping extensions in the classification of heritage, particularly in the classification of cultural heritage, and newly proposed <b>typological</b> <b>classifications</b> have even worsened the existing contradictions.

It is therefore necessary to re-categorize heritages according to their nature and functions, protection methods, management and exhibition requirements dictated by their different nature. In this paper, taking the authoritative “Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage” as example, we analyze the classification issues currently prevailing in heritage circles, state four principles which heritage classification should follow and put forward preliminary thoughts for the classification of heritages. At the same time, by an analysis of currently popular classifications, such as “cultural landscape”, we put forward new definitions of World Heritage categories, and the position it is proposed they take in the overall classification system...|$|R

50|$|Above all, {{whether the}} <b>typological</b> <b>classification,</b> {{function}} or technology, {{there is a}} premise in these analytic method. The premise is that archaeologists presume a blueprint of the end-product of stone tool, or say a mental map with step-by-step processes of prehistoric people in mind. This assumption contain the concept that people tend to shape stone tool into certain specific form for specific purpose. This {{is the foundation of}} lithic typology and widely accepted. However Hiscock (2004) provides an ethnographic observation from Australia and points out that the processes of making lithic flake are actually more social dynamic and with lots of negotiation between lithic knappers, the common measure attributes, such as retouched scar, form of flake and optimal economic presumption, are all less relate to the function of the end-product. Although there are several other ethnographic studies lead to similar conclusion, Hiscock reminds that these observations are not to overthrow the classification system now but to provide an alternative possibility to consider lithic study. Shott proposed that the settlement mobility and lithic technology are related based on ethnographic and archaeological studies. The technological diversity decreases when the mobility frequency and magnitude become greater, which is consistent with theoretically derived expectations from 14 ethnographic groups. Though diversity decreases, however, the range in the tool's flexibility in function greatly increases. As a result, the tool limit a group can carry can be determined by their mobility. Interestingly enough, foragers need only two to three different tool classes in order to survive.|$|E
40|$|MANY sociologists are {{attempting}} to apply sociology to the solution of numerous problem areas. Today one finds applied sociologists doing extensive research on such deviant behaviour as criminality, juvenile delinquency, mental illness, alcoholism, suicide, marriage and family maladjustments, and racial and ethnic discrimination. An increasing number of sociologists, for example, are even on the research staffs of correctional institutions, psychiatric departments, mental hospitals, and alcoholic treatment centres in the United States. Out of this applied and other sociological research come a number of sociological theories and concepts which appear useful. These concepts include the relation of deviant behaviour to social norms, sub-cultures and social groups, class structure, role theory and self-conceptions, <b>typological</b> <b>classifications</b> and urbanism. Social Norms A major interest of sociologists {{is the definition of}} the norms in-volved and the differences in society's tolerance of various types of norm violations. All deviations from social norms are by no means always disapproved. Inventions, for example, represent violations of norms which may be strongly approved. Other violations may be tolerated, and still others may be mildly disapproved. Deviant behaviour consists of those violations of norms which are of a sufficient degree to exceed the general tolerance limit of a society (Clinard, 1957). This means, of course, that the norms which constitute deviant behaviour are not necessarily the same in various cultures, nor are they the same in a given culture over a period of time.

40|$|Archaeologists seek {{to analyze}} {{patterns}} of similarity and difference among diverse kinds of assemblages that (1) vary {{in the number}} of specimens and (2) have been characterized by standard multi-category frequency distributions. Recent developments in computer simulation methods offer marked improvements in our ability to test statistical hypotheses about variation in relative taxonomic or typological abundance data, drawn from assemblages of variable sizes and diverse archaeological contexts (American Antiquity 66 (2001) 715; Journal of Archaeological Science 30 (2003) 837). In this article we extend the highly flexible and powerful computationally intensive framework for statistical analysis to the multivariate family of methods of analysis of variation (MANOVA) and non-hierarchical cluster analysis. We treat the relative type-frequency distribution as a multivariate quantitative description of the archaeological assemblage. We then introduce two simulation-based computer applications for analyzing variability between groups of assemblages. We utilize the multivariate applications in a case study; we evaluate how standard microlith <b>typological</b> <b>classifications</b> perform in capturing information about technological and formal variability among Early Epipaleolithic microlith assemblages from the Southern Levant. Computationally intensive, simulation-based statistical techniques allow the researcher to custom-tailor the measure of statistical variation and the model of random archaeological record formation relevant to the given problem. We suggest that with simulation-based approaches, the costs of computer programming and processing are far outweighed by the potential for explaining quantifiable variability in material traces of human activity in the past.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} account of polar questions in Italian dialects from a typological, theoretical and empirical perspective. Both data from the existing literature and new data from the author’s fieldwork are included in this study. It is shown that Italian dialects display a relatively large number of typologically diverse yes/no question-marking strategies, as opposed to Standard Italian and Romance. The variation found in Italian dialects is surprising, given that they are closely related from a typological point of view. Furthermore, Several Tuscan, Central and Southern Italian dialects display a specific construction that poses a challenge for standard <b>typological</b> <b>classifications</b> of polar questions in the world’s languages. A theoretical analysis is proposed in order {{to account for the}} syntactic properties of this yes/no question-marking strategy. Although this construction includes two fully-inflected verbs, it is argued that it should be analyzed as a monoclausal utterance. A number of syntactic tests are developed to shed some light on its underlying structure. Further evidence for the proposed analysis comes from the results of empirical testing. A production experiment was carried out to investigate the phonetic realization of this construction. The results of the experiment show that this constructions patterns with specific phonetic cues, which unambiguously signal its monoclausal status. This study is of relevance to anyone interested in descriptive typology, theoretical syntax and experimental phonetics, as well as Italian dialectology. Promotores: R. A. G. D'Alessandro, V. J. J.

However, neither Norwegian nor Russian is strictly an S-language in the understanding of Talmy. Moreover, they are not absolutely similar due to their specific features of motion encoding.

To test this hypothesis, native Russian speakers were asked to translate 30 sentences from Russian to Norwegian. The test results tend to confirm our hypothesis. </p...|$|E

40|$|It is now {{well-known}} {{from several}} studies that there exist {{different types of}} re-use in which the discriminating factor is that of visibility or less of the spolia and, {{in the case of}} visibility, when it also transmits the intention of showing off ancient elements as vehicles to transmit meanings. The history of these studies is vast and was set in motion by Deichman’s, Esch’s, Brilliant’s and Settis’s works. In the last few years all this has led to a significant international Colloquy on Reimpiego in architettura (Reuse in Architecture) which took place in Rome in 2008. This has set up a time space to re-think about the thematic on spolia and has re-introduced methodological aspects which underline the architectonic language and the image as a research instrument which passes over <b>typological</b> <b>classifications,</b> on the one hand, and traditional reading of architectonic spaces which have gone beyond the components of the elevations on the other. In this contribution we want to speak about two particular cases, i. e. the Basilica of Crapolla on the Sorrentine Peninsula and the bell tower of Pietrasanta in Naples. Because of their understanding {{as a result of the}} state they are in at present − the building of Crapolla is quite completely lost, only the bell tower survives in the case of the Pietrasanta complex − it is necessary to have recourse to a research methodology which takes advantage of the traditional instruments of the "material culture" of classification of the surviving architectonic elements. However the research must be integrated also with instruments which can be read semantically. In fact the architectonic language can be transmitted to the buildings' user as he possesses a “sense of the ancient” which allows the architectonic signs to be recognized as suitable in the space with which he interacts. In this sense, the architectonic spoils take on a fundamental role which passes over the utility or only aesthetic motivations which led to their choice...|$|R
40|$|This MA {{thesis is}} a study into the {{assemblage}} of bone tools from the Late Neolithic period of Tell Sabi Abyad, specifically the tools that come from the Operation III area. Only those objects {{that can be seen}} as tools or implements {{have been the subject of}} the research. In total this amounts to an assemblage of 1081 objects. Of these objects this study investigates which types are present, the numbers in which they occur, and the manner of distribution across the area. 	The first step is the forming of a typology that is easy to understand for anyone working with the bone tool material from Tell Sabi Abyad yet retains enough detail to make clear distinctions in the distribution of the different objects. The framework of the typology is based on several different ways in which researchers have looked at bone tool assemblages; from the very detailed work of J. Schibler to the more basic idea of expedient versus time-invested tools as first proposed by A. T. Clason. A quantitative analysis is then given, where the different <b>typological</b> <b>classifications</b> and the arguments underlying them are mentioned in detail. 	Secondly, the implement distribution and contexts per typological entity is investigated. This results in the identification of what can be seen as two main centres within the distribution of the Operation III area. Whether these can be counted as centres of activity is not certain. The available data on the contexts gives an ambiguous view and specific activity localities could not be recognized. 	From the study it becomes clear that Tell Sabi Abyad shows an assemblage comparable to other Neolithic sites in the Near East and other regions. The typology as it is set up fits well within the limits of the typologies of other sites and, as such, is recognizable for those working on similar studies. This counts both for Tell Sabi Abyad as for other sites. Future work will in all likelihood give rise to reasons for alteration of the current typology but it is believed that the main body will remain upright...|$|R
