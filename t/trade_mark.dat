5|$|Pirlo {{curled in}} a free-kick to seal a 2–0 defeat of Parma {{on the opening}} day of the new Serie A season. The goal caused much controversy, as the Parma players protested that it had not gone over the line, and replays proved inconclusive. In the {{following}} league match against Udinese on 2 September, Pirlo helped to win a penalty and assisted Sebastian Giovinco's second goal of the match, as Juventus went on to defeat the home side 4–1. On 29 September, Pirlo opened the scoring when he dispatched a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> free kick to send Juventus {{on their way to a}} 4–1 defeat of Roma. Pirlo was nominated for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, along with Juventus and Italy teammate Gianluigi Buffon, following their performances throughout the calendar year. Pirlo provided three assists for Juventus during the Group Stage, helping them to top their group undefeated and advance to the knockout stages for first time since the 2008–09 tournament. Pirlo was also elected the 2012 Serie A Footballer of the Year, as well as the best midfielder of the season, also winning the 2012 Guerin d'Oro. He was named as part of the 2012 Serie A team of the Year for his performances. Pirlo also won the Pallone Azzurro, given to the best player of the year in the Italian National Team, as well as placing fourth in the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker of the Year Award, and seventh in the FIFA Ballon d'Or. Pirlo and Juventus retained their Serie A title that season. Juventus were, however, eliminated by Bayern Munich in the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League, and in the semi finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio; both of these teams were the winners of these respective competitions.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{former members}} Graham Oliver and Steven Dawson {{registered}} 'Saxon' as a <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> They then maintained {{that they had}} exclusive rights to the name and tried to prevent Biff Byford and Saxon's promoters and merchandisers from using the name. Byford applied to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Registry to have the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> declared invalid. He applied {{on the basis that}} the registration had been obtained in bad faith and that he was entitled to prevent use of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> by bringing an action for 'passing off', that is an action to stop others misrepresenting themselves as Saxon. In 2003, the High Court declared that it was Byford and the current members of the band who owned the name, and were therefore in a position to prevent Oliver and Dawson passing themselves off as Saxon. After this Oliver and Dawson renamed their band Oliver/Dawson Saxon.|$|E

50|$|The Supreme Court, {{through a}} bench {{comprising}} Justices Ruma Pal and P. Venkatarama Reddi, {{set aside the}} decision of the High Court, and ruled in favour of Satyam Infoway.

The court stated that though there is no law in India which explicitly governs the regime of domain names, this state of affairs does not foreclose protection for domain names {{under the aegis of the}} <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. Thus, the court determined that domain names are protected under the law relating to passing off as delineated in the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act.|$|R

50|$|While the {{decision}} was appreciated for the finality it introduced in respect of the law regulating domain name disputes, it was also criticized by some in the legal circles for failing to notice the significant distinctions between <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and domain names.

Further, it is also believed that even the Information Technology Act, 2000, has failed to fill in the lacunae in the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act with respect to domain names.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} arrive at the Holding, the Supreme Court analogized domain names to <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> After an {{elaboration}} of sections 2(zb), 2(m), and 2(z), the court stated that a domain name in the contemporary era has evolved from a mere business address to a business identifier. Therefore, a domain name is not merely a portal for internet navigation, but also an instrument which distinguishes and identifies the goods or services of the business, while simultaneously providing the specific internet location. This feature of domain names in the modern era allows them to be likened to <b>trade</b> <b>marks,</b> and concomitantly to be included within the purview of the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act.|$|R
