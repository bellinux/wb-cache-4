5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

40|$|Metronidazole (MTZ) has {{negative}} effects on sperm analysis and testis structure. Curcumin is the principal curcuminoid found in turmeric and exhibits antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infectious activities with low toxicity. To evaluate stereological changes of seminiferous germinal epithelium by MTZ and ameliorative effects of curcumin, Balb-c mice were divided into 6 groups. The control, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth groups were administrated distilled water, high doses of MTZ (500 mg/kg/day), MTZ (500 mg/kg/day) þ 100 mg/kg/d curcumin, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of MTZ (165 mg/kg/day), MTZ (165 mg/kg/day) þ 100 mg/kg/day curcumin, and 100 mg/kg/day curcumin, respectively. Testis weight, testis volume, total epithelial volume, spermatocytes, and spermatid number showed {{a significant reduction in}} MTZ-treated (high or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses)</b> animals in comparison with the controls. Curcumin can protect spermatocytes after high or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of MTZ treatment. But curcumin is able to protect the other parameters only in the mice receiving <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of MTZ. The total number of sertoli cells and spermatogonia did not show any significant difference in the mice that received MTZ. It can be concluded that, MTZ can reduce germinal epithelium volume and the number of spermatocytes and spermatids. Ameliorative effects of curcumin can mainly be observed in the mice receiving <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of MTZ...|$|R

25|$|Diazepam was {{detected}} in 26% {{of cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite nordazepam {{was detected}} in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> range, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone. In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> {{dependence}} is {{the largest}} category of people dependent on benzodiazepines. These individuals typically do not escalate their doses to high levels or abuse their medication. Smaller groups include patients escalating their dosage to higher levels and drug misusers as well.

Tolerance develops within days or weeks to the anticonvulsant, hypnotic muscle relaxant and after 4 months {{there is little evidence}} that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Some authors, however, disagree and feel that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Long-term benzodiazepine treatment may remain necessary in certain clinical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Platelets {{are either}} {{isolated}} from collected units of whole blood and pooled {{to make a}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose,</b> or collected by platelet apheresis: blood is taken from the donor, passed through a device which removes the platelets, and the remainder is returned to the donor in a closed loop.

40|$|Abstract: Present {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} hepatotoxicity of nimesulide by single dose and seven days administration in sub therapeutic, therapeutic and supra <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> in litters of rat. Single dose and seven days administration hepatotoxicity studies of nimesulide were carried out in litters of rat of either sex. They were further subdivided into sub therapeutic (20 mg/kg), therapeutic (30 mg/kg) and supra therapeutic (100 mg/kg) groups. Effect of nimesulide on liver functions were analysed by serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and histopathological examination of liver through scoring system. Histopathological changes in liver were observed in therapeutic and supra <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> in single dose groups and sub therapeutic, therapeutic and supra <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> in seven days groups. In single dose of nimesulide in litters, there were significant increases in biochemical parameters (p< 0. 05) in supratherapeutic doses. However, in seven days studies of nimesulide in litters, there were significant increases in biochemical parameters (p< 0. 05) in <b>therapeutic</b> and supratherapeutic <b>doses.</b> The present study indicates that nimesulide causes significant hepatotoxicity in litters of rat...|$|R
25|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterized by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines {{and the development of}} the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremors, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal symptoms tend to develop within 24 hours upon cessation of short-acting benzodiazepines, and 3–10 days after cessation of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Withdrawal effects could occur after treatment, lasting only 2 weeks at <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> levels; however, withdrawal effects tend to occur with habitual use beyond 2 weeks and are more likely the higher the dose. The withdrawal symptoms may appear to be similar to the original condition.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{and other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs are detected frequently {{in cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.|$|E
25|$|Pooled {{whole-blood}} platelets, {{sometimes called}} “random” platelets, {{are separated by}} one of two methods. In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what {{is referred to as}} a “soft spin.” At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the “buffy coat” layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The “buffy coat” is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired <b>therapeutic</b> <b>dose.</b>|$|E
40|$|Drug–drug {{interaction}} between esomeprazole at <b>therapeutic</b> and higher <b>doses</b> and sulfonylureas was studied. Sulfonylureas (tolbutamide 40 mg/kg and glibenclamide 40 µg/kg) were administered {{and the time}} to onset of hypoglycemia, {{the duration of the}} hypoglycemia, and the peak hypoglycemia were determined. Esomeprazole (1. 8 mg/kg, 3. 6 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg) was administered for 8 days and its influence on sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia was studied. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>doses</b> of esomeprazole, i. e., 1. 8 mg/kg and 3. 6 mg/kg dose did not influence the hypoglycemia induced by sulfonylureas. However, a higher dose, i. e., 30 mg/kg, did significantly enhance the duration of hypoglycemia and the peak hypolgycemia. Esomeprazole (30 mg/kg) by itself did not reduce the blood glucose levels; therefore, a pharmacodynamic type of drug interaction can be ruled out. Similarly, a pharmacokinetic type of drug interaction may be ruled out at <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses.</b> The CYP isoenzyme system involved in the metabolism of sulfonylureas are not very sensitive to esomeprazole and the dose and frequency of administration of sulfonylurea need not be readjusted when they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole (at <b>therapeutic</b> <b>doses)</b> ...|$|R
