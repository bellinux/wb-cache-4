60|$|When I {{changed my}} dress last night (<b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> very quickly), I was vexed {{to find you}} gone. I wanted to have secured you for our green-room supper, which was very pleasant. If by any {{accident}} you should be free next Wednesday night (our last), pray come to that green-room supper. It would give me cordial {{pleasure to have you}} there.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{speak as}} <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for my pleasure," [...] says he. [...] "But I {{have a child}} now; and, besides, I love order; and to say the honest truth, Mackellar, I had begun to take a pride in the estates." [...] He gloomed for a moment. [...] "But what would you have?" [...] he went on. [...] "Nothing is mine, nothing. This day's news has knocked the bottom out of my life. I have only the name and the shadow of things - only the shadow; there is no {{substance}} in my rights." ...|$|E
60|$|As to one matter, I {{made up my}} mind on that day, and I fully {{carried out}} my purpose on the next: I would go across to the Well of Moses in a boat. I would visit the coasts of Asia. And I would ride back into Africa on a camel. <b>Though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> alone, I would have my day's pleasuring. I had money in my pocket, and, though it might cost me 20 pounds, I would see all that my namesake had seen. It did cost me the best part of 20 pounds; and as for the pleasuring, I cannot say much for it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't be distressed,' said Eugene, very, very kindly. 'I {{hope it is}} not I {{who have}} distressed you. I meant no more than to put the matter in its true light before you; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{acknowledge}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> selfishly enough, for I am disappointed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{cling to}} each other, {{let the world}} call us what names it may. But there may come {{a time in which}} one is called on to do a special act of justice to others. It has come now to me. From the world at large I am prepared, if possible, to keep my secret, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by lying;--but to this one man I am driven to tell it, because I may not return his {{friendship}} by doing him an evil." ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. But it's so sordid, dearest. I hate money. I cant keep always {{bothering you}} for money, money, money. Thats what drives me {{sometimes}} to ask other people, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> hate <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{were so much}} {{pleased with}} each other that we sat until a late hour. I insisted on paying the bill, for both my purse and my heart were full; and I agreed that he should pay the score at our next meeting. As the coaches had all gone that run between Hempstead and London he had to return on foot, He was so delighted {{with the idea of}} my poem that he could talk of nothing else. He made me repeat such {{passages}} as I could remember, and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in a very mangled manner, having a wretched memory, yet he was in raptures.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems they}} had been checked, for their open {{insulting}} religion in this manner, by several good people of every persuasion; and that[121] and the violent raging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion that they had abated much of their rudeness for some time before, and were only roused by the spirit of ribaldry and atheism at the clamor which was made when the gentleman was first brought in there, and perhaps were agitated by the same devil when I took upon me to reprove them; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> at first with all the calmness, temper, and good manners that I could, which, for a while, they insulted me the more for, thinking {{it had been in}} fear of their resentment, though afterwards they found the contrary.[122] ...|$|E
60|$|That night, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not realize}} <b>it,</b> my journey into a Far Country was begun.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a handy {{child and}} {{a credit to}} your {{bringing}} up, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> say <b>it.</b> Those are as pretty pies as I'd wish to eat, if they bake well, and there's no reason why they shouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} of finding a husband for {{the girl in the}} 55th, or any other regiment, I can promise you, brother; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think <b>it</b> getting to be time that the child were respectably married." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. Well, {{she walked}} {{backwards}} along a taut wire without a balancing pole and turned a somersault in the middle. I remember {{that her name}} was Lina, and that the other name was foreign; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> recollect <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She laughed softly. [...] "Women have {{no future}} {{and they ask}} none. At least <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not now, <b>though</b> once <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>It</b> is enough for them if they can ever so little help the lives of others. That is their happiness, and their reward is--rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor man,' murmured Paula. 'He was my father's architect, {{and somehow}} expected, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not promise <b>it,</b> {{the work of}} {{rebuilding}} the castle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Bertie,' {{interposed}} his mother, 'I'll {{not have}} you teasing and running down your sister, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> say <b>it</b> {{is a shame}} and a slight {{to pick out the}} youngest, when poor Ida is so delicate, and both of you two have ever so much better a right to favours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I daresay I am very old-fashioned; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{hope you}} won't begin using that expression, Clara. I have got {{accustomed}} {{to hear you}} talking about men as rotters, and calling everything filthy and beastly; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think <b>it</b> horrible and unladylike. But this last is really too much. Don't you think so, Colonel Pickering? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However, Harry seems {{delighted with}} it, and says it's {{beautiful}} soft, and mellow. But {{what he means}} <b>I</b> don't know, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> allow <b>it</b> ain't so squeaky as the other; and sometimes when Harry is playing soft on <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> sound beautiful. Still, thirty-eight shillings is a big price for an old thing like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{preparation}} {{they find}} beneficial at sea, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>it</b> would suit your case," [...] he said, and Oliviera roused {{himself to a}} further effort.|$|R
60|$|All {{that you}} so earnestly {{say about the}} {{goodwill}} and devotion of all engaged, I perceived and deeply felt last night. It moved me {{even more than the}} demonstration itself, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> suppose <b>it</b> was the most brilliant ever seen. When I got up to speak, but for taking a desperate hold of myself, I should have lost my sight and voice and sat down again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't say as he may {{not have}} had a bit of a stick, your honour, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not notice <b>it,</b> his hands being in his pockets; anyhow, he did not try to use it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost fancy I {{have met}} you somewhere, Miss Wheelock, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>it</b> was in Vancouver," [...] she said. [...] "Toronto is rather {{a long way}} off--but I wonder whether you were ever there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|That month sped fast away, {{and their}} drives were now last {{visits to the}} places that had charmed them at first. Their work was {{prepared}} for Mr. Fotheringham's inspection, and Violet having copied out her favourite passages of Helen's book, returned it on the last evening. 'I don't think I half understand all she says, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> admire <b>it</b> so much, and wish I was like it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad to {{hear that}} you think so clearly on this point, captain, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know <b>it</b> before. It is another bond between us. However, if I have been wrong in supposing you to be rich, I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, as she {{clapped her}} face to a window of the coach, [...] "if this isn't a reg'lar old-fashioned snow-storm! I've shoveled my own way through many a one like it to git to the barn to do my milkin' afore the men folks had begun makin' paths, an' I feel jus' like as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ag'in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The spider {{had no idea}} {{of attacking}} you, Kelly," [...] Peters said, laughing. [...] "It might {{possibly}} bite you in the night, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>it</b> would <b>do</b> so; or if you took it up in your fingers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'No, that I can't. I {{went out}} {{shopping}} soon after that. When I came {{in it was}} twelve o'clock. I {{went up to the}} third floor and found that Mr. Skinner had locked his door and taken the key with him. As I knew Mary had already <b>done,</b> the room <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not trouble more about <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think <b>it</b> strange for a gentleman to look up his room and not leave the key with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, I forced myself to tell him (<b>though</b> <b>I</b> could not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> distinctly), that <b>I</b> had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] said Herbert; [...] "but {{after all}} it is only what my {{ordination}} vows mean, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see <b>it</b> then. And this year must be a penance year; I had {{made up my mind}} to that before I fell ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|The reader, {{learned in}} these matters, will {{perceive}} {{that all this}} was but a faint shadow of the once gay and fanciful rites of May. The peasantry have lost the proper feeling for these rites, and have grown almost as strange to them as the boom of La Mancha were to the customs of chivalry, {{in the days of}} the valorous Don Quixote. Indeed, I considered it a proof of the discretion with which the Squire rides his hobby, that he had not pushed the thing any farther, nor attempted to revive many obsolete usages of the day, which, in the present matter-of-fact times, would appear affected and absurd. <b>I</b> must say, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> under the rose, the general brawl in which this festival had nearly terminated, has made me doubt whether these rural customs of the good old times were always so very loving and innocent as we are apt to fancy them; and whether the peasantry in those times were really so Arcadian, as they have been fondly represented. I begin to fear-- ...|$|R
60|$|Sir ANTHONY Well, Jack, I {{am glad to}} see you, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not expect}} <b>it,</b> for I was going to write to you on a little matter of business.--Jack, I have been {{considering}} that I grow old and infirm, and shall probably not trouble you long.|$|R
6000|$|... "That may {{all very}} well be," [...] <b>I</b> assented, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not believe <b>it,</b> and I found {{something}} almost too fantastical in my friend's scheme. [...] "But when we are expropriated from all our dearest belongings, what is to become of our tender and sacred associations with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did; but I {{thought you had}} forgotten, and I hardly knew how to remind you, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wished to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> But {{would you like to}} go? It is a cold night, and as Fanny is come, there is no necessity----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I know of one {{who will}} suit you admirably. He is common enough to look at, and if you will {{accompany}} me into the mine to-morrow I'll introduce you to him. I'm not fond of descending the ladders nowadays, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> very well when a youth, but as the man I speak of works {{in one of the}} levels near the surface, I'll be glad to go down with you, and Captain Dan shall lead us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Enclosed {{in my own}} four walls, I {{found myself}} as an {{immigrant}} imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want <b>it,</b> they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{by a long}} way. However, {{we shall}} {{be able to look}} forward to the spring, Bertha, when I shall have you all to myself on board, and we shall go on a long cruise together; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think that <b>it</b> is ridiculous that I should have to wait until then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{at first}} {{could not believe}} that God should speak by me to the heart of any man, still {{counting}} myself unworthy; yet those who were thus touched would love me, and have a particular respect for me; and <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> put <b>it</b> from me that they should be awakened by me, still they would confess it, and affirm it before the saints of God. They would also bless God for me, unworthy wretch that I am! and count me God's instrument that showed to them the way of salvation.|$|R
