5|$|In 1938, the Federación Salvadoreña de Fútbol became {{affiliates}} of FIFA. Once {{again the}} El Salvador national football team {{participated in the}} 1938 Central American and Caribbean Games, hosted in Panama, which were won by Mexico with Costa Rica in second place. El Salvador won two games and lost three out of the five played. A match for third place between Colombia and El Salvador was scheduled but was cancelled due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> physical state of the players. El Salvador finished in fourth place by goal difference.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> {{weather and}} dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal {{and prepared to}} bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|The first studio scene—Donna in {{the fortune}} teller's room—was filmed on 30 November 2007, on a redressed Torchwood Hub {{set at the}} show's Upper Boat Studios. The outdoor scenes in Shan Shen—comprising Tennant's entire {{contribution}} to the episode—were filmed on 1 December 2007 in Splott and near the Cardiff Royal Infirmary. The shoot was marred by difficulties: rain delayed redressing the alley from the hanzi banners and posters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Wolf versions; and several extras left at lunchtime because of a misunderstanding over their payment. The final scene filmed on the day was the Doctor's examination of the Time Beetle in the fortune teller's room. The scenes in the country hotel were filmed at Egerton Grey Country House Hotel in Porthkerry on 3 December 2007.|$|E

5|$|Though {{hampered}} {{by the need to}} work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> kick, Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of the situation. On the first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who hauled in the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of threeyards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 203 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
