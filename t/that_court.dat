5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when <b>that</b> <b>court</b> upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, <b>that</b> <b>Court</b> ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T.

5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting <b>that</b> <b>court</b> jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E

5|$|By 1969, WMATA {{had decided}} on the current routing and stations, except for the {{extension}} beyond Rockville to Shady Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending the Red Line in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion {{in the area and}} use scarce vacant land for a storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend the red line one more station to Shady Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975. Construction on the Red Line began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that the Red Line tunnel under that valley, the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. The Red Line was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and <b>that</b> <b>court</b> case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges.

He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but <b>that</b> <b>court</b> refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E

40|$|Recognizing <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> will {{eventually}} have to confront the issue of medical futility, this Comment argues {{that there is no}} principled basis for omitting these difficult questions from a legal analysis of the issue and <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> should therefore decide the issue in a manner that honestly confronts them. Specifically, the argument advanced here is <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> confronted with cases of medical futility should decide the issue under principles of tort law, rather than under principles of constitutional law. The crux of this argument is that tort principles provide an open-ended analytical framework conducive to considering troublesome questions like those raised by the respirator scenario, while constitutional principles provide a framework that is conducive to avoiding those questions...|$|R
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under <b>that</b> <b>court</b> ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues <b>that</b> <b>court</b> officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused <b>that</b> <b>court</b> to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{represents}} {{the first attempt}} to study empirically the factors <b>that</b> cause <b>courts</b> to impose disclosure duties on bargaining parties in some circumstances, but not in others. We analyze data coded from 466 decisions spanning {{a wide array of}} jurisdictions and covering over two hundred years. The results are mixed. In some instances our data support the conventional wisdom relating to common-law disclosure duties. For example, we find <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> are more likely to require the disclosure of latent, as opposed to patent, defects {{and are more likely to}} require disclosure when the parties are in a fiduciary or confidential relationship. In other instances, our results cast doubt on much of the conventional wisdom regarding the law of fraudulent silence. First, although it is generally understood <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> have become more likely to impose disclosure duties over time, we find <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> actually have become less likely over time to impose duties to disclose. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we find <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> are no more likely to impose disclosure duties when the information is casually acquired as opposed to deliberately acquired, and that unequal access to information by the contracting parties is not a significant factor <b>that</b> drives <b>courts</b> to find a duty to disclose. We do find, however, that when both factors are present courts are significantly more likely to force disclosure...|$|R
40|$|In 2015 the Criminal Practice Directions (CPD) on {{admissibility}} {{of expert}} evidence in England and Wales were revised. They emphasised the principle <b>that</b> “the <b>court</b> must be satisfied {{that there is}} a sufficiently reliable scientific basis for the evidence to be admitted”. The present paper aims to assist courts in understanding from a scientific perspective what would be necessary to demonstrate the validity of testimony based on forensic voice comparison. We describe different technical approaches to forensic voice comparison that have been used in the UK, and critically review the case law on their admissibility. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> have been inconsistent in their reasoning. In line with the CPD, we recommend <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> enquire as to whether forensic practitioners have made use of data and analytical methods that are appropriate and adequate for the case under consideration, and <b>that</b> <b>courts</b> require forensic practitioners to empirically demonstrate the level of performance of their forensic voice comparison system under conditions reflecting those of the case under consideration...|$|R
5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to <b>that</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
