50|$|There {{are many}} types of water <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> {{available}} for removing metals from acid mine drainage. Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are a relatively recent technology that involves using sulfate-reducing bacteria or limestone or both to neutralize acidity and precipitate metals. These systems are sometimes called “wetlands” or “bioreactors.” Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> differ from active <b>systems</b> (water <b>treatment</b> plants), which commonly use power; use more hazardous chemicals such as hydrated lime, caustic soda, or ammonia; and, are more expensive. Passive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are preferred for sites managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).|$|R
40|$|Recently, algae {{have become}} {{significant}} organisms for biological purification of wastewater {{since they are}} able to accumulate plant nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides, organic and inorganic toxic substances and radioactive matters in their cells/bodies. Biological wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> with micro algae have particularly gained importance in last 50 years and it is now widely accepted that algal wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are as effective as conventional <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> These specific features have made algal wastewaters <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> an significant low-cost alternatives to complex expensive <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> particularly for purification of municipal wastewaters. By this method 70 % of biological oxygen demand, 66 % of chemical oxygen demand, 71 % total nitrogen, 67 % of phosphorus, 54 % volatile solid and 51 % of dissolved solid was reduced...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} natural <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> is the {{re-establishment}} of disturbed ecosystems and their sustainability for benefits to human and nature. The working of natural <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> on ecological principles and their sustainability {{in terms of}} low cost, low energy consumption, and low mechanical technology is highly desirable. The current review presents {{pros and cons of}} the natural <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> their performance, and recent developments to use them in the treatment of various types of wastewaters. Fast population growth and economic pressure in some developing countries compel the implementation of principles of natural treatment to protect natural environment. The employment of these principles for waste treatment not only helps in environmental cleanup but also conserves biological communities. The systems particularly suit developing countries of the world. We reviewed information on constructed wetlands, vermicomposting, role of mangroves, land <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> soil-aquifer <b>treatment,</b> and finally aquatic <b>systems</b> for waste <b>treatment.</b> Economic cost and energy requirements to operate various kinds of natural <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were also reviewed...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the differences in}} activated sludge microbial communities of different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and understand their metabolic potentials, we sampled sludge from every biological treatment unit of 5 full-scale waste water <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> in 3 typical Chinese municipal WWTPs. The microbial communities and overall metabolic patterns were not only affected by influent characteristics but also varied between different biological treatment units. Distinct genera in different wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were identified. The important microorganisms in domestic sewage <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were unclassified SHA- 20, Caldilinea, Dechloromonas, and unclassified genera from Rhodospirilaceae and Caldilineaceae. The important microorganisms in dyeing wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were Nitrospira, Sphingobacteriales, Thiobacillus, Sinobacteraceae and Comamonadaceae. Compared with the obvious differences in microbial community composition, the metabolic potential showed no significant differences.|$|R

25|$|The {{radioactive}} water <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> {{is forced}} to shut down because a filter exceeds its radioactivity limit. The separation unit, which removes caesium from the water, had been expected to last about a month before its cartridge required replacing—at a radiation level of 4 millisieverts per hour. The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.|$|E
25|$|One very {{successful}} example {{of virtual reality}} therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> Virtual Iraq.

25|$|Sedimentation basins (otherwise {{known as}} {{sediment}} basins) {{are used to}} remove (by settling) coarse to medium-sized sediments and to regulate water flows and are often the first element in a WSUD <b>treatment</b> <b>system.</b> They operate through temporary stormwater retention and reduction of ﬂow velocities to promote settling of sediments {{out of the water}} column. They are important as a pretreatment to ensure downstream elements are not overloaded or smothered with coarse sediments. Sedimentation basins can take various forms and can be used as permanent systems integrated into an urban design or temporary measures to control sediment discharge during construction activities. They are often designed as an inlet pond to a bioretention basin or constructed wetland.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a serious}} concern for {{pollution}} in the seas surrounding the Liancourt Rocks. The sewage water <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> established on the islets has malfunctioned and sewage water produced by inhabitants of the Liancourt Rocks such as South Korean Coast Guard and lighthouse staff is being dumped directly into the ocean. Significant water pollution has been observed; sea water has turned milky white, sea vegetation is progressively dying off, and calcification of coral reefs is spreading. The pollution is also causing loss of biodiversity in the surrounding seas. In November 2004, eight tons of malodorous sludge was being dumped into the ocean every day. Efforts have since been made by {{both public and private}} organizations to help curb the level of pollution surrounding the Rocks.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} {{stormwater}} runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems {{capable of handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, {{and they are not}} designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|E
