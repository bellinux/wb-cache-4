5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Adding in Usagi's {{child to}} the Sailor Moon storyline, {{as well as her}} name, Chibiusa for a chibi (little) Usagi, was the idea of Naoko Takeuchi's editor, Fumio Osano. Takeuchi has stated that she did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> how Chibiusa's hair would look, besides it having odango like Usagi's hair and being pink; and that she used a Chibiusa doll for {{reference}} on the hair.|$|E
25|$|In The Gestalt Theory of Motivation (1960), {{the social}} {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby {{people do not}} <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person {{is in the same}} position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.|$|E

500|$|In June 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Hastert had approached a business associate, J. David John, in 2010, {{to look for}} a financial adviser {{to come up with an}} annuity plan that would [...] "generate a substantial cash payout each year." [...] This request was the same year that prosecutors say he agreed to start paying hush money to the person he allegedly committed misconduct against. John told the New York Times that [...] "I did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it at the time, but looking back at it, it does seem strange. He just said he needed to generate some cash." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's name, {{according}} to Erna's statement in a 1999 interview, [...] "I was {{making fun of}} somebody who had a cold sore on his lip {{and the next day}} I had one myself and somebody said, It looks like God smacked your face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Dade County vote, a {{gardener}} {{who worked for the}} City of San Francisco named Robert Hillsborough was stabbed 15 times in his face and chest while his attackers chanted [...] "Faggot" [...] at him. Hillsborough's mother and San Francisco mayor George Moscone blamed Bryant's rhetoric for his death and 200,000San Francisco residents joined a memorial demonstration for him. Mrs. Hillsborough brought a $5 million civil suit against Anita Bryant claiming Hillsborough's attackers said [...] "Here's one for Anita". She said, [...] "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Anita Bryant's campaign at first. Now that my son's murder has happened, I think about the Bryant campaign a lot. Anyone who wants to carry on this kind of thing must be sick. My son's blood is on her hands." [...] Bryant, Green, Mike Thompson and Save Our Children were dismissed from the suit in November 1977.|$|E
5000|$|Boy Nobody is the {{perennial}} new kid in school, the one few notice and nobody <b>thinks</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b> He {{shows up in}} a new high school, in a new town, under a new name, makes few friends and doesn't stay long. Just long enough for someone in his new friend's family to die—of [...] "natural causes." [...] Mission accomplished, Boy Nobody disappears, and moves {{on to the next}} target.|$|R

We didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it but off that we got a deal with Noise, two pages in Kerrang! and a Radio One session. It just snowballed. After the session the label were even more {{interested}} {{and then we got}} the Kerrang! cover after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis did not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the {{conversation}} until he later read the Post Office Department's announcement that had awarded Ludington's arch-rival the CAM 25 {{air mail route}} contract at 89 cents a mile as measured against Ludington's extremely low bid. By February 1933 Ludington was virtually bankrupt and sold out to EAT for a [...] "bottom basement price of $260,000." [...] Lewis sensed {{there was a story}} to be written. He brought the story to the attention of William Randolph Hearst and although Hearst would not print it, was given approval to investigate the story full-time.|$|E
2500|$|Achievement {{motivation}} was studied intensively by David C. McClelland, John W. Atkinson {{and their colleagues}} since the early 1950s. This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state. One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure. In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in {{what they do and}} not <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the failures or the negatives. [...] Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture. [...] There are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to McClelland's research.|$|E

2500|$|... "During {{these two}} years I {{was led to}} <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> religion. Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, & I {{remember}} being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, {{to see that the}} Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> all this. Sir William Martin and I {{have much}} talk about it; and the strong {{practical}} mind of the Primate, I hope, would keep me straight if I was disposed to theorise, which I don't think is the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it when I put it on," [...] said Sam, {{who was a}} very sensitive, and {{not very}} strong-minded youth; [...] "the rest of us did it, you know, by father's advice, and I joined because they did." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{interaction}} between actor {{and the world}} is an act that can be seen in everyday life, and we take them as granted and don't <b>think</b> too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the small detail that needs to happen in order for an act like performing a piece of music to exist. It is similar to the fact that when speaking our mother tongue, we don't <b>think</b> too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> grammar and how to phrase words; they just come out since we are so used to saying them. The actions between an actor and the world, notably, the primary stakeholder (user) and the world in this case, should be thought about in detail, and hence use cases are created to understand how these tiny interactions occur.|$|R
