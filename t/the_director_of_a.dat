He was told he would be travelling with Bandi Grosz (real name, Andor Gross), a Hungarian {{who had worked for}} Hungarian and German military intelligence; Grosz would travel to Istanbul as <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hungarian transport company. The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May, where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for the SS.|$|E

5|$|Fender was {{the elder}} son of Percy Robert Fender, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm of stationers, and Lily, née Herbert. Born in Balham, Surrey, in 1892, he was {{encouraged}} to play cricket by his mother's family {{who were involved in}} Brighton club cricket, and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch Sussex when visiting them. First educated at St George's College, Weybridge, then at St Paul's School, London, Fender did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|Sympathetic towards Chabaneau's {{state of}} poverty, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jesuit college in Passy {{offered him a}} {{position}} as a mathematics professor, despite Chabaneau having only {{a basic understanding of}} arithmetic. In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, natural history, and chemistry. At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly established Real Seminario Patriotico at Vergara to teach French and physics by brothers Fausto and Juan José Elhuyar. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic tungsten, had been hired by the Count of Peñaflorida, who had sent them to France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.|$|E

5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E

25|$|The LOE prescribes that <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> LLC may be sued by {{shareholders}} {{should he}} fail to perform his obligations and duties. In contrast, in a SC, {{there are no}} such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.|$|E
25|$|Some of the oater collaborations between Killy and Holt include: The Fargo Kid (1940), Wagon Train (1940), Along the Rio Grande (1941), and Land of the Open Range (1942). In the mid-1940s, a young actor, Robert Mitchum, {{was signed}} to a seven-year {{contract}} with RKO, {{with the intent}} of making B-Westerns based on Zane Grey novels. Killy was assigned the first of these films, 1944's Nevada. He would also direct Mitchum in another film adaptation of a Grey novel, 1945's West of the Pecos, which was also Killy's last credit as <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> film.|$|E
25|$|Others, such as {{corporate}} directors, may {{be held to}} a {{fiduciary duty}} similar in some respects to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trustee. This happens when, for example, <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bank are trustees for <b>the</b> depositors, <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of interest charges by setting up a blind trust, placing their financial affairs in the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.|$|R

His father, Arturo Falcone, <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> provincial chemical laboratory, was married to Luisa Bentivegna. Giovanni had two older sisters, Anna and Maria. Falcone's parents emphasised the importance of hard work, bravery and patriotism; he later said they 'expected the maximum' from him. At school Falcone would get into fights with larger children if he thought his friends were being picked on.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter's 1990s {{career is}} {{characterized}} by a number of notable failures: Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), Village of the Damned (1995) and Escape from L.A. (1996) are examples of films that were critical and financial failures. Also notable from this decade are Body Bags, a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with Tobe Hooper, In the Mouth of Madness (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics but now has a cult following, and Vampires (1998), which featured James Woods as <b>the</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.|$|E
