5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Like most birds the pittas are monogamous breeders, {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to {{occur at the}} onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus which it breeds on remains wet all year. The courtship behaviours of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the African pitta includes jumping into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> puffed out breast and parachuting down back down to the perch.|$|E
25|$|In July 2017, as {{temperatures}} in the city rose, straphangers expressed complaints about the high temperatures of stations along the line, {{even though they were}} supposed to be climate-controlled.

The MTA had not conducted the test quickly enough, but after criticism, it received permission on July 7. Climate control was expected to be turned on by July 14.|$|E

In two shooting gallery levels, the player rides on the wing of an Arwing or a Wolfen fighter, shooting enemies on the ground and in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plasma cannon.|$|E

25|$|The Patriots {{travelled}} to the Metrodome for a Monday Night Football {{showdown with}} the Minnesota Vikings, who, like the Patriots, boasted an excellent run defense. The Patriots, who took to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spread offense {{for the entire}} game, opened with a seven-play, 86-yard strike that ended with a touchdown pass from Brady to wide receiver Reche Caldwell. Their next drive was for 93 yards {{which resulted in a}} 23-yard Gostkowski field goal. And just before halftime the Patriots moved 74 yards in 11 plays to take a 17–0 lead on a nine-yard scoring toss to tight end Benjamin Watson. The only Vikings score of the game came on a 71-yard punt return by Mewelde Moore in the third quarter; Laurence Maroney immediately answered on the ensuing kickoff, with a 77-yard return to Minnesota's 21-yard line, his second return of over 70 yards in as many weeks. The Patriots' lead grew to 17 after a seven-yard touchdown reception by Brown with 9:03 in the third quarter and then became 31–7 with a touchdown catch by Jackson. The Patriots defense also intercepted four passes from quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger. On Bollinger's first drive after relieving Brad Johnson he was sacked three times in a row for a net loss of 23 yards. With their fourth straight victory, the Patriots advanced to 6–1.|$|E

500|$|On the hotel's {{top floor}} was the roof-garden, {{enclosed}} {{on all sides}} by glass, with a glass roof over.

At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, {{leading up to the}} copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were [...] above the sidewalk. The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style.|$|E
500|$|Coldplay have {{performed}} the song throughout their career, {{and it is}} a firm audience favourite. The band had their debut performance on television on the show Later...with Jools Holland. They performed Parachutess lead single, [...] "Shiver", and the new song, [...] "Yellow"; but it was the latter that had an immediate studio audience impact. They have also performed at the Glastonbury Festival, one of the prominent festivals in Europe. During their second appearance in July 2000, Coldplay performed [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "effortlessly" [...] captured over 10,000 spectators. Coldplay's popularity at this time was still growing and [...] "Yellow" [...] has helped cultivate it; Martin has said it was the best day of their year. During most concert performances, large yellow balloons are dropped on the audience. The first known sighting of yellow balloons was on 24 September 2002 at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. Chris Martin noticed the balloons in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> surprised look. In more recent years, (January 2013) the balloons are filled with confetti, {{and at the end of}} the song Chris Martin would pop one with his guitar causing confetti to fly everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name {{the next time they}} encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E

500|$|Bart {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} fans of children's {{television}} host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, [...] "I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings," [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". and helping Krusty return to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> comeback special and reignite his career in [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored. Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes which often have to do with getting revenge on Bart (and sometimes the entire Simpson family by proxy), but is always foiled in the end.|$|E

Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living {{together}} for a while, Dead and Euronymous [...] "got on each other's nerves a lot" [...] and [...] "weren't really friends at the end". Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated.
