In 1972 he went to Africa, which inspired his work A quale <b>tribù</b> appartieni? (Which Tribe Do You Belong To?), published in the same year. His 1982 trip to Japan, including a visit to Hiroshima, inspired {{a series of articles}} for L'Espresso magazine about the atomic bomb.

2500|$|The {{enrollment}} of new citizens in particular tribes became a significant political issue during the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus in 312 BC. [...] Those {{who wished to}} limit the voting power of the lower social orders, and particularly of freedmen, advocated enrolling them only in the four urban tribes. [...] This effort was largely unsuccessful, except with respect to freedmen, who were nearly always enrolled {{in one of the}} urban tribes. [...] A similar attempt to limit the power of newly enfranchised citizens followed the end of the Social War. [...] It was also possible for one of the censors to punish an individual by expelling him from one of the rustic tribes, and assigning him to one of the urban tribes; this was known as <b>tribu</b> movere.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, the {{dance-band}} {{ensemble of}} Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera performed several [...] songs which they labelled as [...] "bombas"; although these bore some similarities to the sicá style of bomba, in their rhythms and horn arrangements they also borrowed noticeably from the Cuban dance music which {{had long been}} popular in the island. Giving rise to Charanga music. As of the 1980s, bomba had declined, although it was taught, in a somewhat formalized fashion, by the Cepeda family in Santurce, San Juan, and was still actively performed informally, though with much vigor, in the Loíza towns, home to then Ayala family dynasty of bomberos. Bomba continues to survive there, and has also experienced something of a revival, being cultivated by folkoric groups such as Son Del Batey, Los Rebuleadores de San Juan, Bomba Evolución, Abrane y La <b>Tribu</b> and many more else where in the island. In New York City with groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, members of La Casita de Chema, and Alma Moyo. In Chicago Buya, and Afro Caribe have kept the tradition alive and evolving. In California Bomba Liberte, Bombalele, and Los Bomberas de la Bahia are all groups that have promoted and preserved the culture. Women have {{also played a role}} in its revival, {{as in the case of}} the all-female group Yaya, Legacy Woman, Los Bomberas de la Bahia, Grupo Bambula (Originally female group) and Ausuba in Puerto Rico.|$|E

In vol. ii. p. 232, he brings the Banu-Djodha'm (Juzám) from El-Yemen, and settles them in the country of the ancient Midianites. He adds: [...] "La region sur laquelle ils étaient répandus avec leurs frères les Benou-Lakhm, et, je crois aussi, avec les families Codhaites, de Bali (Baliyy) et de Cayn, touchait par l'ouest à la Mer Rouge, par le nord au pays que les Romains appelaient troisième Palestine, par le sud aux déserts [...] . par l'est, enfin, au territoire de Daumat-Djandal sur laquelle campaient les Benou-Kelb, <b>tribu</b> Codhaïte, alors Chrétienne, et alliée ou sujette des Romains." [...] In vol. iii. p. 159, he recounts from the Táríkh el-Khamísí, and the Sírat el-Rasúl, how Zayd made an expedition against the [...] "Djodhám (Juzám) established at Madyan on the coast of the Red Sea." [...] The warrior captured a number of women and children who were exposed for sale, but the [...] "Prophet," [...] hearing the wails of the mothers, ordered that the young ones should not be sold apart from the parents.|$|E
6000|$|While in {{the case}} of the Ashantee tribes, we can only infer the {{existence}} of a belief in kinship with the animals from the presence of the other features of fully developed totemism (especially from the refusal to eat the name-giving animal), we have direct evidence for the opinion in another part of Africa, among the Bechuanas.(1) Casalis, who passed twenty-three years as a missionary in South Africa, thus describes the institution: [...] "While the united communities usually bear the name of their chief or of the district which they inhabit" [...] (local tribes, as in Australia), [...] "each stock (<b>tribu)</b> derives its title from an animal or a vegetable. All the Bechuanas are subdivided thus into Bakuenas (crocodile-men), Batlapis (men of the fish), Banarer (of the buffalo), Banukus (porcupines), Bamoraras (wild vines), and so forth. The Bakuenas call the crocodile their father, sing about him in their feasts, swear by him, and mark the ears of their cattle with an incision which resembles the open jaws of the creature." [...] This custom of marking the cattle with the crest, as it were, of the stock, takes among some races the shape of deforming themselves, so as the more to resemble the animal from which they claim descent. [...] "The chief of the family which holds the chief rank in the stock is called 'The Great Man of the Crocodile'. Precisely in the same way the Duchess of Sutherland is styled in Gaelic 'The Great Lady of the Cat,'" [...] though totemism is probably not the origin of this title.|$|E
6000|$|As in Australia, {{the belief}} in common kin with beasts is most clearly proved by the {{construction}} of Red Indian society. The [...] "totemistic" [...] stage of thought and manners prevails. Thus Charlevoix says,(1) [...] "Plusieurs nations ont chacune trois familles ou tribus principales, AUSSI ANCIENNES, A CE QU'IL PAROIT, QUE LEUR ORIGINE. Chaque <b>tribu</b> porte le nom d'un animal, et la nation entiere a aussi le sien, dont elle prend le nom, et dont la figure est sa marque, ou, se l'on veut, ses armoiries, on ne signe point autrement les traites qu'en traceant ces figures." [...] Among the animal totems Charlevoix notices porcupine, bear, wolf and turtle. The armoiries, the totemistic heraldry of the peoples of Virginia, greatly interested a heraldic ancestor of Gibbon the historian,(2) who settled in the colony. According to Schoolcraft,(3) the totem or family badge, of a dead warrior is drawn in a reverse position on his grave-post. In {{the same way the}} leopards of England are drawn reversed on the shield of an English king opposite the mention of his death in old monkish chronicles. As a general rule,(4) persons bearing the same totem in America cannot intermarry. [...] "The union must be between various totems." [...] Moreover, {{as in the case of}} the Australians, [...] "the descent of the chief is in the female line". We thus find among the Red Men precisely the same totemistic regulations as among the Aborigines of Australia. Like the Australians, the Red Men [...] "never" [...] (perhaps we should read [...] "hardly ever") eat their totems. Totemists, in short, spare the beasts that are their own kith and kin. To avoid multiplying details which all corroborate each other, it may suffice to refer to Schoolcraft for totemism among the Iowas(5) and the Pueblos;(6) for the Iroquois, to Lafitau, a missionary of the early part of the eighteenth century. Lafitau was perhaps the first writer who ever explained certain features in Greek and other ancient myths and practices as survivals from totemism. The Chimera, a composite creature, lion, goat and serpent, might represent, Lafitau thought, a league of three totem tribes, just as wolf, bear and turtle represented the Iroquois League.|$|E

5000|$|The ati-ati, now {{popularly known}} as [...] "ati-atihan" [...] in Philippine fiestas, {{used to be one}} of the main events of the festival. Patterned after the famous ati-ati of Aklan, the Binirayan ati-ati is participated in by people of all walks of life {{painting}} their faces with black soot.

It also boosted the popularity of Binirayan Festival as a major festival in Region VI. In later years, however, the high cost of maintaining tribes, prevented many tribes join the ati-ati competition. In 2001, the Binirayan Executive Committee repackaged the competition as Malay-Ati competition to introduce the idea that the Malays and Ati are the ancestors of the Antiqueños. Current Malay-Ati performance show historical events, folk practices and lifestyles in Antique. The competition in April 2008 was a best of the best among festivals in the province.|$|E
