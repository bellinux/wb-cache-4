5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{backlash}} against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attack}} on Kaafjord was being conducted, the {{commander}} of the German submarines in the Norwegian sea ordered Group Trutz to take up new positions to the south-east of Jan Mayen and intercept the British ships as they returned to Scapa Flow.

5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|After the Gas Boom began <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> {{state in}} the 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} {{the creation of a}} public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{started the}} first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in eight innings.

5|$|Bryan {{had hoped}} <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, {{but he was}} not successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{defeating}} the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated. Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-final. The blue, blanc et rouge swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers. In the first game, played at Mount Royal Arena in Montreal, Canadiens rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat trick as Montreal won 6–1. Due to poor ice conditions, {{the second game}} {{was moved to the}} Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa. Led by goaltender Georges Vezina, Montreal won 3–0 <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> series, and claim the Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{first season}} in Denver, the Avalanche won the Pacific Division {{and went on}} <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Florida Panthers in the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals, {{becoming}} the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup in the season following a relocation. Among teams in the major North American professional sports leagues, only the National Football League (NFL)'s Washington Redskins have also accomplished the feat. This {{was the first major}} professional sports championship a Denver-based team would bring to the city.|$|E

5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E

The Giants went on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Tigers in the World Series, and Zito went 2–0 with a 1.69 earned run average in the postseason.|$|E
5|$|The NHL {{doubled in}} size to 12 teams in 1967–68 and {{organized}} itself into two divisions: the East Division, with the original six teams, and the West Division, which contained the six expansion franchises. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Canadiens recovered from their loss in 1967 <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> St. Louis Blues four games to none in both 1968 and 1969 for their 15th and 16th championships.|$|E

A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
5|$|In 1996–97, Colorado won the Pacific Division, {{as well as}} the Presidents' Trophy for {{finishing}} the regular season with {{the best record in the}} league: 49–24–9 for 107 points. The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the league's first All-Star team at the end of the season.|$|E

In the third game of the National League Division Series, Granderson picked up five RBI – this tied a Mets single game postseason record previously set by Carlos Delgado in the 2006 National League Championship Series, Edgardo Alfonzo in the 1999 NLCS and Rusty Staub in the 1973 World Series. After beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the NLDS, the Mets went on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Cubs in four games in the NLCS and advance to their first World Series since 2000.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gerhard Schöpfel, leading III./JG 26 and Bf 109s from JG 3, 40 in total, {{were already}} {{crossing}} the Dover straits <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> skies {{clear of the}} main raid. Some 25 miles behind him were the 27 Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 escorted by 20 Bf 110s that were to strike Kenley. Close by the Dorniers were the Ju 88s of III./KG 76 escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51. This formation should have been 15 miles in front. Some 15 miles {{to the rear of}} the Ju88s, KG 1's He 111s were bound for Biggin Hill, escorted by 40 Bf 109s from JG 54. The formations were moving at around three miles per minute, at 12,000 feet. Around 50 miles to the south-west, the nine Do 17s of 9 Staffel were at wave-top height, halfway between Dieppe, Seine-Maritime and Beachy Head, intent on sneaking under British radar beams unobserved. Altogether, the raiding force contained 108 bombers and 150 fighters.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October, the {{majority}} of the fleet conducted a sweep into the North Sea, returning to port on 15 October. During 2–5 November, Marlborough participated in a fleet training operation west of the Orkneys. Another such cruise took place during 1–4 December. The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January 1916. The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. On the night of 25 March, Iron Duke {{and the rest of the}} fleet sailed from Scapa Flow, to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern.|$|E
5|$|Pelorus {{was named}} after Pelorus Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand. The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was {{launched}} on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October. The ship {{was assigned to the}} newly formed 7th Minesweeping Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>the</b> minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. Pelorus led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a mine that damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla at Plymouth when they were completed.|$|E
