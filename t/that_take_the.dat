5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> visitor through {{a range of}} locations, {{each with its own}} specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E

25|$|Skulachev has {{suggested}} that programmed ageing assists the evolution process by providing a gradually increasing challenge or obstacle to survival and reproduction, and therefore enhancing the selection of beneficial characteristics. In this sense, ageing would act {{in a manner similar}} to that of mating rituals <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> form of contests or trials that must be overcome in order to mate (another individually adverse observation). This suggests an advantage of gradual ageing over sudden death as a means of lifespan regulation.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted {{just above}} {{does not use}} {{calorimetry}} or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference {{is supposed to have}} been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.|$|E

Some nouns have competing plural forms.|$|E

The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> aircraft from forward flight into a [...] hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system.

500|$|This {{underground}} station's only mezzanine is at {{the east}} end of station adjacent to the Manhattan-bound platform. Access to both platforms is via an overpass above the tracks, with staircases, escalators and elevators to platform level. At this point, the station has a high ceiling. The platform walls as well as the floor are made of brick, and towards the top of the platform walls is a line of larger brown sheets, on these are the station signs at regular intervals that say [...] "21 Street–Queensbridge." [...] Above this is a thin black strip of metal and above this are yellow squares <b>that</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> platform walls up to the station ceiling that is made of concrete.
