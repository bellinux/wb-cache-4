5|$|After Prapiroon dissipated, the {{regional}} Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the {{damage in the}} wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span.

5|$|During the Second World War, Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a {{vigorous}} {{advocate of the}} Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed after the Soviet pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland— however, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski's request that <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> investigate the Katyń Forest massacre.|$|E

The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E

5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement, the UN {{often takes}} {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E
5|$|Following the flooding, {{the local}} governments in Valladolid and San Enrique {{declared}} a state of calamity to allow funds to reach flood victims. By September26, about PHP700,000 ($14,000USD) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP480,000 ($10,000USD) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September20, the Chinese Government allocated ¥81million ($11.8million USD) in living subsidies for those affected by the typhoon. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> which was already assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments.

5|$|Following the hurricane, <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement {{launched}} an emergency appeal for Cuba.

The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks. The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses {{in the weeks after}} the storm.|$|E
50|$|Adelaide made {{a number}} of signings to replace the players which left in the {{off-season}}, most notably former Sydney FC defenders, Iain Fyfe and Mark Rudan, Korean youngster Inseob Shin and former Drogheda United midfielder Adam Hughes. Arguably the biggest off-season signing was former Cheltenham Town and Brentford striker, Lloyd Owusu, a capped Ghanaian <b>international.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> also elevated a handful of players from their Youth squad to the senior team, namely Francesco Monterosso, Michael Marrone and Joe Costa.|$|R

2500|$|Although differing {{from the}} design {{originally}} laid down (see Regulatory Signs below), [...] "Keep Left" [...] and [...] "Keep Right" [...] signs are now mostly white {{on a blue}} background, on the British pattern. In order to avail themselves of standard designs from British suppliers, local authorities had made extensive use of the white-on-blue design, mostly because the electronically lit type of white-on-blue was more practical, in consequence of which legislation was enacted making both patterns legal. Under the Irish Power of One (energy conservation campaign) the electronic signs are being gradually replaced by reflective signs. The former [...] "No Entry" [...] sign, a prohibititon sign with an upward pointing arrow, was replaced with <b>the</b> <b>international</b> standard <b>red</b> disk in TSM 2010.

5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion {{and the availability of}} other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded, with the exception of Liechtenstein, by the Axis. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy, but not {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E
25|$|Rosso Corsa is <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>international</b> motor racing {{color of}} cars entered by teams from Italy.

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} open reduction internal fixation and {{total hip arthroplasty}} directions, results and complications associated with internal fixation in managing these fractures. Methods: In 8 years at 4 centers, 61 patients with associated acetabular fractures (Letournel classification) were treated. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups. The total hip arthoplasty (THA) group consisted of 30 patients, while the open reduction internal fixation group had 31 patients. The average age of the patients was 74. 7 years. The following parameters were compared: the duration of surgery and hospitalization, <b>the</b> <b>international</b> unit of <b>red</b> blood cell concentrate transfusion, the time for the verticalization of the patient, perioperative complications, Harris hip score, and the short form (12) health survey. The clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with post-traumatic osteoarthritis formed the third comparison group. P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant according to the analytical Student’s t-test. Results: The P < 0. 05 in favor of the THA group was: surgical time, length of stay, number of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> unit of <b>red</b> blood cell concentrate transfusions, verticalization, quality of life and hip function, a reduction of perioperative complications and reinterventions. Conclusions: Our experience shows that the THA treatment for acetabular fractures in the elderly is to be preferred...|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the recovery was very slow {{since many of the}} few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross,</b> while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> and Red Crescent Movement sent 300 food packages, 300 kitchen kits, 200 mattresses, 300 hygiene kits, 150 hammocks, plastic sheeting, and 26.4tons (24tonnes) of {{construction}} materials and tools to Nicaragua. As a precaution, about 2.2tons (2tonnes) of food was also {{sent to the}} National Society's warehouse in Bogotá. A total of $116,367 was also allocated from disaster relief funds. The Justice, Global & Ecumenical Relations Unit in Canada also provided $6,500 in relief funds to Nicaragua. Two shipments of relief supplies {{were sent to the}} hardest hit areas by Direct Relief International. The first shipment arrived on November9; it contained 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of antibiotics valued at $237,241. The second shipment arrived on November22; it contained numerous supplies, valued at $139,283, which would be delivered to the hardest hit areas.

5|$|Following {{the impacts}} of Wipha to the already {{severely}} flooded areas of North Korea, <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Cross</b> delivered relief supplies to the 2,000 people made homeless by the typhoon. Hundreds of medical clinics which were damaged or destroyed set up makeshift clinics as up to 70 percent of the affected population reported abdominal pains or diarrhea. More than 23,000 volunteers from the Red Cross mobilized to provide quick rehabilitation in the affected regions. By mid-September, €420,000 ($527,000 USD) was provided to repair hospitals and an additional €110,000 ($138,000USD) was planned to be sent. By the end of September, health kits were provided for 300,000 people and an additional $300,000 (USD) was provided for medical supplies in hospitals. From October15 to 18, a Rapid Nutritional Screening of children {{took place in the}} worst affected areas. Eleven hospitals were restocked with medical supplies and a permanent water supply was constructed at the Wonsan general hospital. About $180,000 in aid from Norway was sent to North Korea. By October 22, 2007, 80 percent of the $14.1million pledged in assistance had been funded. About 4,800 tonnes of cereal was to be distributed in October as part of the second shipment of food, following the first which was sent prior to Wipha. Funds and materials, worth $166,000 (USD), for revegetation were expected to arrive between December 2007 and February 2008.|$|E
50|$|Another common graphic {{found on}} nursing pins is the symbol we {{associate}} with <b>the</b> <b>international</b> association of <b>the</b> <b>red</b> crescent and <b>red</b> <b>cross,</b> namely the <b>red</b> <b>cross</b> itself. In times past, young women who adopted the profession of nursing were accepted as nurses, particularly in overseas service roles, such as military and mission work, when they joined the <b>red</b> <b>cross</b> society. Volunteers usually had to supply their own uniforms, equipment and generally had to undertake charitable works {{in order to raise}} funds for their own passage to the area of identified need. Red cross nurses are honoured in the 1916 song Rose of no man's land but were {{by no means the only}} volunteers. Nurses were also drawn from organisations like the ancient order of deaconesses and quaker ambulance units. The situation changed during the great war, in which the contribution of nursing to the war effort was recognised in several urgent recruitment drives. As nurses were granted access to postings, commissions and pensions, amateur involvement declined.|$|R
