2500|$|The Silent Way is a {{discovery}} learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space {{for the students to}} explore the language.

[...] The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way {{is a good example of}} the Articulatory Approach.|$|E

Gladwell argued that the Black Justice League should have been willing to sacrifice their positions at Princeton and threaten to drop out instead of holding a sit-in if they were serious about creating change on their campus. He said, “Instead of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were owed by Princeton, <b>they</b> should have <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were willing to give up. Generosity mixed with orthodoxy.

I saw him at Culloden, when all was lost, doing more than twenty of these bleezing braggarts, till the very soldiers that took him cried not to hurt him--for all somebody's orders, provost--for he was the bravest fellow of them all. Weel, as I went by the side of Harry, and felt him raise my hand up in the mist of the morning, as if he wished to wipe his eye--for he had not that freedom without my leave--my very heart was like to break for him, poor fellow. In the meanwhile, I had been trying and trying to make my hand as fine as a lady's, to see if I could slip it out of my iron wristband. You may think,' he said, laying his broad bony hand on the table, 'I had work enough with such a shoulder-of-mutton fist; but if you observe, the shackle-bones are of the largest, and so they were obliged to keep the handcuff wide; at length I got my hand slipped out, and slipped in again; and poor Harry was sae deep in his ain thoughts, I could not make him sensible what I was doing.' ...|$|E
