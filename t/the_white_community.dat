5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol {{was a major}} issue in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community,</b> leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} led to <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> {{also becoming}} increasing radicalised. Some whites planned {{to attempt a}} coup d'état if a black majority government took power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Européens ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.|$|E

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>communities</b> in African {{countries}} {{suffered a}} variety of fates in the post-colonial period. In many countries (e.g. Kenya, Namibia and Botswana) <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>communities</b> survived and actually grew in number. In two particular cases, Algeria and Zimbabwe, the previously large European communities have shrunk. In both these last cases, <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>communities</b> had {{put up a fight}} against decolonisation and many white people found it difficult to adjust to the realities of the world they found themselves in after independence. Many neutral observers feel that the failure of some newly independent African countries and their white minorities {{to come to terms with}} one another was to the mutual disadvantage of both parties. For example, expatriate white farmers and hoteliers from Zimbabwe have done much to revive agriculture and develop tourism in neighbouring Zambia.|$|R

5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> had united against them, and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen could be counted on in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a number of its white officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E

5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community.</b> Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community.</b> The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} pride for <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community,</b> as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E

25|$|Due {{in large}} part to his {{popularity}} amongst the black population, Stephens was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1868, displacing sitting senator Bedford Brown, who was quite popular among <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community.</b> This further inflamed the already significant antipathy that the local white population of Caswell County felt for him. During this time, Stephens became nearly completely isolated socially from <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community,</b> {{to the extent that he}} was kicked out of the local Methodist church. Many unsubstantiated rumors were circulated amongst the white population regarding his personal life, including claims that he had burnt the crops and buildings of fellow citizens. His political opponents, consisting mainly of white conservative Democrats, even claimed Stephens had murdered his own mother who did die under rather unusual circumstances. However, none of these claims ever resulted in any form of legal action against Stephens, which seems to mitigate against the veracity of such claims.|$|E
25|$|In African-American music, gospel quartets {{developed}} an a cappella style following the earlier {{success of the}} Fisk Jubilee Singers. The 1930s saw the Fairfield Four, the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, The Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Charioteers, and the Golden Gate Quartet. Racism divided the nation, and this division did not skip the church. If during slavery blacks were treated as inferior inside the white churches, after emancipation they formed their own separate churches. The gospel groups which were very popular within the black community, were virtually unknown to <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community,</b> though some in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>community</b> began to follow them. In addition to these high-profile quartets, there were many black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing {{in the streets of}} Southern cities. Famous among them were Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Joe Taggart and others.|$|E

The Southern Negro Youth Congress performed such studies as taking items being purchased in a black community and then comparing the prices to those same items being purchased in a <b>white</b> <b>community.</b> This study showed that prices for the same goods were 20-30% higher in the black communities then they were in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>communities,</b> which meant that the citizens who were struggling most to survive were actually paying higher prices for the items that were necessary for them to live.|$|R
