6000|$|A long-legged mule, after gibbing {{enough to}} satisfy his own self- respect, condescended to trot off with us up the tramway, which lay along a green drove strangely like one in the Cambridgeshire fens. [...] But in the ditches grew a pea with large yellow flower-spikes, which {{reminded}} us {{that we were not}} in England; and beyond the ditches rose on either side, not wheat and beans, but sugar-cane ten and twelve feet high. And a noble grass it is, with its stems as thick as one's wrist, <b>tillering</b> out below in bold curves over the well-hoed dark soil, and its broad bright leaves falling and folding above in curves as bold as those of the stems: handsome enough thus, but more handsome still, I am told, when the 'arrow,' as the flower is called, spreads over the cane-piece a purple haze, which flickers in long shining waves before the breeze. One only fault it has; that, from the luxuriance of its growth, no wind can pass through it; and that therefore the heat of a cane-field trace is utterly stifling. [...] Here and there we passed a still uncultivated spot; a desolate reedy swamp, with pools, and stunted alder-like trees, reminding us again of the Deep Fens, while the tall chimneys of the sugar-works, and the high woods beyond, completed the illusion. One might have been looking over Holm Fen toward Caistor Hanglands; or over Deeping toward the remnants of the ancient Bruneswald.|$|E

This enables them to produce multiple stems (tillers) starting from the initial single seedling.

40|$|Selecting {{seedling}} morphological traits {{may affect}} seedling vigor, stand establishment, and mature plant characteristics. Objectives {{of this research}} were to determine (1) the heritability of seedling <b>tiller</b> number and shoot weight in big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) seedlings 6 to 8 weeks after planting, (2) the change in seedling <b>tiller</b> number and fresh shoot weight following two cycles of divergent selection for seedling <b>tiller</b> number while selecting for high shoot weight in big bluestem and switchgrass, (3) the effect of seedling <b>tiller</b> number on seedling morphological development and growth, and (4) the effect of seedling <b>tiller</b> number on mature plant characteristics and leaf elongation rate. ^ Results of these experiments demonstrated that seedling <b>tiller</b> number in big bluestem and switchgrass is moderately heritable (0. 23 to 0. 26) and that positive and negative changes in seedling <b>tiller</b> number were made by divergent selection. Seedling <b>tiller</b> number {{had no effect on}} seedling root growth and development, or stand establishment. Plant types derived from single <b>tiller</b> seedlings had a greater leaf elongation rate than plant types derived from multiple <b>tiller</b> seedlings. Plant characteristics, like plant height, leaf width, leaf length, and yield per <b>tiller</b> were greater for mature plants derived from single <b>tiller</b> seedlings. Number of <b>tillers</b> per plant was greater for mature plants derived from multiple <b>tiller</b> seedlings, but herbage yield of space-planted plants was not different for mature plants derived from seedlings differing in <b>tiller</b> number. Prior research has shown that high yield per <b>tiller</b> genotypes planted in swards have higher herbage yields than low yield per <b>tiller</b> genotypes, thus seedling <b>tiller</b> number in big bluestem and switchgrass should be a useful trait for changing mature plant morphology and improving herbage yield of these grasses. ...|$|R
