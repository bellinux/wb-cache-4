50|$|Copper, silicon, nickel, chromium, and {{phosphorus}} {{are added to}} increase corrosion resistance. Zirconium, calcium, and rare earth elements are added for sulfide-inclusion shape control which increases formability. These are needed because most HSLA steels have directionally sensitive properties. Formability and impact strength can vary significantly when tested longitudinally and <b>transversely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> Bends that are parallel to the longitudinal grain {{are more likely to}} crack around the outer edge because it experiences tensile loads. This directional characteristic is substantially reduced in HSLA steels that have been treated for sulfide shape control.|$|E
