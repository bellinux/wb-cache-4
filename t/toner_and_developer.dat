40|$|This thesis {{will show}} how the Taguchi {{technique}} {{can be applied to}} a complex system and can be optimized with a minimum number of tests. The focus of this thesis is the application of Taguchi methods to the optimization of a xerographic developer auger system. An auger system was optimized to minimize the toner concentration across the magnetic roll. By minimizing the toner concentration variation across the magnetic roll, the visual density variation on the customer prints can be minimized. The technique was applied by determining the proper control factors {{that can be used to}} minimize the variation of the toner concentration. For this study, the auger pitch, auger design, auger speed and mass on the magnetic roll were chosen for the investigation. The worst case print area coverages were used as noise conditions. In this case there were, a blank page, a seventy five percent area coverage and a fifteen percent localized band. The response is the toner concentration standard deviation across the roll. The technique uses the minimization of the response in the presence of the noise conditions to optimize the system against the noises. The study provides an industrial application of the Taguchi methodologies and resulted in a significant improvement of the xerographic developer housing auger system. The optimum conditions found to minimize the variation in the toner concentration across the magnetic roll were found to be: 1) The 4890 style Mix auger (a style of auger that is designed to mix the <b>toner</b> <b>and</b> <b>developer</b> more efficiently) 2) The pitch to diameter of the Pick-up auger is optimal at 0. 5 (P:D) 3) The speed of the Mix auger is optimal at 200 RPM resulting in a pick up auger speed of 140 RPM 4) The mass on the magnetic roll is optimal at 0. 2 gms/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|A {{transition}} {{is needed to}} shift the global economy to a more sustainable and clean economy to counteract the depletion of abiotic resources, generation of emissions and waste. Replacing petroleum plastics by bio-plastics is key to this move. This study identifies the bio-based and bio-degradable plastics, polyhydroyalkanoates (PHAs) as promising alternatives to petroleum plastics. PHAs are biologically synthesised polyesters which accumulate intracellularly {{in the presence of}} excess carbon from renewable resources and, limited nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus or sulphur. Different PHA polyesters can be synthesised by varying the growth conditions of the microbial culture. The flexible nature of PHA synthesis results in a large group of PHA polyesters with a variety of properties that span those of petroleum plastics in terms of strength, rigidity, durability and mechanical properties. Due to their versatility, PHAs have a wide range of applications in packaging and coating, health care and hygiene products, fibres, adhesives, components of <b>toner</b> <b>and</b> <b>developer</b> fluids and medical sutures and implant materials. Waste products of PHA production are mostly carbon dioxide and water. PHAs are biodegradable in all living systems including marine environment. PHAs are also bio-compatible and thus are not toxic to living organisms. In spite of the numerous advantages that PHAs offer, they have not yet achieved substantial commercial success due to poor market penetration arising from their high costs of production. The typical PHA sale price ranged from $ 4 to 9 /kg in 2014. Factors that have been reported to affect the production costs of PHAs are the PHA content and concentration achieved by the microorganism, the purification and recovery process of PHAs together with the type of carbon substrate used. Additionally, the efficiency of the cell disruption and energy required for the washing steps can also influence the production system and are addressed in this study along with the other factors. The overall PHA production system must also be sustainable minimising its energy, water usage and carbon dioxide emissions. When faced with limited time and resources, insight is needed to identify which of the aforementioned factors or combination of factors are more crucial to optimise in order to lower production costs and environmental burden. Economic assessment is a powerful tool to identify promising economically viable process options and discard unfavourable ones. Since PHA production is not an established technology, process conditions and pilot scale data are not easily available. This study proposes a generic large scale PHA production system that can be simulated using minimum inputs to deliver material and energy inventories which can further be used to investigate the production costs of PHAs. The PHA monomer that was simulated is the most characterised PHA, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) ...|$|E
50|$|After cleaning, {{the print}} is redeveloped. A variety of fresh or {{exhausted}} developers {{can be used}} at various dilutions, {{as well as some}} <b>toners.</b> Different <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> dilutions will result in different tonalities in the paper. Areas where the emulsion has been degraded may redevelop unevenly. Emulsion removal can cause a reversal effect when redeveloped. Once the image has been redeveloped, it is rinsed off again. The print can be fixed in fixer at this point. Neglecting to fix the image can lead to the oxidation of the print, however these color shifts can be a desirable effect.|$|R
40|$|What {{this thesis}} {{attempts}} to present is a systematic and ordered assembling of different true chemical toners on {{two types of}} black and white enlarging papers with two different developers. It is my hope that this study will be of some use as a reference in what effect it is possible to achieve with different combinations of <b>toners,</b> papers, <b>and</b> <b>developers.</b> Although not all possible combinations have been tried, most color choices are represented and I decided to display the same image repeatedly. A conventional paper developer, Kodak Dektol, as well as a developer of somewhat higher quality with a Glycin base, GAF 130, were used. Each respective thesis has its own enlarged and toned black and white photographic prints. An attempt has been made to try to report results clearly and factually, and to try to keep this paper as visual as possible. All toners are found with their respective formulas and all information necessary to duplicate results is supplied. I felt it was necessary to display the real effect of toners upon modern photographic materials because of their inherent capability to alter a convectional black and white photographic print. This alteration will ultimately affect the response of the viewer through the emotional impact of color. by Micaela Garzoni Rantoul. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|Bell's theorem {{states that}} quantum {{mechanics}} is not a locally causal theory. This state is often interpreted as nonlocality in quantum mechanics. <b>Toner</b> <b>and</b> Bacon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 187904 (2003) ] have shown that a shared random-variables theory augmented by one bit of classical communication exactly simulates the Bell correlation in a singlet state. In this paper, we show that in <b>Toner</b> <b>and</b> Bacon protocol, {{one of the parties}} (Bob) can deduce another party's (Alice) measurement outputs, if she only informs Bob of one of her own outputs. Afterwards, we suggest a nonlocal version of <b>Toner</b> <b>and</b> Bacon protocol wherein classical communications is replaced by nonlocal effects, so that Alice's measurements cause instantaneous effects on Bob's outputs. In the nonlocal version of <b>Toner</b> <b>and</b> Bacon's protocol, we get the same result again. We also demonstrate that the same approach is applicable to Svozil's protocol.
