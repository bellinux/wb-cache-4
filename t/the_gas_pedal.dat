25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E
500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal...</b> so, hold on to your hats. [...] Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a Swedish national experiment with different types of Intelligent Speed Adaptation, 300 vehicles are being equipped with an active <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> in <b>the</b> city of Lund. <b>The</b> active <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> provides drivers with counter-force whenever they try to exceed the pre-set speed limit. During the experiment the equipment will be continuously set on the actual speed limit. The vehicles will also be equipped with digital maps with all the speed limits within the city limit and a GPS system. Both private- and company cars, including professional drivers will participate in the trial. All vehicles will be equipped with data logging facilities. The selection of the test drivers is made by age groups, gender and attitude to <b>the</b> active <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> (positive and negative). An extensive evaluation will be carried out in order to study driver behaviour, acceptance and effects on safety, travel time and the environment. In {{order to be able to}} observe any attitude changes in the city, surveys with 750 citizens are carried out before the start of the project and after the project has been realised. In order to study driver reactions and behaviour, in-car observations with the help of “Wiener fahrprobe” will be carried out. In order to see any changes in the attitude and acceptance of the test drivers, they will be interviewed when recruited, during the test drives and after the trial. A number of drivers will also be asked to fill in a diary every day on their driving. Driving data will be logged in the test cars and speed profiles, <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> activity, travel time and exhaust emissions will be analysed. In order to measure possible system effects, a number of studies will be carried out in the field: traffic counting, speed measurements, observations of interactions between road-users, observation of frequency in driving against red.

2500|$|Traditionally, manga stories {{flow from}} top to bottom and from right to left. Some {{publishers}} of translated manga keep to this original format. Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation, changing the reading direction to a more [...] "Western" [...] left to right, so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics-consumers. This practice is known as [...] "flipping". For the most part, criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator (for example, if a person wears a shirt that reads [...] "MAY" [...] on it, and gets flipped, then the word is altered to [...] "YAM"), who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions, resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously. If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture, such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic. Characters shown writing with their right hands, the majority of them, would become left-handed when a series is flipped. Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts, such as a car being depicted with <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> on the left and the brake on the right, or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side, but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow, and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyse driving behaviour and to characterize the effectsof an efficient way of driving, termed eco-driving, that enables the driver to reduce fuelconsumption and CO 2 emissions. The approach used to assess driving style {{is a collection of}} data from a CAN bus of acar equipped with OBD-II (on-board diagnostic) system. The driving experiment wasperformed for nine drivers who drove in a normal way or regular driving style and onedriver was an eco-driver who drove in an economical driving style. The driving routewas approximately 18. 7 kms (which took between 25 to 30 minutes) in Halmstad city,Sweden. The drivers are compared using a statistical analysis of the driving parameters such as,speed, accelerator (<b>gas</b> <b>pedal)</b> and brake pressure, which are obtained from CAN busdata. A hierarchical clustering algorithm also used to classify the drivers based on theaverage result of the signals. In the results, a driving difference between the eco-driver and the normal drivers is visi-ble, most of the normal drivers have more or less similar behaviour. The average speed ofthe eco-driver lower than the normal drivers and <b>the</b> accelerator (<b>gas</b> <b>pedal)</b> result is alsoshown less usage by the eco-driver than the normal drivers.
