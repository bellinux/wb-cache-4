Her books are in fact [...] "rooted in the pseudo-theosophy pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater." [...] He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater's [...] "fantasy" [...] of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey's Great Invocation, a prayer supposed to [...] "induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [...] enter into major cities" [...] to lead the Aquarian Age. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on [...] "the [...] Christos principle within each person". [...] However, Nicholas Weeks' thesis would seem to be, in part, contrary to statements where Bailey emphasized <b>the</b> <b>Christos</b> principle in each person, e.g.: [...] "The Christ {{of history and the}} Christ in the human heart are planetary facts." ...|$|E
