5|$|Although much of {{this work}} has focused on {{independent}} sets in sparse graphs, a case {{that does not make}} sense for the complementary clique problem, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been an {{increased}} emphasis on crew comfort in this class of ships with more spacious accommodation being provided. Also, INS Shivalik is the first ship in the Indian Navy with chapati- and dosa-makers on board.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been {{speculation}} of {{the identity}} of the Rival Poet. George Chapman and Christopher Marlowe, are typically considered to be the two most likely rivals, due to their publicity, profession, relations, and standing with Shakespeare during the presumed time of writing.|$|E

5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips {{in the corners of}} the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E
5|$|Deptford's {{population}} has been mainly associated with the docks since {{the establishment of the}} Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been some market gardening and potteries. When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E
5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission {{began to}} lose ground to the larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased {{with the creation of}} the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.|$|E

5|$|In this period, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been {{widespread}} cosmetic {{changes to}} stations, including {{the restoration of}} historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which {{dates back to the}} 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Quyllur Rit'i also attracts {{visitors}} {{from outside the}} Paucartambo and Quispicanchis moieties. Since the 1970s, {{an increasing number of}} middle-class mainstream Peruvians undertake the pilgrimage, some of them at a different date than more traditional pilgrims. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a rapid {{growth in the number of}} North American and European tourists drawn to the indigenous festival, prompting fears that it is becoming too commercialized. The pilgrimage and associated festival were inscribed in 2011 on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E
5|$|Recently, he {{has become}} a less obscure figure with the {{publication}} of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for New Yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been {{a general}} {{feeling of a}} shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies {{that have been}} suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem {{was the subject of}} an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992â€“1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge is publicly available.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{hiatus of}} six years before Sebastian Faulks was {{commissioned}} to write a further Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth. This was followed in 2011 by a novel by American author Jeffery Deaver, a 2013 book by William Boyd and a further instalment in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a spin-off series of books, Young Bond, based around Bond's adventures whilst a schoolboy at Eton College.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of {{a decline in the}} number of students studying the subjects. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.|$|E
5|$|With growing {{prosperity}} {{since the}} last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been significant immigration from Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley during the winter to hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before turning away in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been a path between the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E
