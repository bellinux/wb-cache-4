5|$|They {{performed}} the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> arrive at people's houses {{where they would}} sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with their broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols at this point. Upon being presented with payment, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> leave to repeat the process at another house.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one <b>team</b> <b>would</b> try to transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other <b>team</b> <b>would</b> attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended into chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E
5000|$|... 48 {{players were}} chosen in the draft, two from each franchise. Only one goaltender or one defensemen could be {{selected}} from each franchise.

5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of play and the player personnel of a <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, coach Henning {{said that}} Tolliver was to be the starter heading into next season, and that the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> not protect Vlasic under Plan B free agency, meaning he could sign with any {{interested}} team.

5|$|Many at Bathurst High School {{speculated that}} its senior varsity {{basketball}} <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able}} to continue after the crash.

5|$|The Browns did {{not have}} any draft choices from 1996 to 1998, because then-owner Art Modell took all the team's players to Baltimore, Maryland, {{effectively}} stopping the franchise.

5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The main {{competition}} {{consisted of}} two groups, each with four English, and four Italian teams. Each <b>team</b> <b>would</b> play four group games – against every team in its group from the other nation.

25|$|Founded in 1991, the Danish Superliga {{replaced}} the Danish 1st Division {{as the highest}} league of football in Denmark. From the start in 1991, 10 teams were participating. The opening Superliga season was played {{during the spring of}} 1991, with the ten teams playing each other twice for the championship title. From the summer of 1991, the tournament structure would stretch over two years. The 10 <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play each other twice {{in the first half of}} the tournament. In the following spring, the bottom two <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> be cut off, the points of the <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> be cut in half, and the remaining eight <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> once more play each other twice, for a total of 32 games in a season.|$|R
50|$|The Detour {{for this}} leg was {{a choice between}} Horse (上馬 Shàngmǎ) or Salt (下水 Xiàshuǐ). In both Detour choices, <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> drive their Infiniti to the {{respective}} locations. In Horse, <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> take part in Turkish archery.

In Salt, <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> have to carry bags of salt (25-kg) and have to dump the contents to the pool until its density achieves neutral buoyancy. <b>Teams</b> <b>would</b> have to be floated in the pool, and they read a newspaper article regarding the teams on the race. If teams can accomplish this, they receive their next clue.|$|R
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AWM) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) {{continued}} their rivalry at Turning Point in a match that was contested inside a 16foot (4.9m) high steel structure with six sides {{known as a}} Six Sides of Steel.
