40|$|Direct or {{indirect}} measurements of fluid flow {{out of the}} toe of accretionary wedges have now {{been made in the}} Barbados, Central Oregon, Northern Cascadia and Nankai subduction zones. The steady-state local compaction model predicts velocities of fractions of a millimetre per year and <b>total</b> <b>outflows</b> from the toe of a few cubic metres per year per metre of length along strike of the subduction zone (m 2 a-'). Sea bottom measurements reveal channellized flows at velocities of hundreds of metres per year and <b>total</b> <b>outflows</b> from the toes of a few hundreds of square metres per year. Thermal arguments show in the Nankai area that all of this large surface flow cannot come from as deep as the decollement and that consequently a significant dilution by shallow sea water convection must be present. We propose that this convection is driven by the reduced density of less saline fluid of deep origin. Thus the outflow of water of deep origin may be only a few tens of square metres per year. We note, however, that there are indications in the Barbados area of massive flow of low salinity water at depth along the decollement. These flows imply the existence of large scale non-steady-state lateral transport and require the existence of sources of low salinity water. These might include the smectite-illite trans-formation and the fluid contained in the oceanic crust. However, these sources are limited and the possibility exist that other more important sources may be required such as long distance transport of fresh water from adjacent sedimentary basins and (or) recharge mechanisms such as the seismic pumping one. 1...|$|E

Methyl PAHs (MPAHs) (149 - 221 ng/L in the influent; 29. 6 - 56. 3 ng/L in the effluent; 202 - 375 ng/g in the activated sludge), oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) (139 - 155 ng/L; 69. 9 109 ng/L; 695 - 1533 ng/g) and PAHs (372 - 749 ng/L; 182 - 241 ng/L; 2402 - 3321 ng/g) existed, but nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) were not detected. 2 -Methylnaphthalene, anthraquinone, 9 -fluorenone and 2 -methylanthraquinone were the predominant SPAHs. OPAHs were deduced to be formed from PAHs especially during summer, based on the ratios variation and removal efficiencies of the two seasons, and the surplus mass in the outflows. Low molecular weight compounds (2 - 3 rings) might be mainly removed by mineralization/transformation and adsorption in the anaerobic unit, and by volatilization in the aerobic unit. High molecular weight compounds (4 - 6 rings) might be mainly removed by adsorption in the anaerobic unit. The <b>total</b> <b>outflows</b> of SPAHs and PAHs were 66 g/d in summer and 148 g/d in winter from the WWTP to the receiving river. The percentage of OPAHs was higher in summer than in winter.

This is consistent with the standard model in which each source grows at a roughly constant rate during which time the central engine puts out a roughly constant beam power. The fact that the total source lifetimes and energies are independent of radio source size indicates that the sources are being sampled at random times during their lifetimes. 1...|$|R

40|$|In large {{aquifers}} {{relevant for}} their considerable size, regional groundwater modeling remains challenging given geologic complexity and data scarcity {{in space and}} time. The Guaraní Aquifer System is the largest transboundary aquifer in South America. It contains an enormous volume of water, however, it is not well known being difficult {{to assess the impact}} of exploitation currently used to supply over 25 million inhabitants. This is a sensitive issue because the aquifer is shared by four countries. Moreover, an integrated groundwater model, and therefore, a global water balance were not available. In this work, a transient regional scale model for the entire aquifer based upon five simplified, equally plausible conceptual models represented by different hydraulic conductivity parametrizations, is used to analyze the flow system and water balance components. Combining an increasing number of hydraulic conductivity zones and an appropriate set of boundary conditions, the hypothesis of a continuous sedimentary unit yielded errors within the calibration target in a regional sense. The magnitude of the water budget terms resulted very similar for all parametrizations. Recharge and stream/aquifer fluxes were the dominant components representing, on average, 84. 2 % of total inflows and 61. 4 % of <b>total</b> <b>outflows,</b> respectively. However, leakage was small compared to stream discharges of main rivers. For instance, the simulated average leakage for the Uruguay river was 8 m 3 s− 1 while the observed absolute minimum discharge was 382 m 3 s− 1 . Streams located in heavily pumped regions switched from a gaining condition on early years to a losing condition over time. Water is discharged through the aquifer boundaries, except at the eastern boundary. On average, pumping represented 16. 2 % of inflows while aquifer storage experienced a small overall increment. The model water balance indicates that the current rate of groundwater withdrawals does not exceed the rate of recharge on a regional sense...|$|E

A_j stands for average agricultural incomes per family and (w^p_j/w_i) for the wage differentials between regions (ken's). [w^p_j is calculated as follows: w^p_j=(Σ__in^i_jw_i-n^p_jw_p) /(Σ__in^i_j-n^p_j), where suffix p denotes "excluding any specific i. "] The term ψ is a shift variable in the above job application equation and supposed further to {{be a function of}} τ^i_j, the familiarity of the applicants in j ken with i ken, and also of θ^i_j, the order of hiring preference to the workers from j ken held by the spinners in i ken. In the proceeding analysis (Obi and Nishikawa, Mita Annals of Economics vol. 4. 1960) the ψ-effect was conveniently called as "distance effect," and identified with the accumulative numbers of in- and out-flows between i and j ken, N^i_j(t) =Σ^^ __ n^i_j(t) [o stands for any basic year]. The N^i_j may be interpreted as a crude index of past history on labor movement between i and j ken. The introduction of N^i_j instead of ψ presents us a sufficiently high and significant multiple correlation; however there still remain some gaps between our understandings and the actual course of events. It is the purpose of this second report to fill these gaps. It is supposed that ψ-ffect is composed of f_i and f_t, which are unspecified factors and represent inter-regional and inter-temporal effect, respectively. logn^i_j=f^i_j+f^i_t+a_ 1 (w^p_j/w_i) +a_ 2 A_j; i-e., a_ 3 ψ=f^i_j+f^i_t. The f^i_j-s and f^i_i-s are estimated from the inflows from j to i. As for i, Aichi (23), Hyogo (28) and Okayama (33) are selected. Our subsequent analysis is to correlate any variables X_q(_i) with f^i_j. The f^i_j-s are 1. positively correlated with M_i, <b>total</b> <b>outflows</b> from j ken, 2. positively correlated with M^i_j, outflows from j to i ken, 3. not significantly correlated with(M_j/P_j), the ratio of outflows to population. The variables M_j, M^i_j and (M_j/P_j) are considered to be alternative Indices of psychological tendencies to move out from the native area. The f^i_j-s are 4. positively correlated with R_j(t), silk reeling outflows from j ken at year t, 5. positively correlated with S_j(t), numbers of silk reeling workers employed in j ken at year t, 6. positively correlated with ΔR_j (5 - 10) and ΔS_j (5 - 10); these are decrements of R_j and S_j from S. 5 (1930) to S. 10 (1935). It is inferred according to Findings 4 ～ 6 that the decreases of job opportunity in silk reeling accerelate the outflows to spinning mills. In this context we are remined that the geographical distributions of these two industries are considerably different. The silk reeling are scattered widely ail over the country and spinning mills concentrated in 4 areas along the coast of Pacific Ocean. This characterizes the scopes of labor mobility of the workers in these industries; that is, the workers in silk reeling moved narrowly, while the workers in spinning mills moved far more long distance. Findings 4 ～ 6 are clearly observed only for inflows to Aichi (i= 23), but not for Hyogo (i= 28) and Okayama (i= 33). This is because both the two industries are highly mixed in Tokai and Tosan District, while in the other areas, the relative weight of silk reeling workers are too low to result in such high and significant correlations. Besides what mentioned above, we have reviewed some case-studies on labor market organization, undertaken by emploment offices nearly at the period in consideration...|$|E

Our CO (J= 3 - 2) map reveals that many outflows are crowded in the dense cluster-forming clump that can {{be recognized as a}} HCO^+ clump with a size of ∼ 0. 2 pc and mass of ∼ 80 M_. The clump contains several subfragments with sizes of ∼ 0. 05 pc. By comparing the CO (J= 3 - 2) map with the 1. 1 mm dust continuum image taken by AzTEC on ASTE, we find that the spatial extents of the outflow lobes are sometimes anti-correlated with the distribution of the dense gas and some of the outflow lobes apparently collide with the dense gas. The <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> mass, momentum, and energy are estimated at 0. 6 M_, 8 M_ km s^- 1, and 64 M_ km^ 2 s^- 2, respectively. The energy injection rate due to the outflows is comparable to the turbulence dissipation rate in the clump, implying that the protostellar outflows can maintain the supersonic turbulence in this region. The <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> energy seems only about 10 percent the clump gravitational energy. We conclude that the current outflow activity is not enough to destroy the whole cluster-forming clump, and therefore star formation is likely to continue for several or many local dynamical times.

3000|$|The {{data show}} {{significant}} inertia {{in all four}} states, reflected in the largest probabilities along the main diagonal, but it is notable that the conditional probabilities of movement from industry to agriculture and to services are both about twice {{the magnitude of the}} reverse probabilities, and that from industry to nonemployed is nearly three times that of the reverse movement. At the same time and consistent with the earlier finding of significant gross inflows into industry, the data show that nontrivial numbers of workers have entered industry, and from all three of the other destinations. The <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> from industry is 25.2 percent of industry employment in 1993, which is smaller than the outflow shown in Table [...]...|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} energy can be neither created nor be {{destroyed}} {{is called the}} law of conservation of energy. In {{the form of the}} first law of thermodynamics, this states that a closed system's energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by work or heat, and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.|$|R
