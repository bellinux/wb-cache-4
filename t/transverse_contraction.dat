Many desirable properties of contracting dynamics are extended to this context, including preservation of contraction under a broad class of interconnections.

Twodimensional (2 D) small-angle X-ray scattering patterns monitor the nanostructure evolution. Data evaluation methods for high-precision determination of macroscopic mechanical and nanoscopic structure parameters are presented. The hardest materials exhibit a very inhomogeneous nanodomain structure. During straining their domains {{appear to be}} wedged together and inhibit <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> on the nanometer scale. Further components are polyamides (PA 6, PA 12) (20 – 30 %) and as compatibilizer Yparex® 8102 (YP) (0 – 10 %). Some HDPE/PA 6 blends are additionally loaded with nanoclays (Nanomer® or Cloisite®). Blending of HDPE with PA 12 causes no synergistic effect. In the absence of nanoclay, PA 6 and HDPE form a heterogeneous nanostructure with high Young’s modulus. After addition of YP a more homogeneous scaffold structure is observed in which some of the PA 6 microfibrils and HDPE crystallites appear to be rigidly connected, but the modulus has decreased. Both kinds of nanoclay induce a transition from a structure without transverse correlation among the microfibrils into a macrolattice with 3 D correlations among HDPE domains from neighboring microfibrils. For extensions between 0. 7 % and 3. 5 % the scattering entities with 3 D correlation exhibit transverse elongation instead of <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction.</b> The process is interpreted as overcoming a correlation barrier executed by the crystallites in an evasion-upon-approaching mechanism.

Intermedin (IMD), a multi-functional peptide, plays important roles in cardiovascular protection. In this study, we revealed an autophagy-dependent mechanism involved in IMD’s protection against cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte death in heart hypertrophy. We observed that <b>transverse</b> aortic <b>contraction</b> (TAC) induction, Ang II or ISO exposure induced remarkable increase in the expression of endogenous IMD and its receptor components, CRLR, RAMP 1 and RAMP 3, in mouse hearts and H 9 c 2 cell cultures, respectively. Furthermore, the heart size, heart weight/body weight ratios, cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis, interstitial collagen, hypertrophic markers including ANP and BNP expression were also significantly increased, which were effectively suppressed by IMD supplementation. In addition, IMD induced capillary angiogenesis and improved functions in hypertrophic hearts. We further observed that IMD induced strong autophagy in hypertrophic hearts and cultured cells, which was paralleling with the decrease in cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis. Furthermore, an autophagy inhibitor, 3 -MA, was used to block the IMD-augmented autophagy level, and then the protection of IMD on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis was almost abrogated. We also observed that IMD supplementation stirred intracellular cAMP production, and augmented the ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation induced by Ang II/ISO exposure in H 9 c 2 cells.

5000|$|An {{essential}} {{feature of}} many cells is {{their ability to}} migrate towards certain mechanical (Durotaxis) or chemical (Chemotaxis) stimuli. Cell migration takes place through the concerted action of three Rho family GTPases: Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. When GTP-bound, Rac will cause the formation of lamellipodia, and Cdc42 will cause the formation of filopodia, thus promoting cell migration. In the migrating cell, there are three main types of stress fibers: ventral stress fibers, transverse arcs, and dorsal stress fibers. [...] Ventral stress fibers are associated with focal adhesions at both ends, are located on the ventral surface of the cell, and function in adhesion and <b>contraction.</b> <b>Transverse</b> arcs are not directly linked to focal adhesions, and typically flow from {{the leading edge of}} the cell, back towards the cell centre. Dorsal stress fibers are located at the trailing edge of the cell. They attach to focal adhesions on the ventral surface of the trailing edge, and extend dorsally, towards the cell centre to attach to transverse arcs. During cell migration, actin filaments within stress fibers will be recycled by a process of retrograde actin flow. The mechanism of dissolution of the focal adhesion itself is poorly understood.|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{the modes}} of a {{multimode}} fiber forms a frontier between what is achievable with current fibre technology and what {{is required for the}} remainder of the 21 st century. Large mode area multimode fibers accommodate the high power delivery demanded by fiber lasers used in industry for precision cutting, welding and drilling functions, and used elsewhere for the generation of white light sources used in fiber communication, medical and precision time keeping applications. This thesis explores the theory of nonlinear effects in multimode fibers with the intention of optimizing existing applications, whilst simultaneously identifying new ones. A generalized multimode nonlinear Schrodinger equation is numerically solved to explore the phenomenon of self-focusing in multimode fibers, with peak powers in the megawatt regime. Temporal effects compress femtosecond pulses launched into the fundamental mode, driving peak powers up and coupling power into higher order modes; a process identified with <b>transverse</b> spatial <b>contraction</b> and increased intensity. Parameter regimes in which damage may be avoided are identified. The nonlinear interaction of two modes under continuous wave pumping is solved analytically in terms of elliptic functions. The nonlinear multi frequency dynamics describing the optical regeneration of optical communication signals are researched in a scalar single mode scenario, before nonlinear effects in polarization modes are explored. In the scalar case, a modification to a phase sensitive amplifier from the literature solves the problem of phase to amplitude noise conversion during regeneration. Improved bit error rates in three modulation formats are simulated as a result and experimental collaboration demonstrates proof of principle. Polarization assisted phase sensitive amplification (PAPSA) for signal regeneration is then introduced. Polarization mode benefits include operating power and fiber length reduction, simultaneous regeneration of signal phase and amplitude, and a simple way to decompose the signal into quadrature and in-phase components. An approximate analytic theory of PAPSA is developed. Experimental collaboration demonstrates that PAPSA offers significant signal bit error rate reduction<br/...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment.

40|$|Overall Clinical Bottom Line: After a {{complete}} appraisal of nine articles, {{we conclude that}} the addition of rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) to traditional methods of teaching muscle <b>contractions</b> (<b>transverse</b> abdominis (TrA), multifidus, pelvic floor and external anal sphincter) utilizing verbal and tactile cueing is no more beneficial in enhancing retention of these skills in symptomatic (low back pain, pelvic floor dysfunction or fecal incontinence) subjects. From these articles, {{we were unable to}} deduce if RUSI enhanced restoration of function (pain and/or continence) more than traditional techniques alone. However, evidence supported the use of RUSI in asymptomatic subjects for retaining the ability to perform a multifidus muscle contraction both seven days and four weeks after training. Due to the lack of evidence that RUSI significantly enhances acquisition and retention of the desired muscle contractions in symptomatic subjects, the benefits of RUSI currently do not mitigate the high cost of RUSI equipment. However, no harm has been reported using RUSI. If RUSI equipment were readily available in a clinic, we would utilize it to re-educate muscles during the cognitive phase of learning. Clinical Scenario: We have been treating patients with lumbar instability and pelvic floor dysfunction. Our primary teaching methods have included verbal and tactile cueing to facilitate the proper muscle contractions and to provide patients with knowledge of results. We recently learned about using RUSI to provide visual feedback to facilitate acquisition of these contractions (TrA, multifidus, and pelvic floor muscles). We {{would like to know if}} the literature supports the use of RUSI over traditional verbal and tactile feedback to facilitate retention of performing the desired muscle contraction and to help decrease pain and disability...|$|R

Study design: 58 women with stress, urge or mixed urinary incontinence participated in the study. Individual treatment programs were selected according to the dysfunction evaluated by vaginal palpation and perineal ultrasound. 22 women in group 1 were treated by electrical stimulation followed by an EMG-assisted PFMT program including training at home for 2 - 12 months (median 3). 36 women in group 2 received 1 - 6 (median 2) clinical visits and followed a specific pelvic floor rehabilitation program. The program consisted of pelvic floor and transverse abdominal muscle pre-contraction, coordination training, sustained submaximal contractions and its integration into daily life. Training was supervised by a specialized physiotherapist in each group. A validated pelvic floor questionnaire was completed by all women before and after treatment and additional validated improvement and satisfaction scales assessed patient-centered outcome. Follow-up time was 5 - 16 months (median 10. 5 in group 1 and median 7. 0 in group 2). Results: Stress and urge urinary incontinence symptoms were reduced in 40 - 45 % (group 1) and 44 - 47 % (group 2). Bladder function domain scales improved significantly in both groups. The burden of suffering due to symptoms of urinary incontinence decreased in 50 % (group 1) and 66 %, respectively (group 2). 50 % in group 1 stated they had better perception of their pelvic floor muscles resulting in more satisfaction with treatment.

40|$|Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) are {{subjected}} to pulsatile strain due to pressure changes in the cardiac cycle and this may {{play a significant role}} in vascular function in health and disease. Further, ECs differentially respond to different patterns of strain. There is much evidence that cyclic uniaxial strain results in a perpendicular orientation of ECs and their stress fibers, while no such alignment occurs in response to cyclic equaibiaxial stretch. It is unclear how cells and their stress fibers determine their specific response to particular spatiotemporal changes in the matrix, however. Given that ECs located at regions in the arterial tree prone to atherogenesis are non-aglined, while ECs in relatively healthy regions are oriented perpendicular to the principal direction of cyclic stretch, it is important to understand the mechanisms which regulate stretch-induced stress fiber alignment. The focus of this thesis was to develop realistic models to describe the dynamic changes in the organization of stress fibers in response to diverse spatiotemporal patterns of stretch. The model is based on the premise that stress fibers are pre-stressed at a ?homeostatic? level so that stress fibers are extended beyond their unloaded lengths, and that perturbation in stress fiber length from the homeostatic level destabilizes the stress fibers. A deterministic model described experimentally measured time courses of stress fiber reorientation perpendicular to the direction of cyclic uniaxial stretch, as well as the lack of alignment in response to equibiaxial stretch. In the case of cyclic simple elongation with <b>transverse</b> matrix <b>contraction,</b> stress fibers oriented in the direction of least perturbation in stretch. Model analysis indicated the need for a time-dependent stress fiber mechanical property, however. Thus, a stochastic model was developed that incorporated the concept that stress fibers tend to self-adjust to an equilibrium level of extension when they are perturbed from their unload lengths with the turnover of stress fibers. The stochastic model successfully described experimentally measured time courses of stress fiber reorganization over a range of frequencies. At a frequency of 1 Hz, stress fibers predominantly oriented perpendicular to stretch, while at 0. 1 Hz the extent of stress fiber alignment was markedly reduced and at 0. 01 Hz there was no alignment at all. Both the deterministic and stochastic models accurately described the relationship between stretch magnitude and the extent of stress fiber alignment in endothelial cells subjected to cyclic uniaxial stretch. Parameter sensitivity analyses for each model were used to demonstrate the effects of each parameter on the characteristics of the system response. In summary, the mathematical models were capable of describing stress fiber reorganization in response to diverse temporal and spatial patterns of stretch. These models provide a theoretical framework to elucidate the mechanisms by which adherent cells sense the characteristics of matrix deformation and describe a mechanism by which the cells can then adapt to such deformations to maintain mechanical homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|Overview: Optical {{concepts}} {{as they relate}} to the ophthalmologic correction of vision in corneal laser vision correction and intraocular lens design was examined. Purpose: The interaction between the excimer laser and residual corneal tissue in laser vision correction produces unwanted side effects. Understanding the origin of these artifacts can lead to better procedures. Furthermore, accommodating intraocular lenses offer a potential for eliminating presbyopia. Understanding the properties of a new accommodating intraocular lens incorporating a deformable interface may lead to advances in cataract surgery. Introduction: Corneal surface irregularities following laser refractive procedures are commonly seen. They regularly result in a patient’s decreased best corrected visual acuity and decreased contrast sensitivity. These changes are only seen in biologic tissue and the etiology has been elusive. A thermal response has been theorized and was investigated in this research. In addition, intraocular lenses using a mechanically deforming interface to change their power in order to duplicate natural accommodation have been developed. The deforming interface(s) induce optical aberrations due to irregular deformations. Design efforts have centered on minimizing these deformations. Both of the ophthalmic applications have been analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA) to understand their inherent optical properties. Methods: FEA modeling of thermal theory has been applied to verify that excimer laser induced collagen contraction creates corneal surface irregularities and central islands. A mathematical model which indicates the viability of the theory was developed. The modeling results were compared to post ablation changes in eyes utilizing an excimer (ArF 193 nm), as well as non-ablative thermal heating in eyes with a CO₂ laser. Addition modeling was performed on an Intraocular lens prototype measuring of actuation force, lens power, interface contour, optical transfer function, and visual Strehl ratio. Prototype verified mathematical models were utilized to optimize optical and mechanical design parameters to maximize the image quality and minimize the required force. Results: The predictive model shows significant irregular central buckling formation and irregular folding. The amount of collagen contraction necessary to cause significant surface changes is very small (0. 3 %). Uniform scanning excimer laser ablation to corneal stroma produces a significant central steepening and peripheral flattening in the central 3 mm diameter. Isolated thermal load from uniform CO₂ laser irradiation without ablation also produces central corneal steepening and paracentral flattening in the central 3 mm diameter. The iterative mathematical modeling based upon the intraocular lens prototype yielded maximized optical and mechanical performance through varied input mechanical and optical parameters to produce a maximized visual Strehl ratio and a minimized force requirement. Conclusions: The thermal load created by laser irradiation creates a characteristic spectrum of morphologic changes on the porcine corneal stromal surface which correlates to the temperature rise and is not seen inorganic, isotropic material. The highly similar surface changes seen with both lasers are likely indicative of temperature induced <b>transverse</b> collagen fibril <b>contraction</b> and stress re-distribution. Refractive procedures which produce significant thermal load should be cognizant of these morphological changes. The optimized intraocular lens operates within the physiologic constraints of the human eye including the force available for full accommodative amplitude using the eye’s natural focusing feedback, while maintaining image quality in the space available. Optimized optical and mechanical performance parameters were delineated as those which minimize both asphericity and actuation pressure. The methodology combines a multidisciplinary basic science approach from biomechanics, optical science, and ophthalmology to optimize an intraocular lens design suitable for preliminary trials...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} model of fan noise caused by inflow turbulence, a generalization of earlier work by Mani, is presented. Axisymmetric turbulence theory {{is used to}} develop a statistical representation of the inflow turbulence valid {{for a wide range}} of turbulence properties. Both the dipole source due to rotor blade unsteady forces and the quadrupole source resulting from the interaction of the turbulence with the rotor potential field are considered. The effects of variations in turbulence properties and fan operating conditions are evaluated. For turbulence axial integral length scales much larger than the blade spacing, the spectrum is shown to consist of sharp peaks at the blade passing frequency and its harmonics, with negligible broadband content. The analysis can then be simplified considerably and the total sound power contained within each spectrum peak becomes independent of axial length scale, while the width of the peak is inversely proportional to this parameter. Large axial length scales are characteristic of static fan test facilities, where the <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> of the inlet flow produces highly anisotropic turbulence.

40|$|The {{correction}} {{of the classical}} Doppler formula by the time dilation factor gives the currently admitted relativistic Doppler equation. When the source path is not collinear {{to that of the}} receiver, this correction gives a transverse wave dilation whose possible detection was considered by Einstein as an ideal mean to prove the time dilation of special relativity. It is suggested here that this elusive effect whose measurement remains controversial, could in fact be absent from relativistic as well as classical contexts, but that this absence paradoxically proves the time-dilation of special relativity. An intuitive reasoning using parallel Doppler effects is first proposed to conceive why the absence of a wave carrier medium imposes time dilation for electomagnetic waves. A rational reconstruction of the non-collinear Doppler effect is then presented using only reciprocal quantities such as the source-receiver distance. This rigorous analysis reveals a virtual equation whose <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> effect is exactly cancelled by the relativistic time dilation.

An increase in the steel stress affects the difference in the elongation between the reinforcing steel and concrete and causes additional slip to occur. This slip is the main cause of the increase in crack size. Slip occurs in the vicinity of a crack and extends to a point where the differential strain is zero. At that point the bond stress and resistance to slip reach maximum values and decrease toward the mid-point between cracks. The overall values of bond force decrease with an increase in load. This decrease is attributed to (a) the effects of the increase in <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> of the reinforcing bar (i.e., Poisson effect) and (b) the deterioration of the concrete at the concrete-steel interface (Odman 1962). Therefore, the crack width increases while the crack spacing remains constant. If the load is increased further, the slip between concrete and reinforcement continues to increase. Due to the comparatively low values of concrete extensibility, the increase in crack width can be considered essentially equal to the accumulation of the slip between adjacent cracks.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The wear {{resistance}} and friction reducing properties of polymer fibres {{can be improved}} with negative Poisson’s ratio behaviour. Poisson’s ratio {{is defined as the}} ratio of <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction of stretching force. Large number of materials have positive Poisson’s ratio, however there are some materials which exhibit negative Poisson’s ratio, they are termed auxetic materials. Auxetic materials present unique property that they expand in all directions when they are stretched and contract when compressed. This paper has highlighted, compared and discussed the variation between the modelling, theoretical and practical differences of auxetic materials wear behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: For the purpose of this work, auxetic and conventional fibres were produced by the melt spinning mechanism using extruder. The fibres physical properties were evaluated such as Poisson’s ratio, fibre count, elongation, force and tenacity. Mono-filament fibres were used for fabrication of weft knitted fabrics; plain (1 x 1) structure was employed for knitting fabric. The {{wear resistance}} of the knitted fabrics were tested by using Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester and comparison were made. Findings: The abrasive wear test results demonstrated that the auxetic based weft knitted fabrics have superior wear behaviour than the conventional fibre based weft knitted fabrics. Practical implications: The experiment showed that the auxetic material is capable of sustaining large amount of abrasion compared to conventional fabric. Originality/value: The paper compare and discusse the variation between the modelling, theoretical and practical differences of auxetic materials wear behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The article {{represents}} a summarized methodology {{of the research}} into small-size pilot metal samples of restored construction facilities. In the article, the co-authors demonstrate an option that provides for the analytical identification of standard characteristic values of mechanical properties, based on initial hardness HRB and conversion of hardness values using the Brinell test. Towards this end, analytical dependence of HB hardness on HRB and HRC is proposed. The numerical identification of the temporary resistance to tensile stress σ в required the pre-setting {{of the value of}} the average coefficient of relative elongation. This average coefficient was employed to identify the values of relative elongation and contraction, as well as the yield value of the metal. Standard plasticity and strength values were employed to compile an equation for complex criterion C. This criterion was employed to identify the value of relative uniform elongation and <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction,</b> and both were employed to assess the resistance to tensile stress and fatigue. The optical microscopy method was used to identify the pilot sample of the metal as structural carbon steel having grade C 15. Its strength analysis based on the properties of its structural components has proven the identity between the sample metal and the aforementioned steel grade. The method proposed by the co-authors helps to identify the metals of restructured construction facilities on the basis of small-size samples to avoid the collapse of metal structures...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To apply both {{conventional}} cephalometric {{analysis and}} morphometric analysis (thin-plate spline analysis) to posteroanterior (PA) cephalograms {{to test the}} hypothesis that the dentoskeletal features of subjects with anterior open bite in the mixed dentition are no different from those of normal controls. Materials and Methods: A group of 22 white subjects (6 males, 16 females; mean age, 8. 7 +/- 0. 7 years) with anterior open bite (AOBG) was compared with a control group (CG) of 22 white subjects (11 males, 11 females; mean age, 9. 2 +/- 0. 8 years) with Class I occlusal relationships, and without anterior open bite and sucking habits. Subjects of both groups were in the mixed dentition and had no history of orthodontic treatment. Between-group statistical comparisons were performed with independent sample t-tests and permutation tests. Results: AOBG exhibited statistically significant shape differences with respect to CG that consisted of a <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> of the zygomatic region, of the maxilla (at both skeletal and dentoalveolar levels), and of the mandible (in both condylar and gonial regions), with a downward dislocation of point menton. With conventional cephalometrics, AOBG showed a statistically significant transverse deficiency in the zygomatic region (- 4. 8 mm), in the maxilla at both skeletal and dentoalveolar levels (- 2. 0 mm and - 3. 0 mm, respectively), and in the mandible in both condylar and gonial regions (- 3. 6 mm and - 4. 0 mm, respectively). Conclusion: Subjects with anterior open bite showed transverse deficiencies in the zygomatic region, in the maxilla, and in the mandible when compared with normal subjects.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{revealed}} that whether it is early distresses in asphalt pavement or not depends largely on working performance of base. In the field of asphalt pavement, it is widely accepted that lean concrete base, compared with the general semi-rigid base, has better working performance, such as high strength and good eroding resistance. Problem of early distresses in asphalt pavement, which caused by more traffic loadings, can be settled effectively when lean concrete is used in asphalt pavement. Traffic loading is important parameter used {{in the analysis of}} the new pavement design. However, few studies have done extensive and intensive research on the load stress for asphalt pavement of lean concrete base. Because of that, it is necessary to study the load stress for the asphalt pavement. In the paper, first of all, three–dimension finite element model of the asphalt pavement is created for the aim of doing mechanical analysis for the asphalt pavement. And then, the two main objectives of this study are investigated. One is analysis for load stress of lean concrete base, and the other is analysis for load stress of asphalt surface. The results show that load stress of lean concrete base decreases, decrease and increase with increase of base's thickness, surface's thickness and ratio of base's modulus to foundation's modulus respectively. So far as the asphalt surface is concerned, maximum shearing stress, which is caused by load, is evident in asphalt surface which is located in <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> joint of lean concrete base of asphalt pavement. Maximum shearing stress decrease, decrease, decrease and increase respectively with increase of the surface's modulus, the surface's thickness, base's thickness and ratio of base's modulus to foundation's modulus...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – {{to study}} histomorphometric {{characteristics}} and pathogenic mechanism of peroneal nerve neuropathy in experimental lower leg lengthening by one millimeter {{per day in}} four increments. Methods. The authors performed lengthening of lower leg in 12 adult mongrel dogs at 14 - 15 % of initial length by Ilizarov technique. 28 days after the leg distraction, 30 days after its fixation in the device and 30 days after the Ilizarov fixator dismounting the authors withdrew the animals from the experiment. Peroneal nerve portions were examined using light microscopy, histomorphometry of the full-color images of the giant epoxy semifine sections stained with methylene blue and diamond fuchsin. Results. Planimetric investigation demonstrated 15 % decrease (p< 0. 05) in the total area of nerve fiber bundles after distraction confirming <b>transverse</b> <b>contraction</b> of intrafascicular content. Fibrosis, increased cellularity of epineurium {{as well as the}} decrease in adipocyte number and size was observed in result of distraction and fixation. Neuropathy of the peroneal nerve was observed in one of the 12 animals – more than 80 % of myelinated fibers demonstrated destructive changes, the large arteries of epineurium demonstrated obliterated lumina, part of arteries had necrobiotic changes in the cellular elements of the walls. In the remaining animals the proportion of the transformed myelinated fibers in the experiment time frame amounted to 6. 0 ± 1. 4 %, 4. 3 ± 1. 3 % and 4. 2 ± 0. 4 % (normally: 1. 9 ± 0. 3 %), no marked vascular damage was observed, the number of epineural vascular modules increased up to 6. 0 ± 1. 5 (contralaterally – up to 4. 0 ± 1. 6), the number of endoneural microvessels was increased at 35. 5 %, 10. 9 % and 38. 9 % (p< 0. 05) in respect of intact norm (141. 8 ± 8. 7 per 1 mm 2). Reduced proportion of capillaries with open lumina confirmed vasomotion disorder. The changes analysis in the distribution of myelinated fibers by diameter and mean size indicates the distinct axonal atrophy, deand re-myelinaton. The mean diameter of axons and myelin thickness remained respectively 7 % and 14 % below normal (p< 0. 05) in 30 days after the fixator dismounting. Conclusion. Good structural preservation of the majority of peroneal nerve fibers during leg lengthening in the manual fractural mode is ensured by integrity and hypervascularization of the nerve membranes. Axonal atrophy and hypomyelination observed in part of the fibers is associated with epineurium thinning due to decreased adipocytes content and their size. Histologically documented neuropathy was observed in one case of twelve along with lumina obliteration of main epineural arteries...|$|E
