5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film.

When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings.

40|$|Recently many process {{modelling}} approaches have been developed.

40|$|Any {{processor}} {{is said to}} be optimally performing if it has {{a higher}} throughput, low waiting time, low turn around time, and less number of context switches for <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> coming for execution. The scheduler is the component which is responsible for taking the decision on how and when to schedule <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> waiting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ready queue for their chance to get the CPU.
