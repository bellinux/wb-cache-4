500|$|The Friends of Malvern Springs and Wells is an {{informal}} group that publishes a newsletter and promotes {{interest in the}} wells, including an award scheme for conservation or renovation of springs and wells and their immediate environment. The award scheme is the St Werstan Award for the Enhancement of Water Heritage, given in honour of St. Werstan, {{one of the earliest}} saints associated with Malvern. In August 2008, the group's St Werstan award for conservation or renovation of the springs and wells and their surroundings was presented to Coca-Cola Great Britain. At the behest of the Friends, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> sponsoring a project to transfer an iconic mulberry tree sapling from Melbourne, Australia. The sappling derives from a cutting taken from a mulberry tree originally planted in 1936 by George Bernard Shaw at the Malvern Festival. The tree was destroyed in a storm in 2000, but research by members of the Friends group revealed that in 1956, a cutting from the tree was sent to Malvern in Victoria, Australia. The Friends group also assists in the general maintenance of wells and spouts, and in organising events and well dressing ceremonies. According to research made by local historians, a tradition of well dressing in the Malverns dates from the 12th and 13th centuries when around 5 August each year, tribute was paid to St Oswald for water cures. The tradition of well dressing continues, fostered by interest groups and activities such as arts projects.|$|E
