500|$|Her first {{starring}} film {{role was}} in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, in which she played a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears {{for much of the}} film, Nichols said, [...] "When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> altered! Nichols {{said in an interview that}} among the rules established in her contract were: [...] "I will not get wet and show nipples" [...] in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the [...] "Marilyn Monroe dress" [...] she wore in the film. She said, [...] "I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise." [...] P2 was generally disliked by critics. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was [...] "admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability." [...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable." ...|$|E

You would be fifty yards from shore all the time when you ought to be within fifty feet of it. You can't see a snag in one of those shadows, but you know exactly where it is, and the shape of the river tells you when you are coming to it. Then there's your pitch-dark night; the river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark night from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem to be straight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you'd RUN them for straight lines only you know better. You boldly drive your boat right into {{what seems to be a}} solid, straight wall (you knowing very well that in reality there is a curve there), and that wall falls back and makes way for you. Then there's your gray mist. You take a night when there's one of these grisly, drizzly, gray mists, and then there isn't any particular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle the head of the oldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds of MOONLIGHT change the shape of the river in different ways. You see--' ...|$|E

The studio was also chosen to design the 31 sports pictograms, the Olympic torch, safety lantern, traveling cauldron, the Olympic medals, and a commemorative poster.

[...] Kay argued that cystic fibrosis, although it has a much higher rate of occurrence in caucasian males, affects all races and both genders. Kay also pointed out that many charity events raise money for breast cancer, even though it is primarily a female disease, and for Tay-Sachs, whose sufferers are almost exclusively Jewish. Editorial and opinion articles from the Ottawa Citizen have also condemned CUSA's actions with the editorial declaring that [...] "when student association does something as ignorant and thoughtless as Carleton University's did this week, the country pays attention." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sexy Beast was the {{beginning}} of a new phase for me of working with first time filmmakers. Jonathan Glazer was a television commercials director in the UK, and a wonderful talent. We were sent this script which he was attached to, and out came this wonderful film. It was very stimulating having a first time talent... The dialogue as you see in this film is exceptional. I had never read a script like it, and I thought, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made. It was very difficult to get insurance on the film actually. When the American studio bought the film, their legal department said: [...] "You cannot make this." [...] It has something like 300 uses of the word [...] "cunt", and 400 [...] "fucks", but somehow it passed the censorship and got out there.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} this was that a legal {{challenge}} had been made that Super Audio discs contain up to three complete recordings of a work: one in the Hybrid CD compatible layer, and two in the SACD layer, a stereo version and a possible multiple channel version. If this is true, record companies could be legally liable {{for up to three}} sets of royalties. Since this would make the record much more expensive, it appears that most companies are avoiding this issue by simply canceling the release of the SACD version.Kooper said, [...] "Have finished an eye-opening 5.1 Surround SACD mix of Super Session. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the finest way to listen to music if it is prepared correctly. So many people are doing it in the digital domain and losing the sonics of the sixties, as it were." [...] Kooper used as much analog technology as he could. [...] "Both these CDs were approached with their original bravado will be great demonstrators of SACD 5.1 Surround systems. So have patience and it will be rewarded in March 2004 (hopefully)." [...] However, this date passed without the album being released.|$|E
5000|$|Bowie {{was pleased}} that the band members clicked, calling the ease at which the personalities came {{together}} [...] "inspired guesswork". Hunt and Tony, the two sons of comic Soupy Sales, kept the mood jovial during recording sessions and interviews. Bowie later rejected the idea that Reeves, Hunt and Tony were backing members of his band. [...] "The Sales brothers would never accept having another boss. They are far too stubborn and aware of their own needs. They're not in the market to be anybody's backing band, either of them. You do not fuck with the Sales brothers, or Reeves Gabrels." [...] Gabrels said that Bowie came in one day while the group was first forming and said, [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a band. Everybody's got input. Everybody's writing. You guys don't listen to me anyway." [...] The band split profits four ways, no one was on a salary and each member paid for his own expenses. Bowie also clarified that [...] "the band will cease to exist the moment it ceases to be a musical experience for any of us. None of us {{wanted to get into}} the kind of situation where you find yourself making albums because you're contracted to." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shea later elborated:Before I did STRIPPED TO KILL you {{had never}} seen a girl dancing on a pole, no one had ever seen that in a movie, to my knowledge. Girls {{swinging}} around on a pole--that had not been done yet. So I think that was spectacular; it was crazy, it was wild. This is how it happened. I went to a strip club {{for the first time in}} my life and I saw a girl swinging around on a pole and I thought, ‘Oh my god <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a movie!’ I mean, nobody knows this goes on except a bunch of guys with dollar bills, so it just had to be exploited, I guess. I thought they were very artistic and I just loved the girls, they were real artists and they were just using this particular venue to explore their art.She took the idea to Roger Corman for whom she had made a number of movies as an actor. Corman says he liked the basic idea but questioned the believability of a scene where a man went undercover as a stripper. Shea brought in a female impersonator to see Corman and had him describe to the producer who to pretend to be a stripper. [...] "He Corman turned every shade," [...] recalls Shea.

And coupled with Scott Hutchison's vocals, the whole thing just kills me." [...] The band would later go on to support Death Cab for Cutie on their November UK tour. Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil stated in an October 2008 interview that [...] "The Modern Leper" [...] was his favourite song of the year, and Frightened Rabbit were soon announced as the main support during their December tour: [...] "We're incredibly excited {{to tell you that}} we'll be joined in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, by the quite brilliant Frightened Rabbit, whose album The Midnight Organ Fight {{is one of the best}} albums of this year. Utterly fantastic. Check it out. Now." [...] Fightstar vocalist and guitarist, Charlie Simpson, claimed the band [...] "are by far the best thing I have heard for about as long as I can remember" [...] and heaped praise on the album by adding [...] "it's simply crammed to the brim with beautiful melodies and lyrics so poignant, they keep you thinking about what has been said long after the songs have stopped playing. There must be something in the water up in Scotland because <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the best records I have heard since Aereogramme's debut release". Jim Adkins of Jimmy Eat World posted a blog on the band's official MySpace citing that: [...] "The Midnight Organ Fight was my favorite album of the year.

Moore told The Boot that the song was written in about 20 minutes. Moore says, [...] "One of us just started rambling, {{and the other one}} started playing the groove of it. Some songs you write and know it's a really good song, then some of them you get into the studio and it comes to life then. This was one of those songs.
