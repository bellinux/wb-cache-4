5|$|In April 2010 {{airspace}} {{all over}} Europe was affected, with many flights cancelled-which was unprecedented-due {{to the presence}} of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. On 15 April 2010 the Finnish Air Force halted <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines of one of its Boeing F-18 Hornet fighters. On 22 April 2010 UK RAF Typhoon <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet's engines. In June 2011 there were similar closures of airspace in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, following the eruption of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, Chile.|$|E
5|$|During {{their service}} with the RAAF, the Phantoms were {{operated}} alongside the RAAF's Dassault Mirage III fighters and the Royal Australian Navy's Douglas A-4 Skyhawk ground attack aircraft. In addition to routine <b>training</b> <b>flights,</b> the Phantoms participated in major air defence exercises and also flew practice sorties against warships.

The Indian Air Force operated <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> at the airport as well. In 1985, regional airline Vayudoot commenced thrice weekly flights from Bangalore using its Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The service was inaugurated by famous Indian writer R. K. Narayan.

5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as <b>training</b> <b>flights</b> to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron to bring that unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam.|$|E
