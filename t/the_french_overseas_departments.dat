25|$|In 1958, {{the weak}} and {{unstable}} Fourth Republic {{gave way to the}} Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency. In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>{{overseas}}</b> <b>departments</b> of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion, and {{the overseas}} collectivity of Saint Martin {{are part of}} the European Union but do not form part of the Schengen Area. The EU's freedom of movement provisions apply, but each territory operates its own visa regime for non-European Economic Area (EEA), non-Swiss nationals. While a visa valid for one of these territories will be valid for all, visa exemption lists differ. A Schengen visa, even one issued by France, is not valid for these territories. A visa for Sint Maarten (which is valid for travelling to the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin) is also valid for the French side. France also has several territories which are neither part of the EU nor the Schengen Area. These are: French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, New Caledonia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna.|$|E
25|$|FRANCE: The Republic of India's most {{valuable}} European relationship {{is with the}} Republic of France. In 1998, India's first ever strategic partnership was signed with France. The strategic partnership has profited from sustained political investments made at the senior-most levels of decision making. Wide-ranging science & technology cooperation, robust engagement in defence & security matters, deep-rooted cultural ties, and a historically francophile literary & fine-arts community in India has provided solid foundations for the strategic relationship. The global reach and complete autonomy of the compact French Force de dissuasion resonates well within Indian strategic circles. Voting patterns of France & Russia in the UN Security Council (UNSC) on matters of core interest to India has endeared both countries as all-weather friends of India. Although Paris and New Delhi maintain close ties with the US, both {{have a tendency to}} perceive Washington's policies as crassly commercial and nakedly imperialist. United Arab Emirates (UAE) is host to the 13th Demi-Brigade of the French Foreign Legion besides offering logistical facilities for the French military at Air base 104 Al Dhafra and Zayed Port. The only two civilian populated remote regions of the European Union geographically located in the Indian Ocean region are <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>departments</b> of Réunion and Mayotte. Significant Franco-Indian diaspora in French overseas territories, especially the Réunionnais of Indian origin on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, has positioned France in an advantageous situation to leverage the Neighbourhood first policy and Indian Ocean outreach priorities which were announced by the government of Narendra Modi. French is the second most popular foreign language in India after English. Indian business executives perceive French language skills as a significant business facilitator in many resource-rich strategic markets located in Africa (whose 1.1 billion population in 2013 is expected to double to 2.4 billion by 2050) and South-east Asia. France is a P5 veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC). French President François Hollande travelled India on 24 January 2016 for a 3-day visit to be the chief guest at the 67th. Indian Republic Day parade in New Delhi on 26 January 2016. France is the only country to be invited a record setting 5 times to the highly symbolic national ceremonial event. The 2016 Indian Republic Day parade included the first-ever participation of foreign troops in the march-past. 124 French troops forming a detachment of French Army soldiers from the 35th. Infantry Regiment of the 7th. Armoured Brigade based in Belfort and a ceremonial military band-music contingent based in Lyon marched down Rajpath in New Delhi.|$|E
