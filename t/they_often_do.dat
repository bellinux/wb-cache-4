5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

After that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.|$|E
25|$|Because the typhus-infected lice live in clothing, the {{prevalence}} of typhus is also affected by weather, humidity, poverty and lack of hygiene. Lice, and therefore typhus, are more prevalent during colder months, especially winter and early spring. In these seasons, people tend to wear multiple layers of clothing, giving lice more places to go unnoticed by their hosts. This is particularly a problem for poverty-stricken populations as <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not have multiple sets of clothing, preventing them from practicing good hygiene habits that could prevent louse infestation.|$|E

The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths {{have their own}} households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage.

25|$|There {{are several}} romanization {{standards}} for writing Urdu with the Latin alphabet, {{though they are}} not very popular because most fall short of representing the Urdu language properly. Instead of standard romanization schemes, people on Internet, mobile phones and media often use a non-standard form of romanization which tries to mimic English orthography. The problem {{with this kind of}} romanization is that it can only be read by native speakers, and even for them with great difficulty. Among standardized romanization schemes, the most accurate is ALA-LC romanization, which is also supported by National Language Authority. Other romanization schemes are often rejected because either they are unable to represent sounds in Urdu properly, or <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not take regard of Urdu orthography, and favor pronunciation over orthography.|$|E
25|$|While {{monitoring}} and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, the EPA has been enforcing their policies regarding air quality {{over the last}} decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not provide remedy for the social and health disparities created by exposure to emissions from electric power plants.|$|E

25|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) {{describes}} a non-progressive disorder of motor function stemming from malformation or early {{damage to the}} brain. CP can manifest in many ways, given the different manner in which brain can be damaged; in common to all forms {{is the emergence of}} signs and symptoms of impairment as the child develops. However, milestones that have been accomplished and neurologic functions that have developed do not deteriorate in CP as <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> in children with A-T in the late pre-school years. Most children with ataxia caused by CP do not begin to walk at a normal age, whereas most children with A-T start to walk at a normal age even though they often “wobble” from the start. Pure ataxia is a rare manifestation of early brain damage or malformation, however, and the possibility of an occult genetic disorder of brain should be considered and sought for those in whom ataxia is the chief manif estation of CP. Children with ataxic CP will not manifest the laboratory abnormalities associated with A-T.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E
500|$|Bede is {{described}} by Michael Lapidge as [...] "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read. In the words of Charles Plummer, {{one of the best-known}} editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede's Latin is [...] "clear and limpid... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrade {{was born}} on November 3, 1989 in Gómez Palacio, Durango, Mexico, the son of Jose Andrade Salas, who is {{better known as the}} wrestler Brillante. He became part of the third {{generation}} of the Andrade family to compete in lucha libre. His grandfather, Jose Andrade, wrestled under the ring name [...] "El Moro", his father works as Brillante, his uncles wrestle or wrestled under the names Diamante/Moro III (Sergio Andrade), Zafiro/Pentagoncito (real name unrevealed), Kevin (Juan Andrade), Espanto Jr./Pentagón (Jesus Andrade), Espiritu Magico (Juan Andrade) and one of his cousins works as the current Espanto Jr. (real name unrevealed) Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre, where <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not reveal the real names of masked wrestlers, it is possible that some more of Andrade's siblings or cousins are also professional wrestlers. With his father, uncles and grandfather being involved in running a local lucha libre promotion and school in Durango Andrade began training for a professional career from an early age, initially by playing around with his father and uncles, but later began to train seriously for a career in the wrestling ring. He made his professional wrestling debut on October 3, 2003, a month before his 14th birthday, but only after his father signing a waiver for the local boxing and wrestling commission to issue him a license. He began working under the ring name Brillante Jr. in honor of his father.|$|E

2500|$|The main charge {{made against}} the buddy system as practiced {{is that it}} has been grossly overrated as a means of risk mitigation. Critics say that the buddy system acts as a crutch to give {{unjustified}} confidence to divers who individually do not have either the skills or the discipline to adequately deal with any real diving problems. This creates a situation where divers become dependent on the [...] "security blanket" [...] of being with another diver. The reality may be that the buddy diver on which many divers depend is often no better able to handle an emergency than the dependent buddy. The fostering of this false security by diving agencies that overemphasise the effectiveness of the buddy system, develops a sense of complacency in divers about their capability to deal with these problems, a capability which <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not have. This complacency holds divers back from focusing on improving their lifesaving skills and capabilities.|$|E

2500|$|Recently, {{many people}} have begun to {{question}} if the school-based programs are necessarily the most effective approach. [...] An important concern with school-based programs is that <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not reach children who do not attend school, thus ignoring {{a large amount of}} at-risk children. [...] A 2008 study by Massa et al. continued the debate regarding school-based programs. [...] They examined the effects of community-directed treatments versus school-based treatments in the Tanga Region of Tanzania. [...] A major conclusion was that the mean infection intensity of hookworm was significantly lower in the villages employing the community-directed treatment approach than the school-based approach. [...] The community-directed treatment model used in this specific study allowed villagers {{to take control of the}} child's treatment by having villagers select their own community drug distributors to administer the antihelminthic drugs. [...] Additionally, villagers organized and implemented their own methods for distributing the drugs to all children. [...] The positive results associated with this new model highlight the need for large-scale community involvement in deworming campaigns.|$|E
2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other kilovolt electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 – 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse. [...] At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. [...] The danger is that since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless. [...] Teachers and hobbyists demonstrating small Tesla coils often impress their audience by touching the high voltage terminal or allowing the streamer arcs to pass through their body.|$|E
2500|$|Like any wild animal, moose are {{unpredictable}} {{and should be}} given a respectful amount of space.

A moose that has been harassed may vent its anger on anyone in the vicinity, and <b>they</b> <b>often</b> <b>do</b> not make distinctions between their tormentors and innocent passers-by. Moose are very limber animals with highly flexible joints and sharp, pointed hooves, and are capable of kicking with both front and back legs. Unlike other large, hooved mammals, such as horses, moose can kick in all directions including sideways. Therefore, there is no safe side from which to approach. However, moose often give warning signs prior to attacking, displaying their aggression by means of body language. The maintaining of eye contact is usually the first sign of aggression, while laid-back ears or a lowered head is a definite sign of agitation. If the hairs {{on the back of the}} moose's neck and shoulders (hackles) stand up, a charge is usually imminent. The Anchorage Visitor Centers warn tourists that [...] "...a moose with its hackles raised is a thing to fear." ...|$|E
