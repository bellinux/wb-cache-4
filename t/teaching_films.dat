An often repeated story involved Arnsiger getting invited to an alley fist fight with an Eastman representative who feared losing a fortune with their silent films already in circulation.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} a marked {{increase}} in academic interest in what are sometimes referred to as ‘utility films’: audio-visual texts intended not so much for the entertainment of an audience, but rather to inform it, train it or teach it a specific skill, or to convince it of the merits of a given service or product. This attention is long overdue, because such items form part of the collective memory of several generations of viewers – much like the feature films that {{have been part of the}} media studies canon for decades. However, the research carried out so far is somewhat restricted in scope: it primarily concerns the history of production and distribution, and questions concerning pedagogical or entrepreneurial success. Much less attention has been given to the films’ textual features: the means they deploy in defending their informational, educational or commercial argument. In the absence of such studies, the image survives of very ‘formulaic’ genres, which are thought to make use of a very limited number of (highly recognisable) textual ingredients. The purpose of this dissertation is to modify this picture. The starting point for the research is a collection of (Dutch) classroom teaching films: a corpus of shorts designed to be used in support of the lesson programme of children in primary and early secondary schools. The analytical method employed is based on two conceptual pillars. The first is that films function, and therefore acquire meaning, as part of a wider configuration: the set-up of technology, text and viewing situation that some media theorists designate as a ‘dispositif’. In the case of <b>teaching</b> <b>films,</b> the screening is inextricably intertwined with the educational institution in which it takes place; therefore, this set-up is designated here as a ‘pedagogical dispositif’. The second pillar is that of textual implication, derived from the study of literary texts. Analysis in this work is based on the assumption that the rhetorical functioning of films is always a matter of somehow incorporating into the text itself the audience addressed. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first, introductory section serves the purpose of positioning the study’s research object. It explores the concept of ‘teaching film’, both in a historical sense and in a theoretical one; subsequently, it (re) delimits it, with an eye to the rhetorical analysis that follows. The second part aims to find an answer to the question of how <b>teaching</b> <b>films</b> address their viewers. It starts off with a methodological section, which explains among others how the term ‘rhetoric’ is understood. Next, there are two analytical chapters. The first deals with the ways in which <b>teaching</b> <b>films</b> motivate their viewers to stay tuned (addressing them, in the process, as film viewers), and the second gives examples of so-called ‘references to the pedagogical dispositif’ (textual elements which help position the audience as one of learners, or pupil-viewers). The latter type of features, the dissertation also argues, do not occur in all (the) <b>teaching</b> <b>films</b> (discussed), but tend become more common over time...|$|E
40|$|The study {{described}} in this dissertation was conducted during a three week period and encompassed four senior high school English classes. The data derived from the study were elicited from a pre test of knowledge and a pre treatment attitude survey; a post test of knowledge and a post treatment attitude survey and a delayed post test of knowledge. The four groups of students were given the following treatments within the Shakespearean drama unit on Hamlet: (1) Group I - Students in this group were shown four <b>teaching</b> <b>films</b> on Hamlet and read the play aloud in class with students taking parts. (2) Group 2 - Students listened to a taped recording of the play and followed along with their books. (3) Group 3 - Students in this group listened to the taped recording of the play and were shown the four <b>teaching</b> <b>films.</b> (4) Group 4 - Students in this group, which was the control group, read the play aloud in class with students taking parts. The research questions which guided the research and were addressed through the statistical analysis were as follows: (1) What significant knowledge differences, if any, exist between and among the groups receiving the non-print media treatments and that group which did not? (2) Is there a difference in appreciation (attitudes) of Shakespearean drama between the groups which received the non-print media treatments and the group which did not? The statistical {{analysis of the data}} revealed that although all groups improved on the knowledge post test, groups 1 and 2 improved the most. Attitude scores also increased for group 1. Interestingly, the difference between pre treatment and post treatment attitude scores for group 2 was negligible, and for groups 3 and 4 decreased. The following conclusions were then drawn from the statistical analysis: (1) The use of non-print media does improve knowledge of and attitude about Shakespearean drama. (2) The use of non-print media should be limited, for example, to either taped recording or film for optimum results...|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{faces of}} the French Republic, Mussolini’s Fascist Italy and the United States of America in the Twenties are totally distinct. Nevertheless, the way these countries used educational and <b>teaching</b> <b>films</b> {{at the time was}} the product of the same intention: the transmission of the founding values of their respective systems of government. These values are, in France, the inheritance of the Enlightenment, strengthened by the republican ideals stemming from the French Revolution and the state educational model created by Jules Ferry; in Italy, Mussolini’s Nationalist Postulate, and his desire to form a “New Man”, a “regenerated race” of Italians and in the US, the raising of moral standards and the affirmation of inter-culturalism in the already well implanted notion of the “American Way of Life”. Distributed in schools and educational circles, these films, today forgotten, propose a symptomatic example of state propaganda in times of peace...|$|E
40|$|Various new {{approaches}} to language teaching have been developed recently. The approach I {{am going to do}} my research on is related to language teaching viewed as one that will serve the development of the students’ cognitive skills. The thesis will not take a didactic view upon the relationship between films and language teaching, but it is rather going to put forward the idea that foreign language competence is only a step towards knowledge acquisition, and it cannot be the aim in itself. In this thesis I am going to describe a study which will primarily focus on the roles that films can play in foreign language teaching programmes, and how films may be integrated in cross-interdisciplinary education. My main objective will be to prove that films have an enhancing role both in language and subject teaching, and they can act as a mediator between the two. Furthermore, I am going to analyse relationships between language teaching/literature <b>teaching,</b> <b>films</b> and subject teaching, and to investigate the effects they play upon each other. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|E
