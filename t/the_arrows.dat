5000|$|To load, the bow {{is pointed}} toward the ground, tipped {{slightly}} clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> is placed on <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> rest or shelf. The back of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> {{is attached to the}} bowstring with the nock (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of <b>the</b> <b>arrow).</b> This step is called [...] "nocking <b>the</b> arrow". Typical <b>arrows</b> with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the [...] "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> as it passes <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> rest.|$|R

5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases the range of <b>the</b> <b>arrows.</b> These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of}} a level if enough points were collected.|$|E

5|$|Webber {{spoke to}} Formula One team owner Eddie Jordan, who {{introduced}} him to fellow Australian Paul Stoddart. Stoddart offered to underwrite the necessary $1.1million budget for Webber, {{and gave him a}} drive in his Eurobet Arrows Formula 3000 team for 2000. As a result, Webber also got his first taste of a Formula One car, completing a two-day test at Barcelona in December 1999 for <b>the</b> <b>Arrows</b> F1 team.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{was signed}} as test driver for <b>the</b> <b>Arrows</b> F1 team for 2000, and also gained {{sponsorship}} from Australian beer company Foster's whilst competing in Formula 3000. Webber took victory in round {{two of the}} season at Silverstone, and finished the series with two fastest laps and three podiums {{on his way to}} third overall—the highest position of any rookie that year. Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive <b>the</b> <b>Arrows</b> A21 car, and rejected a full contract offer for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three-day evaluation test for Benetton {{at the end of the}} year, outpacing F1 drivers Ralf Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella at Estoril. The results were good enough to earn him the test driver role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss Flavio Briatore as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning Super Nova Racing team, and despite winning at Imola, Monaco and Magny-Cours, he finished second overall to British driver Justin Wilson. Webber was replaced as test driver for Benetton for 2002 by Fernando Alonso, but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside Alex Yoong in the Stoddart-owned Minardi team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since David Brabham in 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Plunger Button: a {{fine-tuning}} device {{consisting of}} a spring-cushioned tip inside a housing. The plunger button screws through the riser so that the tip emerges above the rest. The side of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> is {{in contact with the}} tip when <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> is on <b>the</b> rest. The spring is tuned so that it allows a certain amount of movement of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> towards <b>the</b> riser on release, bringing <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> to <b>the</b> ideal [...] "centre shot" [...] location. The plunger button is used to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>arrow's</b> flex, since <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> flexes as <b>the</b> string pushes onto it with a very high acceleration, creating what is commonly known as the archer's paradox. The device is also known as a cushion plunger, pressure button, or Berger button.|$|R

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by <b>the</b> <b>arrows.</b> The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5|$|Ecclestone held BMW {{to their}} {{contract}} for the 1987 season, but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold for use by <b>the</b> <b>Arrows</b> team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the Belgian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending Australian Grand Prix, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to EuroBrun team owner Walter Brun for an unknown price.|$|E
5|$|De la Rosa and Irvine {{qualified}} in {{ninth and}} eleventh positions respectively for Jaguar; the pair {{were separated by}} Trulli in the Jordan who's engine failed on his third run {{and was unable to}} return to the pit lane to use his team's spare car. The three drivers were ahead of Villeneuve in the faster of the two BAR cars, who in turn, qualified in front of teammate Panis; both drivers struggled to find grip throughout the one-hour period. Alesi qualified in 14th position, more than four tenths of a second in front of Prost teammate Luciano Burti; the latter spun off in the circuit's stadium section which caused a yellow flag to be shown. The two were split by Zonta in the slower Jordan car who drove over a kerb at the Senna chicane on his third run of the session which lost him time and he encountered slower cars. The Benetton cars filled the ninth row of the grid with Fisichella 17th and Button 18th; the latter's car had its gearbox changed and pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a failed engine. Behind them, <b>the</b> <b>Arrows</b> drivers managed to qualify in 18th and 19th; Enrique Bernoldi qualifying ahead of Jos Verstappen. Bernoldi improved his car's handling although his potential best run was disrupted because of Button's engine failure and Verstappen spun on his final timed lap. The starting order was completed by Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques in the Minardi cars.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{powerful}} bows require arrows {{with less}} dynamic spine. (Spine is the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>arrow.)</b> Less powerful bows have less effect in deforming <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> {{as it is}} accelerated (see [...] "Euler" [...] buckling, case I) from the bow and <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> must be [...] "easier" [...] to flex around the riser of the bow before settling to its path. Conversely, powerful bows need stiffer arrows with more spine, as the bow will have a much greater bending effect on <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> as it is accelerated. An arrow with too much dynamic spine for the bow will not flex and as the string comes closer to the bow stave, <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> will be forced off to the side. Too little dynamic spine will result in <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> deforming too much and being propelled off {{to the other side}} of the target. In extreme cases, <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> may break before it can accelerate, which can be a safety hazard.|$|R

50|$|To launch <b>the</b> <b>arrow,</b> <b>the</b> thrower uses {{a length}} of string that is longer than the length of <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> itself. A knot is tied in {{one end of the}} string, and this is placed into the notch or groove in <b>the</b> <b>arrow</b> shaft. <b>The</b> rest of the string is then passed around the shaft once, and is made to align over and above the knot before being {{stretched}} down to the point end of <b>the</b> <b>arrow.</b> <b>The</b> string is tightened, ensuring that the knotted end stays within the notch, and the surplus is wound around the thrower's throwing hand. The throwing hand with the string wound around it should be near the point end of <b>the</b> <b>arrow,</b> with <b>the</b> thrower able to easily grip the end.|$|R

25|$|There are {{systematic}} ways {{of using}} the lane arrow marks and approach dots {{to make it easier}} to line up a shot, increasing consistency of hitting the pins at the correct location every time. For beginners, it also helps eliminate fear of the channels, and places the focus solely on the lane. Most bowlers are taught to utilize <b>the</b> <b>arrows,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>arrows</b> are nearer to the point where a hooking ball starts to hook back towards the pins. Other bowlers utilize the dots if they find themselves pulling their body up at the foul line (the shoulders should stay level throughout the entire approach,) as this is usually caused by them thinking that <b>the</b> <b>arrows</b> are too far out at the lane. Advanced players often use the lane boards themselves to line up shots that require them to aim between arrows.|$|E
