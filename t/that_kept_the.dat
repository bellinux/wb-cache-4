The farmers {{did not have the}} means to wash and prepare their coffee {{cherries}} to specifications in a timely manner. Buyers paid US$0.33 per kilogram, a price <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> farmers poor.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two framing choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn tune in the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> original words unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> Russians from winning were {{the delay in}} moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E

5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched three ways. The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it {{still needs to be}} studied.|$|E

5|$|With {{their victory}} over Auburn in the Iron Bowl, Alabama {{clinched}} the SEC Western Division championship and qualified to play Georgia in the 2012 SEC Championship Game where they defeated the Bulldogs 32–28. After each team traded punts on their opening possessions, Christian Robinson recovered an AJ McCarron fumble for the Bulldogs and gave Georgia possession at the Alabama 40-yard line. The Crimson Tide defense then held the Bulldogs to a 50-yard field goal attempt that was missed by Marshall Morgan <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> game scoreless.|$|E

5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} third quarter, Alabama scored their first {{touchdown}} of the game. It came on a 68-yard T. J. Yeldon run and gave the Crimson Tide a 16–0 lead. Each team again traded punts before the Alabama defense stopped an Ole Miss scoring opportunity on a fourth-and-two play from their own seven-yard line <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> score 16–0. In the fourth, Cody Mandell had a punt downed at the Rebels' one-yard line and on the next play, C. J. Mosley sacked Ole Miss quarterback Bo Wallace for a safety and an 18–0 lead. On the next offensive play for Alabama after they received the safety kick, Kenyan Drake scored on a 50-yard touchdown run that made the final score 25–0. The shutout was the first for the Rebels since their loss against Arkansas in 1998. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels to 47–9–2 (51–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons {{had trouble}} moving {{the ball at}} first, but were helped by a 15-yard {{personal}} foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down. Weiss completed a pass that gave the Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory. On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss made up for his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line. Tennessee resumed running out the clock via short runs up {{the middle of the field}} <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> game clock ticking down. After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E

5|$|Steve Cotterill {{was drafted}} in as Thordarson's {{replacement}} {{before the start}} of the 2002–03 season. Cotterill quit in October 2002, after only four months in charge, to take the role of Howard Wilkinson's assistant at Sunderland. The club were close to unveiling George Burley as their new manager after Cotterill's departure; however, a last minute charge of heart led the former Ipswich manager to decline the club's offer. The club acted swiftly and Tony Pulis was appointed as Stoke's new manager shortly afterwards. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation with a 1–0 win over Reading on the final day of the season <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> club in the First Division. The club's position in the league was consolidated in 2003–04. Pulis was sacked at the end of the 2004–05 season, following a disagreement between himself and the club's owners. Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp broke the club's transfer record in signing Sambegou Bangoura for a fee in the region of £1m. Another significant addition was the signing of Belgium international Carl Hoefkens, who subsequently won the Fans' Player of the Year Award for the 2005–06 season. Despite his spending on new players, Boskamp's side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. The season was marred by a feud between Boskamp and the club's director of football, John Rudge, which escalated to the point where Boskamp threatened to quit. Boskamp left at the end of the 2005–06 season, amidst a takeover by former chairman Peter Coates.|$|E
5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second timeout in order to stop the game clock from ticking down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the short run, Tech was forced to call the timeout. Following the timeout, the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a short run. Another short run brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final timeout to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other way to stop the clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and the referees stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E
