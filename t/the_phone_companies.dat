50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1996, {{competition}} among the ILEC and CLECs was getting rough, and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> began to offer virtual points of presence: they would trunk in phone lines to a central location which offered a telephone prefix which was local to various {{other parts of the}} city, which allowed customers to dial into a phone line which was in their local (untimed) calling radius without forcing the ISPs to operate remote POPs, physical offices with networking gear and modems, in various places around the city {{just to be able to}} offer customers local dialin numbers.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> in North America did, in fact, replace {{all their}} hardware. They didn't {{do it to}} stop the phreaks, but simply {{as a matter of}} course while moving to fully digital {{switching}} systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling. Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The {{court ruled}} that phone users had no {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy that would give them Fourth Amendment rights. Citing the 1979 Smith v. Maryland decision as precedent, the court found that, under the Fourth Amendment, individuals have no expectation of privacy for information they provide to third parties, like phone companies. Because all the data collected by the NSA is voluntarily revealed to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> by users, they cannot expect it to remain private. They find no reason Smith v. Maryland (1979), which found that similar phone metadata was outside the expectation of privacy, would {{not apply to the}} NSA's program.|$|E

5000|$|Telephone users, in sum, {{typically}} {{know that}} they must convey numerical information to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> company; that <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> has facilities for recording this information; and that <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> does in fact record this information {{for a variety of}} legitimate business purposes. Although subjective expectations cannot be scientifically gauged, it is too much to believe that telephone subscribers, under these circumstances, harbor any general expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret.|$|R
50|$|Originally, per-minute billing was {{provided}} by phone companies (in the U.S., using 976, then 900 numbers). There was, from some services, an attempt to keep the caller aroused but short of orgasm, so he would spend more money. (This attitude still survives among some providers.) When public (mostly female) pressure forced <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> to stop providing this service to sex workers, a transition was made to a manual method: pre-paid blocks of time, 10, 30, 60 minutes, whatever the customer would pay for. The incentives for providers were then reversed; rather than earning money from keeping the customer on the line (orgasm delayed), they earned more from bringing the caller to orgasm quickly, so as to move on rapidly to another call. Unused minutes were rarely usable on a second call. The provider provided (say) 10 minutes of service, but got to keep {{all of the money}} (say 20 minutes).|$|E
5000|$|Before {{this could}} be done, the {{telephone}} company had to agree to allow {{the use of the}} device across the telephone lines. At that time the phone company owned the phone lines and all telephones (which were rented to consumers), and they opposed this new technology. Bill Saks, Andrew's son, said [...] "people don't realize it, but Ma Bell had absolute control over how her instruments were used, and there were draconian consequences for [...] [...] [...] attaching anything to their devices. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> were the Goliaths. Those three gentlemen were the Davids." [...] Marsters and other deaf advocates had to go to Washington to lobby for TTY communication to become legalized.Four years later in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission required AT&T to allow the use of the devices provided they did not cause problems to the phone company's operations. This removed the last obstacle to what became a deaf telecommunications revolution.|$|E
5000|$|On January 23, 2014, {{the board}} {{released}} its report, recommending the US end bulk data collection.

But there would be no storehouse, private or public, of telephone data beyond what <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> keep {{in the course of their}} normal business activities. [...] The report concluded that the program [...] "lacks a viable legal foundation". [...] It concluded [...] "we see little evidence that the unique capabilities provided by the NSA's bulk collection of telephone records actually have yielded material counterterrorism results that could not have been achieved without the NSA's Section 215 program." [...] The report concluded: “Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government’s efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The first solicitors to win {{financial}} settlements {{for their}} clients for phone hacking {{had to deal with}} the Met as an obstacle rather than a resource. In some cases, the Met's failure to notify potential victims in a timely manner resulted in their having to pay their own solicitors to simply find out whether they had been victims of phone hacking crimes. [...] George Galloway, a member of Parliament, was alerted by a detective that his messages had been hacked in August 2006. Galloway said the detective urged him to change his PIN code. But when Galloway asked who had accessed his phone, the man from Scotland Yard “refused to tell me anything." [...] In most cases, the failure to notify delayed or even precluded legal action by victims against perpetrators. Some possible hacking victims said that [...] "by sitting on the evidence for so long, the police have made it impossible to get information from phone companies, which do not permanently keep records." [...] Not only were potential victims denied the opportunity to check the call data, which <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> only keep for 12 months, they also did not become aware of the desirability of changing their access codes or of considering what damage might have been done to them as a result of interception.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the bill}} the NSA {{would no longer}} collect those phone records. Instead, most of the records would have stayed {{in the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies,</b> which would not have been {{required}} to hold them any longer than they already do for normal business purposes, which in some cases is 18 months. The bill would require the NSA to request specific data from phone companies under specified limits i.e. the NSA would need to show it had reasonable, articulable suspicion that the number it is interested in is tied to a foreign terrorist organization or individual. The proposed legislation would still have allowed analysts to perform so-called contact chaining in which they trace a suspect's network of acquaintances, but they would have been required to use a new kind of court order to swiftly obtain only those records that were linked, up to two layers away, to a suspect — even when held by different phone companies. It would also require the federal surveillance court to appoint a panel of public advocates to advance legal positions in support of privacy and civil liberties, and would expand company reporting to the public on the scope of government requests for customers' data. This USA Freedom Act version thus gained the support of the Obama Administration, including the director of national intelligence and attorney general, as well as many tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo as well as a diverse range of groups, including the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a surge in large data sets {{available}} on human movements. These data sets are usually obtained from cell phone or GPS data, with varying degrees of accuracy. For example, cell phone data is usually recorded whenever a call or a text message has been made or received by the user, and contains the location of the tower that the phone has connected to as well as the time stamp. In urban areas, user and the telecommunication tower might be only a few hundred meters away from each other, while in rural areas this distance might well be in region of a few kilometers. Therefore, there is varying degree of accuracy when it comes to locating a person using cell phone data. These datasets are anonymized by <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> so as to hide and protect the identity of actual users. As example of its usage, researchers [...] used the trajectory of 100,000 cell phone users within a period of six months, while in much larger scale [...] trajectories of three million cell phone users were analyzed.GPS data are usually much more accurate even though they usually are, because of privacy concerns, much harder to acquire. Massive amounts of GPS data describing human mobility are produced, for example, by on-board GPS devices on private vehicles. The GPS device automatically turns on when the vehicle starts, and the sequence of GPS points the device produces every few seconds forms a detailed mobility trajectory of the vehicle. Some recent scientific studies compared the mobility patterns emerged from mobile phone data with those emerged from GPS data.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} 150 years, {{people with disabilities}} were barely {{acknowledged}} {{in the creation of}} telecommunication. One little known fact is that when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone he intended to create it for the use of deaf people. Many people are unaware of this fact because most financial and political decisions in our society are made by people who are not disabled. Eventually, installing phones in every building in most Western countries became a nationwide goal. However, these phones were virtually impossible for deaf people to use. Also, accessibility to telecommunication {{is an important factor in}} aiding the disabled, thereby considerations such as making payphones large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and telephones with large buttons to aid people with dexterity problems. Accessibility to telecommunications was not a major concern until the 1990s with the creation of the mobile phone and the 1996 Telecommunications Act which ensured that all telecommunication technology be available to disabled people. However, this Act did not ensure that disabled people could gain access to these technologies. This quote by Goggin and Newell explains the effect of the old telecommunication technology and the new technology such as mobile phones on the social construction of disability: “Not only are our scientific and technological enquiries (sic) manifestly both very productive and very destructive, but we will inevitably come to depend on them to resolve the very contradictions they have created.” The creation of the mobile phone in the 1990s both opened and closed doors for the disabled. With the creation of text messaging, the deaf were finally able to enter into the world of telecommunication. However, a disadvantage of the second generation mobile phones was that they caused hearing aid malfunctions due to a high level of electromagnetic interference. The phones would cause hearing aids to emit a buzzing noise which made if extremely difficult to hear and communicate. If <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>companies</b> would have considered disability in the creation of the new phones, this would not have been a problem. However since this was not the case, the companies were forced to consider redesigning the phones. Thus, the wireless access protocol (WAP) was manufactured, a 2.5 G (generational) mobile phone and then the 3G phone. However, the 3 G phone has also proven to cause some interference with hearing aids and also because the phone is a smaller in size it can be harder to operate for disabled people. In addition, voice-mail, automatic answering, call progression announcements and the internet are unhelpful to the visually impaired as they require sight to be able to operate.|$|E
