Though he did {{not wish}} for the crown, it was <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> him by Rajaraja Cholan and his friend Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan. He ruled for a period of about 12 years, after whose death Rajaraja Cholan ascended to the throne.|$|E

25|$|This repulse helped General Rosecrans {{buy time}} as he regrouped stragglers and brought up fresh units to reform the line. While he was doing this, three more charges were <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> the forward line, with the last charge finally {{breaking}} them, causing them to retreat back to the turnpike. Morton had his brigade form upon Stokes' battery again.|$|E

Loeb was instrumental in the victory of Meldrim Thomson, Jr., in the next gubernatorial election, and remained a political ally of Thomson's until Loeb's death.|$|E
25|$|The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) {{was founded}} in 1943 by Paul H.

60|$|M. de Vilmorin had {{realized}} nothing. The poor {{young man had}} acted upon impulse, upon the instinct of decency and honour, never counting the consequences. But he realized them now at the sinister invitation of M. de Chabrillane, and if he desired to avoid these consequences, {{it was out of}} respect for his priestly vocation, which strictly forbade such adjustments of disputes as M. de Chabrillane was clearly <b>thrusting</b> <b>upon</b> him.|$|R
60|$|The Baron {{went back}} to his {{flagship}} an infuriated, but by no means a wiser man. Wisdom--not even the pungent wisdom experience <b>thrusts</b> <b>upon</b> us--is not for such as M. de Rivarol. His anger embraced all things, but focussed chiefly upon Captain Blood. In some warped process of reasoning he held the buccaneer chiefly responsible for this misadventure. He went to bed considering furiously what he should say to Captain Blood upon the morrow.|$|R

25|$|Instant abort {{capability}} {{was important}} because certain failure modes such as loss of <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> liftoff (for example the third Redstone test flight in May 1954) {{could result in}} an immediate catastrophic situation. Other failure modes such as deviation from the proper flight path or a drop in engine chamber pressure during ascent did not necessarily present an immediate risk to the astronaut's safety and he could either initial a manual abort by pulling a lever in the capsule to activate the Launch Escape System or ground control could send a command to activate it.|$|E
25|$|Falsework {{centering}} (in British English: arch frame) is fabricated, typically from timbers and boards. Since each arch of a multi-arch bridge will {{impose a}} <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> its neighbors, {{it is necessary}} either that all arches of the bridge be raised at the same time, or that very wide piers be used. The thrust from the end arches is taken into the earth by substantial (vertical) footings at the canyon walls, or by large inclined planes forming in a sense ramps to the bridge, which may also be formed of arches.|$|E
25|$|The conquests {{destroyed}} little: {{what they}} did suppress were imperial rivalries and sectarian bloodletting among the newly subjected population. The Muslims tolerated Christianity, but they disestablished it; henceforward Christian life and liturgy, its endowments, politics and theology, would be a private and not a public affair. By an exquisite irony, Islam reduced the status of Christians to that which the Christians had earlier <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> the Jews, with one difference. The reduction in Christian status was merely judicial; it was unaccompanied by either systematic persecution or a blood lust, and generally, though not elsewhere and at all times, unmarred by vexatious behavior.|$|E

40|$|Last {{couple of}} decades have been the golden age for cosmology. High quality data {{confirmed}} the broad paradigm of standard cosmology but have <b>thrusted</b> <b>upon</b> us a preposterous composition for the universe which defies any simple explanation, thereby posing probably the greatest challenge theoretical physics has ever faced. Several aspects of these developments are critically reviewed, concentrating on conceptual issues and open questions. [Topics discussed include: Cosmological Paradigm, Growth of structures in the universe, Inflation and generation of initial perturbations, Temperature anisotropies of the CMBR, Dark energy, Cosmological Constant, Deeper issues in cosmology. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{course of}} Chad's life between his stay in Ireland and his {{emergence}} as a Church leader is unknown. In fact, {{it is possible that}} he had only recently returned from Ireland when prominence was <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> him. However, the growing importance of his family within the Northumbrian state is clear from Bede's account of Cedd's career of the founding of their monastery at Lastingham. This concentration of ecclesiastical power and influence within the network of a noble family was probably common in Anglo-Saxon England: an obvious parallel would be the children of Merewalh in Mercia in the following generation.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, though, the Wealden ironmasters enjoyed {{their day}} in the sun, perhaps no more than Parson Levett whose career was <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> him by circumstance. He became a very, very rich man. His brother John {{was one of the}} largest landowners in Sussex. At John Levett's death, the Levett brother had died possessed of more than 20 manors across Sussex. At his death nearly 20 years later, Reverend William Levett's will shows that he fared even better. The voluminous document, in which Levett named Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu as executor, {{demonstrates}} the riches that accrued to the entrepreneurs of the coming Iron Age.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Boyce {{successfully}} led {{a campaign}} to have the WFM adopt socialism as its official economic policy. An ardent socialist, Boyce famously declared:There can be no harmony between organized capitalists and organized labor. Our present wage system is slavery in its worst form. … Advise strikes as the weapon {{to be used by}} labor to obtain its rights, and you will be branded as criminals who aim to ruin the business interests of the country. Change from the policy of simple trades unionism that is fast waning, and you will be told that your action is premature, as this is not the time. Pursue the methods adopted by capitalists and you will be sent to prison for robbery or executed for murder. Demand, and your demands will be construed into threats of violence against the rights of private property calculated to scare capital. Avail yourself of your constitutional rights and propose to take political action, and you will be charged with selling out the organization to some political party. Counsel arbitration, and you will be told that there is nothing to arbitrate. Be conservative, and your tameness will be construed as an appreciation of the conditions <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> you by trusts and syndicates. Take what action you will in the interests of labor, the trained beagles in the employ of capital from behind their loathsome fortress of disguised patriotism will howl their tirade of condemnation.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the bulk}} of US civilians had been {{evacuated}} out of South Korea by ship, the priority of FEAF changed to a military nature. The 339th F(AW)S received orders from Fifth Air Force to move all available aircraft, along with crews and equipment, to Itazuke Air Base to assist the 68th in providing air cover for the evacuation of Seoul. However, the 339th's complement of aircraft were scattered over several bases at the time. Seven F-82s at Yokota AB were flyable and two were in the hangar undergoing maintenance for major repairs. Four other F-82s were at Misawa AB on TDY. The three at Yokota were dispatched immediately to Itazuke, {{as well as the}} four at Misawa, making a total of seven combat ready F-82Gs present for duty on 27 June. The 68th F(AW)S had a total of twelve operational F-82Gs. This, combined with what the 339th could contribute, was insufficient to meet the combat needs <b>thrust</b> <b>upon</b> FEAF. The F-80 Shooting Star was available, but its thirsty jet engine meant it could only remain over the airfield for a few minutes before having to return to base and it could not reach the forward combat area from Japan. No USAF P-51 Mustangs were available, and the British Commonwealth had not yet made a decision to commit to combat in Korea, making the presence of Australian Mustangs in Japan academic at this critical situation. FEAF ordered Twentieth Air Force to send eight F-82s from its 4th F(AW)S from Okinawa to Itazuke, making a total of 27 F-82s available for combat duty. This was commendable, considering that on 31 May 1950 a total of 32 F-82s existed within FEAF. With these combined squadrons, the 347th Provisional Fighter Group (AW) was formed.|$|E

50|$|Thrusts and duplexes {{are also}} found in accretionary wedges in the ocean trench margin of {{subduction}} zones, where oceanic sediments are scraped off the subducted plate and accumulate. Here, the accretionary wedge must thicken by up to 200% and this is achieved by stacking <b>thrust</b> fault <b>upon</b> <b>thrust</b> fault in a melange of disrupted rock, often with chaotic folding. Here, ramp flat geometries are not usually observed because the compressional force is at a steep angle to the sedimentary layering.|$|R

5000|$|The {{common-sense}} {{conception of}} change involves at bottom the same contradiction of opposing qualities in one real.

The metaphysical supplementing is also fundamentally as before. Since c depended {{on a series}} of reals A3+A3+A3 ... in connection with A, and d may be said similarly to depend on a series A4+A4+A4 ..., then the change from c to d means, not that the central real A or any real has changed, but that A is now in connection with A4, etc., and no longer in connection with A3, etc.|$|R
