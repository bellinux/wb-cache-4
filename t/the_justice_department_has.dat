25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> split {{over the}} {{constitutionality}} of legislation to give the District of Columbia voting representation in the House of Representatives. The Office of Legal Counsel reported to Attorney General Eric Holder that the proposed legislation would be unconstitutional, but Holder overrode that determination and instead obtained an opinion from officials of the United States Solicitor General's office that the legislation could be defended if it were challenged after its enactment.|$|E
25|$|Since the interview, the Judiciary Committee has {{continued}} its investigation. On April 17, 2008, the Judiciary Committee {{released a report}} which provided {{some of the details}} into the investigation into the US Attorney firings. The report stated it was impossible to know if Wecht's prosecution was politically motivated because <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> not turned over certain documents to committee investigators, and U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Schwab has refused to hold a hearing on Wecht's claim of selective prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Although Americans may favor one {{immigration}} policy over another, perceptions {{of government and}} officials' ability to implement these policies is consistently negative. In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a set of executive actions which could extend at least temporary legal status to {{nearly half of the}} illegal immigrants in the United States. The Republican majority in the new Congress as 2015 is challenging these actions. Although some Republican senators did vote for the reform bill of 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, Obama's executive steps are not in accord with the overall stated policy position of the Republican Party. On February 16, 2015, a federal district court judge issued a temporary injunction against the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability program (one of the November 20, 2014 deferred action measures). <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> appealed the injunction.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 2015, {{a federal}} judge sentenced Petraeus to two years {{probation}} plus a fine of $100,000. The fine was more than double <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> requested.|$|R
25|$|In June 2011, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{decided not}} to file charges against Coleman or Kazeminy. Louis Freeh, an {{attorney}} for Kazeminy and a former FBI Director in the Clinton Administration, said he learned <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> ended <b>the</b> investigation in a February 24 meeting with Andrew Levchuk of the department's Public Integrity Section in Washington.|$|R
25|$|On December 4, 2010 the New York Times {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> ended its investigation {{on the relationship}} between Mr. Lewis and Copeland Lowery. “The D.O.J. response confirms what I’ve known from Day 1 — that the facts and the truth of this matter will ultimately prevail,” Mr. Lewis said in a statement.|$|R
2500|$|After his investigation, Assistant Inspector General James Ebbitt {{testified that}} he found no {{evidence}} of CIA involvement in the program. Congressman Charles Rose, after hearing Eitel's testimony, went on record saying that he was suspicious, stating, [...] "This situation stinks to high heaven." [...] Both the CIA and the Forest Service have vehemently denied CIA involvement in the exchange program. Ultimately, all of the CIA allegations link back to Eitel's claims, and other than his persistent testimony in hearings and later in court, no evidence has been produced corroborating a CIA link to the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> also denied any link, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Claire Lefkowitz on record as stating [...] "We've never found any evidence of CIA involvement." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> {{used the}} False Claims Act to recover more than $7.7 billion from January 2009 to June 2012 in cases {{involving}} fraud against federal health care programs.|$|E
50|$|The {{parents of}} the victim {{presented}} a disciplinary complaint against the Dessau-Roßlau chief prosecutor Folker Bittmann; however <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> so far seen no reason to employ a different prosecutor other than Bittmann.|$|E
5000|$|Negotiations between Megaupload and <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>have</b> {{since been}} taking place. With Megaupload stating that its [...] "legal team {{is working hard}} to reunite our users with their data". Dotcom also stated that they [...] "found a large number of Mega {{accounts}} from US Government officials including <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> of <b>Justice</b> and <b>the</b> US Senate".|$|R
30|$|During Spring 2004 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{once again}} decided {{to round up}} Arabs and Muslims for “voluntary” interviews. On May 28 it was {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> targeted 5, 000 Muslims and Arabs for questioning, questioning based on religion and ethnicity, and not on individualized criminal suspicion (American Civil Liberties Union [2004]).|$|R
5000|$|On June 7, 2012, {{under the}} threat of being held in {{contempt}} of Congress for not turning over additional requested documents, Attorney General Holder appeared at his seventh Congressional hearing, where he continued to deny knowledge of [...] "gunwalking" [...] by high-level officials. By then, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> turned over more than 7,000 pages of documents.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice {{stated that}} no charges would be filed against Mollohan {{and that it}} had closed its {{investigation}}. Ben Friedman of the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington told CREW that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> [...] "closed the investigation into the case." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rep. Jim Jordan, who {{introduced}} the resolution, said that [...] "we need this {{special counsel to}} help us {{get to the truth}} because the so-called investigation by <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> been a joke. The current investigation has no credibility because it is being headed by a maxed-out donor who is financially invested in the president's success." ...|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 2008 Hatfill was exonerated by the {{government}} and a settlement was announced in which <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> agreed to pay $4.6 million (consisting of $2.825 million in cash and an annuity paying $150,000 a year for 20 years) to settle the lawsuit in which Hatfill claimed the Justice Department violated his privacy rights by speaking with reporters about the case.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, it was {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> secretly subpoenaed his phone records as part of leak investigation into who provided the Associated Press information about a bomb plot foiled by the CIA. It was later revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> conducted leak investigations into his stories twice before. He has been highly critical of government secrecy and the media's willingness to accept it.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> {{also named}} Las Vegas among the 17 most likely {{destinations}} for human trafficking.|$|R
50|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} in 1954 by the United States <b>Department</b> of <b>Justice</b> as <b>the</b> Young American Award for Service and the Young American Award for Bravery. Each of these awards {{were to be}} presented to two young people from each state and territory annually. <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> trouble promoting <b>the</b> award and approached the BSA for assistance in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|As noted, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> {{reported}} to Congress on {{its use of}} Section 213. Codifying this practice would allow Congress and the public to assess {{in years to come}} if the standard is too strict or too liberal. The fact that a defender of the PATRIOT Act would oppose routine reporting on how it is working shows the unreasonableness of the [...] "don't change a comma" [...] position.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> split {{over the}} {{constitutionality}} of legislation to give the District of Columbia voting representation in the House of Representatives. The Office of Legal Counsel reported to Attorney General Eric Holder that the proposed legislation would be unconstitutional, but Holder overrode that determination and instead obtained an opinion from officials of the United States Solicitor General's office that the legislation could be defended if it were challenged after its enactment.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the reforms}} are a push for further Mens rea requirements, meaning {{criminal}} intent must be proven to establish fault. The Justice Department {{noted that some}} white-collar crimes, including food safety violations and corporate pollution, would become more difficult to prosecute. However, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> been accused of over-criminalizing persons who have committed minor infractions without intent or even knowledge of the law. In essence, the reforms could potentially overturn Ignorantia juris non excusatstatutes.|$|E
5000|$|Former Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Col. Lawrence B. Wilkerson, {{has since}} {{revealed}} that [...] "as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May 2002—well before <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another {{terrorist attack on}} the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida." ...|$|R
50|$|The Judge Donald W. VanArtsdalen of United States District Court {{ruled that}} the three had contributed {{significantly}} to the Government's case against SmithKline. ordered the government to pay $42.3 million to three men who helped <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> expose Medicare fraud at SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories Inc. <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> resisted paying <b>the</b> men the 15 to 25 percent share of SmithKline's settlement specified for whistleblowers by the federal False Claims Act.|$|R
25|$|While the {{language}} of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> expressed First Amendment concerns. In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General Daniel Levin reversed this opinion, and the U.S. Agency for International Development issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.|$|R
5000|$|On December 13, 2012, the Assistant Inspector General {{notified}} the EPA {{they would be}} conducting an audit into record keeping practices {{associated with the use}} of private email accounts by Lisa Jackson under the name of [...] "Richard Windsor." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> agreed to release 12,000 emails at a rate of 3000 per week from this account beginning January 14, 2013 in response to a lawsuit brought by a Washington attorney.|$|E
50|$|Since the interview, the Judiciary Committee has {{continued}} its investigation.

50|$|For civil enforcement, the PRO-IP Act {{increases}} the maximum $30,000 penalty for compilations and increases penalties for repeat offenders. It raises {{the penalty for}} statutory damages for counterfeit goods from $1,000 to $200,000, which was originally a range from $500 to $100,000. For repeat offenders, the maximum statutory damages range from $1-2 million. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> the authority to conduct civil asset forfeiture, in which any computer or network hardware used {{in the act of}} a copyright crime may be seized and auctioned off.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> been {{tasked with}} the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce since 1887, though it lacked the staff to do so. It had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the Oregon land fraud scandal {{at the turn of}} the 20th Century. President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the Attorney General.|$|R
50|$|There were {{allegations}} that Siegelman's prosecution was politically motivated. Purportedly Bush-appointed officials at <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> pressed for <b>the</b> prosecution, as did Leura Canary, a U.S. Attorney in Montgomery, Alabama. Her husband was Alabama's top Republican operative {{and he had}} for years worked closely with Karl Rove, part of the George W. Bush White House staff. The federal court approved the release of Siegelman on bail.|$|R
50|$|While the {{language}} of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> expressed First Amendment concerns.

50|$|The {{action by}} Mr. Bush to revoke the pardon is {{considered}} unprecedented, {{and it is}} unclear {{that the president has}} the power to withdraw a pardon. However, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> stated that the pardon was never official, having never been delivered to the person who requested it, and that Toussie would have no legal ground on which to challenge the withdrawal. It appears that the pardon would have made it possible for Toussie to re-enter the real estate business in New York state, which {{he would not be able}} to do as a felon.|$|E
5000|$|In a January 29, 2013 {{letter to}} Holder, Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Charles Grassley (R-IA) had criticized this Justice Department policy citing [...] "important {{questions}} about the Justice Department's prosecutorial philosophy". After receipt of a DoJ response letter, Brown and Grassley issued a statement saying, [...] "The Justice Department's response is aggressively evasive. It does not answer our questions. We {{want to know how}} and why <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> determined that certain financial institutions are 'too big to jail' and that prosecuting those institutions would damage the financial system." ...|$|E
5000|$|Law {{professor}} Jonathan Adler said, however, that [...] "Yates did {{not claim}} {{she was convinced}} the order was unlawful, but only {{that it was not}} 'wise or just'" [...] and that he was [...] "not aware of any instance in which <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>has</b> refused to defend a presumptively lawful executive action on this basis". Adler argued that she should have resigned and publicly stated her reasons for doing so. It was reported that Yates considered and opted not to resign because {{she did not want to}} leave her successor facing the same question.|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2010 <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{announced}} {{it would not be}} pursuing charges against Jackson. Jackson’s lawyers noted that a lawyer at <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department’s</b> public integrity unit told them that it was closing its investigation. One lawyer for Jackson stated that <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> been unable to find evidence that Jackson received any benefit in exchange for his office’s recommendations and that “when that quid pro quo is missing, it takes away any motivation for improper steering.” ...|$|R
50|$|In 1983, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> arrested some well-respected {{members of}} the Italian show {{business}} industry who had been above suspiscion, thus attracting much needed public attention {{to the work of}} law-enforcement agencies in cracking down on Organized Crime. This move was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>department's</b> perception that a drive against Organized Crime could only be successful if public opinion was focused on it, and therefore strove very hard to find any incriminating evidence against people able to attract media attention.|$|R
50|$|Activists {{working as}} <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>have</b> sent out letter bombs and {{envelopes}} rigged with poisoned razor blades. In 1994, a rat trap equipped with razor blades {{was sent to}} Prince Charles after he took his sons on their first foxhunt. Tom King, a former Defence Secretary), was sent an incendiary device, which failed to explode, after he defended foxhunting during a debate in parliament. Michael Howard, at the time Home Secretary, also received one.|$|R
