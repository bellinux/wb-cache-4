5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, the {{relationship}} between the two countries was well established. In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia, in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have been}} financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with the physical environment for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became a growing problem due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as a <b>testing</b> <b>ground</b> for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E
