5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E
5|$|The first {{herbarium}} {{collection of}} B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated to make that revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the herbarium at Canberra under that name.|$|E

5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a rufous chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E

25|$|M. jablonskiae {{was first}} {{described}} and named by William G. Parker and Randall B. Irmis in 2006, {{on the basis}} of the holotype PEFO 31207, posterior skull roof and braincase missing the rostrum and palate. This specimen was initially referred to Pseudopalatus cf. mccauleyi by Parker and Irmis (2004) based on the morphology of the squamosals and the opisthotic, then to Pseudopalatus sp. by Parker and Irmis (2005) and finally to Pseudopalatus jablonskiae by Parker and Irmis (2006). It was collected in September 2002 from the lower Jim Camp Wash beds, Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation, at locality PFV 295, near Mountain Lion Mesa in Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. The specific name honors Pat Jablonsky, who discovered the holotype and only known specimen. Following the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of Machaeroprosopus by Parker et al. (in press), all species of Pseudopalatus, including P. jablonskiae, were reassigned to Machaeroprosopus. This was already accepted by Stocker and Butler (2013).|$|E
25|$|The {{varieties}} {{of the forests}} that exist in Sundarbans include mangrove scrub, littoral forest, saltwater mixed forest, brackish water mixed forest and swamp forest. Besides the forest, there are extensive areas of brackish water and freshwater marshes, intertidal mudflats, sandflats, sand dunes with typical dune vegetation, open grassland on sandy soils and raised areas supporting a variety of terrestrial shrubs and trees. Since Prain's report there have been considerable changes in the status of various mangrove species and <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of the man-grove flora. However, very little exploration of the botanical nature of the Sundarbans {{has been made to}} keep up with these changes. Differences in vegetation have been explained in terms of freshwater and low salinity influences in the Northeast and variations in drainage and siltation. The Sundarbans has been classified as a moist tropical forest demonstrating a whole mosaic of seres, comprising primary colonisation on new accretions to more mature beach forests. Historically vegetation types have been recognised in broad correlation with varying degrees of water salinity, freshwater flushing and physiography.|$|E

25|$|M. buceros {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1881 as Belodon buceros, {{on the basis}} of the holotype AMNH 2318, partial skull. It was collected from the Norian-aged Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, at the Arroyo Seco drainage, Orphan Mesa in the Rio Arriba County of New Mexico. Later, the skull was occasionally referred to Phytosaurus buceros Jaekel (1910) erected a new genus for the species, creating Metarhinus buceros, however this generic name was preoccupied by Metarhinus Osborn, 1908, a brontotheriid mammal. Mehl (1915) referred this species to Lophoprosopus, as Lophoprosopus buceros, but as the type species of this genus is considered to be synonymous with Nicrosaurus kapffi, Mehl (1916) erected a new genus for B. buceros, creating Machaeroprosopus buceros, and then named a new species of the genus, M. validus. Subsequent studies considered M. validus to be the type species of Machaeroprosopus. Later, the skull was referred to as Rutiodon buceros, Machaeroprosopus buceros or Pseudopalatus buceros. Long and Murry (1995) erected a new genus for the species, not knowing that M. validus was not in fact the type species of Machaeroprosopus, creating Arribasuchus buceros. Subsequent studies, including Hungerbühler (2002), Lucas et al. (2002), Zeigler et al. (2002), Irmis (2005) and Parker and Irmis (2006), referred the species back to Pseudopalatus buceros, and considered Arribasuchus to be a junior synonym of Pseudopalatus. A <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of Machaeroprosopus, conducted by Parker et al. (in press), revealed that Pseudopalatus buceros has priority as the type species of the genus. Therefore, the name Pseudopalatus was considered a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus, and all species of the former were reassigned to the later, including P. buceros. Following the revision, M. andersoni was treated as a valid species by Stocker and Butler (2013), and not a junior synonym of Machaeroprosopus buceros as was previously suggested by Long and Murry (1995). Other specimens were referred to P. buceros by Long and Murry (1995), although all specimens from Arizona and Texas was later reassigned to other species (namely M. lottorum, M. mccauleyi and M. validus), and as M. andersoni from the Dockum Group was re-validated, M. buceros is currently known only from Chinle Formation of New Mexico.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> {{of western}} North American populations {{of this species}} was published, {{formally}} establishing them as a distinct species, Boletus rex-veris.

500|$|A {{phenetic}} {{analysis of}} the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which [...] A.cuneatus was grouped with A.stictus.

[...] Nelson's analysis supported Bentham's sections, {{and so they were}} retained when Nelson published a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> of the genus in 1978. He further subdivided A.sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A.cuneata placed into A.subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth, but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos, for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became cuneatus.|$|E
500|$|First {{described}} in 1777 by English illustrator John Frederick Miller, M.murinus remained the only species of its genus, {{as well as}} the name used for all mouse lemurs on Madagascar, between the first major <b>taxonomic</b> <b>revision</b> in 1931 and an extensive field study conducted in 1972. [...] The field study distinguished the brown mouse lemur, M.rufus—then considered a subspecies—as a distinct, sympatric species in the southeastern part of the island. [...] Upon this revision, the gray mouse lemur was thought to account for all mouse lemurs that lived in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur represented the eastern rainforest mouse lemurs. [...] More recently, scientific understanding of the distribution and diversity of the mouse lemurs has become much more complex. [...] Additional field studies, genetic testing, and resulting taxonomic revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new mouse lemur species, demonstrating that the genus includes at least 17 cryptic species.|$|E
