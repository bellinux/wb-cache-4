5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
500|$|Kilner was a {{favourite}} of cricket writer Neville Cardus, who attributed several sayings {{to him in}} his prose. For example, Cardus described Kilner {{as saying}} about Yorkshire and Lancashire matches at the time: [...] "What we want is no umpires and fair cheating all round," [...] and [...] "We say good morning and after <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> say is 'Howzat?'" [...] Also, when asked about contemporary problems in the game, in particular the negative attitude of some teams, he replied the game was fine, it was [...] "t'crowd that wants educating up to it." ...|$|E

And, fifty years down the line, isn't <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E

[...] He later said [...] "in {{fairness}} to his staff," [...] he had told them he might do such hiking. Sanford said he cut his trip short after his chief of staff, Scott English, told him his trip was gaining {{a lot of media}} attention and he needed to come back. These events prompted Republican state senator Jake Knotts to comment, [...] "Lies. Lies. Lies. <b>Thats</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> get from his staff. <b>Thats</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> get from his people. <b>Thats</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> get from him." ...|$|R

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> had to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading the First Meditation as {{an effort}} to coax Aristotelians away from their {{customary}} opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous [...] "Dream Argument" [...] to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later [...] "Evil Demon Argument". The latter suggests <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The Painter's Analogy, which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.|$|E
