5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
25|$|The Unfederated Malay States, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintained}} their quasi-independence, had more autonomy, and instead of having a Resident they were required only to accept a British Advisor, though in reality they were still bound by treaty to accept the advice. The British undertook far less economic exploitation as they primarily wished <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> these states in line. Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were surrendered by Siam after the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. Independent Johor, meanwhile, had to surrender Singapore to the British earlier on. Despite the Sultan's political effort, {{he was forced to}} accept an advisor in 1914, becoming the last Malay state to lose its sovereignty (British involvement in Johor actually began as early as 1885).|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> doing {{things the way they}} have been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", as well as the decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E

"Now if {{you really}} want <b>to</b> help, <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> this child quiet while I see to the sickest ones," [...] said Belle, dumping a stout infant on to his knee, {{thrusting}} an orange into his hand, and leaving him aghast while she unpacked her little messes, and comforted the maternal bird.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari were {{in trouble}} during qualifying. Both Michele Alboreto and René Arnoux were forced to run a lot of wing on their cars {{due to a lack}} of grip and {{aerodynamics}} that saw the 126C4's want to lift at high speed. The amount of wing they were forced <b>to</b> run <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the scarlet cars on the road limited them <b>to</b> <b>just</b> 300 km/h on the straights.|$|R
50|$|The Friends of the Earth criticised British {{government}} of the intended cuts to flood defence spending. The protection against increasing flood risk {{as a result of}} climate change requires rising investment. In 2009, the Environment Agency calculated that UK need to be spending £20m more compared to 2010-11 as the baseline, each and every year out <b>to</b> 2035, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pace with climate change.|$|R
500|$|Bates {{called the}} {{recording}} process [...] "seamless" [...] {{because of the}} unconventional studio environment. Manson, isolated in a vocal booth {{with no more than}} three people in the control room at any one time, was free to improvise or develop new lyrics and vocal melodies at a high speed. By using Pro Tools, Bates was able to [...] "manipulate the music {{in a way that would}} allow [...] <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> working on it without causing [...] If he had an idea, he could just throw it down without there being a lot to explain." [...] The majority of the album was recorded during a three-month period. The band's manager, Tony Ciulla, only became aware that Manson had been recording new material when he was invited to Bates' home recording studio, where Bates played final cuts of nine of the album's ten tracks; [...] "Cupid Carries a Gun" [...] was the only track not yet completed. With the base tracks recorded, overdubbing took place over the following six months between Manson's acting commitments on Sons of Anarchy and Bates scoring the 2014 television series Salem.|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Official Xbox Magazines Francesca Reyes {{also scored}} it 8.5 out of 10, praising the gameplay, {{difficulty}} level, and the game's pace; [...] "it {{makes for a}} frantic, dizzying, four- to five-hour rush. And that's Deadlights strongest suit: you feel a constant, adrenaline-fueled urge <b>to</b> <b>just.</b> <b>Keep.</b> Moving." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We can {{do without}} them," [...] Kit said to Shorty. [...] "You take the bow with a paddle, and I'll handle the steering-sweep.

2500|$|According to The Hill, a Democratic aide to a {{high-ranking}} senator commented that Lieberman might be {{stripped of his}} Democratic privileges in the Senate. [...] "At this point Lieberman cannot expect <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> his seniority," [...] said the aide. [...] "He can’t run against a Democrat and expect to waltz back to the caucus with the same seniority as before. It would give {{the view that the}} Senate is a country club rather than representative of a political party and political movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{financial}} problems began with PokerSpot, players who called PokerSpot customer support requesting withdrawal of their deposited funds were told many different stories, {{ranging from a}} 30-business-day hold to a promise that their checks were [...] "already in the mail." [...] In an online newsgroup in November 2002, Boyd admitted that players had been deceived. Boyd stated that he told his Customer Support staff to, [...] "... spin {{it so that the}} players don't feel the need to make a mad rush on the cardroom OR the need to tell everyone they know that PokerSpot [...] going to hell in a handbasket. Spin it so that the players continue <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> on playing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like." [...] Bassist Ben Kenney stated, [...] "Being with music is a creative thing and requires a certain amount of creativity - <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> going back to that well over and over again, it doesn’t have a chance to replenish." ...|$|E

"We are {{not going}} to meet Reddy Fox," [...] replied Peter, [...] "but if we should, {{all you have to do}} is <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> your eyes on the white patch on the seat of my {{trousers}} and follow me. I have fooled Reddy so many times that I'm not afraid of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt was alarmed. [...] "But still, {{of course}} it won't do <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> {{knocking}} the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they're operating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The way these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime, {{and of course the}} burden falls on you and me that have to pay a seven-cent fare!
