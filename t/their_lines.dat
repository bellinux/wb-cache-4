5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind <b>their</b> <b>lines.</b> Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record <b>their</b> <b>lines.</b> In interviews, Halos voice actors stated {{that they had no}} idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, the voice of the game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished <b>their</b> <b>lines,</b> their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their own style and personality.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Army Wing {{aircraft}} {{were assigned}} to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well behind <b>their</b> <b>lines,</b> to carry out daily photography, and to conduct air raids.

5|$|Further inland, another serious {{attack was}} made on the British lines of {{communication}} from Ramleh by units of both the Ottoman 16th Division on the plain and the 19th Division in the hills. The aim of this counterattack was the destruction of two British Empire divisions in the hills by cutting <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> of communication.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> properly.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying <b>their</b> <b>lines.</b> Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Attached to the 5th Light Infantry at Alexandra Barracks were a {{detachment}} of 97 Indian officers and {{men of the}} Malay States Guides Mule Battery. Raised in 1896 for the internal garrisoning of the Federated Malay States, the regiment was recruited from Sikhs, Pathans and Punjabis in both India and Malaya. The British officer commanding the battery was shot dead by an unknown sniper as he hastened to the gun park. The MSG gunners then dispersed when {{a large body of}} 5th LI mutineers approached <b>their</b> <b>lines.</b> The MSG artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought into action by the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day of}} 25 October, Puller's men {{attacked}} and eradicated the salient in <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> and hunted small groups of Japanese infiltrators, killing 104 Japanese soldiers.

5|$|During the {{previous}} night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker {{had ordered the}} 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5.

At 00:15, September 6, the marines began leaving <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Shōji {{to abandon}} his {{positions}} at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area.

Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape. The Americans closed the gap in <b>their</b> <b>lines</b> on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south.|$|E
