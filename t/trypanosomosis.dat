In August 2014, Bill Gates visited GALVmed’s Edinburgh office to see and hear first-hand the progress being made by GALVmed. Apart from the completed phase 1 and ongoing phase 2 PLSHL projects, GALVmed conceived and was a partner in the Vaccines for the Control of Neglected Animal Diseases in Africa (VACNADA) project, which ran from 2010 to 2011. The €20million VACNADA project, funded by the European Union Food Facility and with overall coordination of the implementing partners by the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), was an intervention aimed to enhance food security through reducing the impact of animal disease by increasing access to and use of quality vaccines. Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coopération internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le développement (CIRAD). GALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines. In 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth £8,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost effective control of animal African <b>trypanosomosis</b> (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis {{for the development of a}} vaccine for AAT. The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,. The DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$ 1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
40|$|In {{the humid}} and subhumid tropics, <b>trypanosomosis</b> is an {{economically}} important zoonotic protozoan {{disease of the}} commonly kept farm animal species and their wild relatives. For example, more than 20 % of the humid western and southwestern Ethiopia, which is {{home to more than}} 14 million heads of cattle, is under varying levels of <b>trypanosomosis</b> risk. Our study was, therefore, initiated to document farmers’ perception on <b>trypanosomosis</b> and Sheko’s trypanotolerance character. Our findings showed that <b>trypanosomosis</b> was the most frequently reported cattle disease in the Bench Maji Zone. Accordingly, 76. 7 % of the farmers reported the epidemiological importance of <b>trypanosomosis,</b> and they also noted that <b>trypanosomosis</b> on average accounted for 63. 0 % of annualized cattle death. The reported signs of <b>trypanosomosis</b> and trypanotolerance indicators were consistent with literature reports. Moreover, 66. 7 % of the farmers reported Sheko’s trypanotolerance character. In the course of time, smallholder farmers have developed ethnoveterinary practices that are mainly used to prevent the landing of vector flies on the animal. Wet and warm seasons of the year, i. e., spring and, to some extent, the beginning of summer and autumn, were reported as peak periods of <b>trypanosomosis</b> risk. Therefore, this showed the need for incorporating farmers’ knowledge in <b>trypanosomosis</b> control programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine factors associated with occurrence of <b>trypanosomosis</b> in the first generation (F 1) crossbreds between trypanotolerant Orma Boran and trypanosusceptible Teso zebu cattle in a <b>trypanosomosis</b> endemic area in Teso District, western Kenya. The offspring were screened for <b>trypanosomosis</b> and other haemoparasites using parasitological methods. Packed cell volume (PCV), body weights and tsetse density (FTD) were also determined. Factors considered in the analysis included sex, age, body weight and season of the year. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used for multivariable analysis to account for clustering of observations at the animal level and estimate outcome variance parameters. The overall <b>trypanosomosis</b> prevalence was 2. 3 % (n= 477) probably corresponding to low FTD in the area (< 1 fly/trap/day). The risk of <b>trypanosomosis</b> infection was higher in dry than wet season (OR = 5. 4) and in older than younger offspring (OR = 1. 1). The variance parameters obtained indicated that variation of <b>trypanosomosis</b> prevalence lay only at the animal level. Intercurrent haemoparasites detected included Anaplasma marginale, Theileria and Babesia species. Overall, the results suggested that when the tsetse density is very low, control of <b>trypanosomosis</b> in the Orma-Teso zebu offspring in western Kenya require targeting of individual affected animals in the dry seasons...|$|E
40|$|Tsetse-transmitted {{livestock}} <b>trypanosomosis</b> affects livestock {{in large}} parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In southern Africa two epidemiological situations can be distinguished. The disease can have an endemic nature with high morbidity and low mortality in the livestock population.

Epidemic <b>trypanosomosis,</b> with high morbidity and high mortality is found in areas where wildlife persist as main reservoir and where livestock {{come into contact with}} tsetse flies transmitting trypanosomes from the sylvatic reservoir. Based on the differences in impact of the disease on livestock health in these two epidemiological settings, the appropriateness of the available <b>trypanosomosis</b> control tools differs. In <b>trypanosomosis</b> endemic areas, trypanocidal drug use could be the most suitable approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aims of {{this study}} were to develop a {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) forecast and risk assessment model for cyclically transmitted <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Ethiopia by matching features in the environment to available information on the preferences and limits of tolerance of the parasite and its vector, and validate and further develop the GIS model using data from current and historical prevalence survey data and habitat microenvironment studies from <b>trypanosomosis</b> endemic areas. Results indicate that GIS model developed for parasitic diseases based on growing degree day (GDD) concept can be applied to tsetse-transmitted <b>trypanosomosis.</b> GIS for animal <b>trypanosomosis</b> was created using Food and Agriculture Organization – Crop Production System Zones (FAO-CPSZ) database and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and maximum temperature (Tmax) from the Global Land 1 km dataset. The two datasets used to determine the risk of tsetse flies and consequently animal <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Ethiopia indicated the magnitude of the disease and possible expansion of the “fly belt ” in the future. The GIS model indicated the distribution and importance of tsetse-transmitted <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Ethiopia. Spatial and statistical analysis verified the use of GDD concept and climate forecast system that was developed to determine the suitability of a given environment for the proliferation of a biotype, in this case tsetse and trypanosomes.

40|$|Background <b>Trypanosomosis</b> {{is a major}} {{impediment}} to livestock farming in sub-Saharan Africa and limits the full potential of agricultural development in the 36 countries where it is endemic.

In this study, we sought to investigate the prevalence of trypanosomes in small ruminants and pigs, and the potential of these livestock as reservoirs of potentially human-infective trypanosomes. The study was undertaken in 5 villages, to address two key questions: i) are small ruminants and pigs important in the transmission dynamics of <b>trypanosomosis?</b> and ii), do they harbour potentially human infective trypanosomes?

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{past and}} present approaches to managing tsetse-transmitted animal <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Africa and describes the three main weaknesses of these approaches, i. e., inappropriate objectives, inadequate links between research and policy-making {{and a lack of}} recognition that <b>trypanosomosis</b> should be high up on the social science research agenda. Making progress in managing <b>trypanosomosis</b> has been difficult and the authors argue that the weaknesses of the approaches must be corrected if Africa is to benefit from the few advances made so far, and for the continent to make further sustained efforts to combat the disease. The authors explain that this can be achieved by replacing the current widespread preoccupation among researchers and policymakers with controlling (or eradicating) <b>trypanosomosis</b> with a focus on managing (or coping with) the disease. In addition, ways of achieving greater coherence between research and policy-making must be explored. Finally, the social science issues raised by the question of which practical steps need to be taken to manage <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Africa should be placed at the forefront of research efforts...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{economic}} burden of <b>trypanosomosis</b> in three villages of the Metekel zone in 2009.

The overall mortality rate of cattle due to <b>trypanosomosis</b> was 4. 4 %. The mortality was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in an area where <b>trypanosomosis</b> prevalence was also higher. Many of the farmers prioritized losses of draft power as the most important impact of the disease. The overall prevalence of the disease was 12. 1 %.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a knowledge, attitude, {{practice}} (KAP) survey on how farmers (n = 895) manage cattle <b>trypanosomosis</b> in Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea.

Farmers reported that <b>trypanosomosis</b> {{was the most important}} cattle disease and estimated that 25 % of their herd fall sick each year and 18 % of the sick animals die. Nearly all sick animals (90 %) were treated with trypanocides and most treatments were administered by untrained farmers. Giving drugs was the strategy most used as primary means of protection (50 % of farmers) followed by avoiding high risk areas (32 % of farmers) and keeping trypanotolerant cattle (7 % of farmers). Few farmers knew about communal tsetse control methods and those who did, rarely practiced them. Farmer diagnosis of <b>trypanosomosis</b> in cattle presented at clinics (n = 113) was in most cases (84 %) supported by laboratory tests. However, the signs that most farmers considered indicative of <b>trypanosomosis</b> (staring coat and emaciation) were poor predictors of <b>trypanosomosis.</b> We tested farmer knowledge of injection sites and trypanocide dilutions (n = 423 cattle), and while few (15 %) farmers gave under-dosages or over-dosage (2 % of farmers), injection techniques were poor with injection-related side effects in 24 % of cattle treated by farmers. Despite this, therapeutic outcomes were both objectively (clinical parameters) and subjectively (carer assessment) satisfactory in 89 % of cattle treated by farmers.

40|$|African animal <b>trypanosomosis</b> {{constrains}} {{agricultural production}} {{in areas of}} Africa that hold the continent's greatest potential for expanded agricultural production. Previous studies indicate {{that the incidence of}} trypanosomosis: (i) reduces calving rates by 1 - 12 percent in tolerant breeds and by 11 - 20 percent in susceptible breeds of cattle; (ii) increases calf mortality by 0 - 10 percent in tolerant breeds and by 10 - 20 percent in susceptible breeds of cattle; (iii) reduces milk offtake from trypanotolerant cattle by 10 - 26 percent; and (iv) reduces lambing and kidding rates by 4 - 38 percent. At the herd level, it is estimated that the incidence of <b>trypanosomosis</b> reduces cattle offtake by 5 - 30 percent, milk offtake by 10 - 40 percent, and the work performance of oxen by 33 percent. The risk of <b>trypanosomosis</b> also shapes farmers choices about livestock purchases, sales and overall herd size. The evidence from a small number of field studies suggests that farmers in areas of high <b>trypanosomosis</b> also shapes farmers choices about livestock purchases, sales and overall herd size. The evidence from a small number of field studies suggests that farmers in areas of high <b>trypanosomosis</b> risk keep 25 - 60 percent as many cattle as farmers in nearby areas of low risk. Impacts on other livestock species vary greatly depending upon the management system and level of susceptibility. Overall {{it has been estimated that}} <b>trypanosomosis</b> reduces the density of cattle by 37 percent in the sub-humid zone and 70 percent in the humid zone. The indirect effects of <b>trypanosomosis</b> risk on land use and agricultural production can be inferred from focused field studies and aggregate-level studies that have examined the relationship between livestock and crop production more generally.

The principal host species affected varies geographically, but buffalo, cattle, camels, and horses are particularly sensitive. Natural infections with Trypanosoma congolense, T. vivax, T. brucei, and T. evansi have been described in goats. <b>Trypanosomosis</b> in goats produces acute, subacute, chronic, or subclinical forms, being T. vivax, T. congolense, and T. evansi, the most invasive trypanosomes for goats. However, the role of goats in the epidemiology of <b>trypanosomosis</b> is largely discussed and not well understood.

When body score condition was considered, infection rate was 100, 6. 8 and 3. 5 % in camels recorded to have poor, fair and good body score, respectively. It was concluded that camel <b>trypanosomosis</b> is prevalent in camel herds and administrative localities, source, and body condition score were identified as important risk factors for the distribution of camel <b>trypanosomosis</b> in the area under study. To our knowledge, this is the first report for the detection of trypanosome pathogen in camels in Tanzania...|$|E
40|$|The {{current control}} {{strategies}} for tsetse-transmitted <b>trypanosomosis</b> in cattle (trypanocidal drugs tsetse control and trypanotolerant cattle) are briefly reviewed and their adoption rates in different geographic regions of sub-Saharan Africa are presented. The {{impact of these}} control strategies and the potential use of vaccines should they be developed, on <b>trypanosomosis</b> transmission were compared using a mathematical model. The relative <b>trypanosomosis</b> prevalence compared with no control was estimated {{across a range of}} control coverages (from none to complete control coverage) by varying the change in specific model parameters influenced by individual control measures. Based on this comparison, the relative rankings of the effect of control strategies on reducing disease prevalence were: vector control, vaccination, and drug use, in that order. In this model, trypanotolerance was assumed to decrease disease prevalence, but not to influence transmission. Differences in the predicted impact of control measures on the transmission of human sleeping sickness are discussed. Finally, the role of transmission model outputs as inputs for economic models to guide investment decisions for <b>trypanosomosis</b> control is emphasised...|$|E
