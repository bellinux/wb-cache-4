5|$|According {{to three}} 13th-century authors (Matthew Paris, Salimbene di Adam and Bernard of Besse), John became a Franciscan friar before his death. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> that John's declining health {{contributed to his}} conversion, but Bernard also {{described}} a recurring vision {{of an old man}} urging the emperor to join the Franciscans. Most 13th-century sources suggest that John died between 19 and 23 March 1237, the only Latin emperor to die in Constantinople.|$|E

They hinted that these modern young girls, well, honestly, their short skirts were short. They were proud to find {{that they were not}} shocked by such frank speaking. Tanis ventured, [...] "I know you'll understand--I mean--I don't quite know how to say it, but I do think that girls who pretend they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. They give away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman." ...|$|R

5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> they must stop the war but, once they reach the {{polluted}} air, they argue again in their urgency to get to war.|$|E
5|$|On {{a normal}} afternoon, Marge wants Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{to go for}} a walk. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> when faced with the threat of having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

60|$|Kenby {{ordered a}} bottle {{of one of the}} famous Wurzburg wines for their mutual {{consolation}} in her absence, and in the friendliness which its promoted <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> to spend the afternoon together. No man is so inveterate a husband as not to take kindly an occasional release to bachelor companionship, and before the dinner was over <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> that <b>they</b> would go to the Volksfest, and get some notion of the popular life and amusements of Wurzburg, {{which was one of the}} few places where Kenby had never been before; and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> that <b>they</b> would walk.|$|R
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Berengarius system, one of the {{proposed}} locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit the Orion ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras. Archer negotiates with Harrad-Sar and <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> to a joint magnesite mining operation, and the three slaves are given to him. They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise soon {{arrives at}} Tarquin's planet. He welcomes Archer and Hoshi and soon agrees {{to work on}} reading the weapon fragment, but only if Sato agrees to remain with him. <b>They</b> <b>agree,</b> and Enterprise departs to {{investigate}} the second sphere. Tarquin and Sato discuss many subjects and initially the alien seems trustworthy. However she also discovers {{that he had been}} watching her telepathically for some time and that she is not the first person to be brought here to provide companionship for him.|$|E

5|$|Hanada holes up in Misako's {{apartment}} and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening {{phone calls and}} forbidding {{him to leave the}} apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> to a temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} invest in pumpkins, but loses his entire investment. Late on a {{mortgage}} payment and short on money, he tries to borrow some, but to no avail. Homer keeps his money troubles secret from Marge. Meanwhile, Patty and Selma have received a promotion at the DMV. As a last resort, Homer asks the two if they will lend him the money, and <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> {{on the condition that}} he become their loyal servant. Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan. They proposed {{that a group of}} states, through legislation, form a compact wherein <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Peter uses {{information}} left by {{his father}} to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains {{that he had to}} leave, because he refused to cooperate with Norman's biogenetic weaponization plans. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the British scholarship, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and, vowing to go wherever she goes, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and overload Electro's body, killing him.|$|E

As they both feel the need for a physical connection, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also disagrees with the traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E

He informs his family that the new job pays better and provides free health-care for the family, but involves moving to Cypress Creek. The Simpson family initially opposes the move, but after they watch a promotional video about the planned community, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> that it is much better than Springfield. Abandoning their house, the Simpsons pack up and leave town.|$|E
