5000|$|<b>The</b> Pacific <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> {{largest of}} <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> also reaches northward from <b>the</b> Southern <b>Ocean</b> to <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Ocean.</b> It spans <b>the</b> gap between Australia and Asia, and the Americas. <b>The</b> Pacific <b>Ocean</b> meets <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> south of South America at Cape Horn.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> second largest, {{extends from}} <b>the</b> Southern <b>Ocean</b> between <b>the</b> Americas, and Africa and Europe, to <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Ocean.</b> <b>The</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> meets <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean</b> south of Africa at Cape Agulhas.|$|R
5|$|The major oceanic {{divisions}} are defined {{in part by}} the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these {{divisions are}} (in descending order of size) <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> Indian <b>Ocean,</b> <b>the</b> Southern <b>Ocean,</b> and <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Ocean.</b> Smaller regions of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with <b>the</b> World <b>Ocean.</b> Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.|$|R

5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>the</b> deep <b>ocean</b> {{contains}} {{much more}} {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} than <b>the</b> surface <b>ocean,</b> <b>the</b> concentration is only 15% higher in <b>the</b> deep <b>ocean</b> as compared to <b>the</b> surface <b>ocean</b> due to <b>the</b> higher volume of <b>the</b> deep <b>ocean.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>oceans</b> have a {{major impact}} on global {{geophysical}} processes of the Earth. Non-tidal changes in oceanic currents and ocean-bottom pressure have been shown to be a major source of polar motion excitation and also measurably change the length of the day. The changing mass distribution of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> causes <b>the</b> Earth's gravitational field to change and causes the center-of-mass of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> to change which in turn causes the center-of-mass of the solid Earth to change. The changing mass distribution of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> also changes <b>the</b> load on the oceanic crust, thereby affecting both the vertical and horizontal position of observing stations located near <b>the</b> <b>oceans.</b> Recognizing <b>the</b> important role that non-tidal oceanic processes play in Earth rotation dynamics and terrestrial reference frame definition, the International Earth Rotation Service has recently created a Special Bureau for <b>the</b> <b>Oceans</b> in order to facilitate research into these and other solid Earth geophysical processes affected by <b>the</b> <b>oceans...</b>|$|R

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E

40|$|The Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) {{has been}} {{collecting}} data over <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> since November 2006.
