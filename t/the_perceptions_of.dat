5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

40|$|Researchers in {{consumer}} {{and social psychology}} have developed various theories to account for shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> targets caused by contextual stimuli. In this previous work, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> a target stimulus is observed as it reacts to the presentation of contextual stimuli. Attention in the past research has focused entirely on the target. As a result, no one has investigated possible shifts in <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> contextual stimuli. <b>The</b> present research proposes and tests a reciprocity hypothesis to explain {{what happens to the}} contextual stimulus and suggests that not only is <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target shifted by the contextual stimulus, but also <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus is shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. That is, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted away from the target in a contrast condition, but toward the target in an assimilation condition. ^ Two studies with 390 undergraduates examined the hypothesis that, after priming, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target. In Study 1, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce a contrast effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted away from the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted away from the target as well. In Study 2, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce an assimilation effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target was shifted toward the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted toward the target. That was, results in both studies supported the predictions. Thus, after the priming procedure, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target (symmetrical <b>perception</b> shift). ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to focus}} on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX). It is assumed that the perceived quality of the relationship is not only related to the actual quality of the relationship, but also to followers' expectancies and preferences. However, {{little is known about}} person characteristics that are related to LMX perceptions. This study seeks to examine how far followers' leadership-related characteristics (romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence) are related to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 588 Dutch employees from different professions filled in questionnaires on romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence and their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Findings – Results indicate a positive relationship between need for leadership/dependence and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX, thought not for romance of leadership/idealised supervisor and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. An interaction was found between idealised supervisor and dependence on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Research limitations/implications – The study only focuses on four antecedents, although many others could have an effect on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. <b>The</b> study comprised a one-dimensional assessment of LMX. For future research, a multi-dimensional assessment is recommended. Practical implications – The results of this study imply that organisations need to address the expectations that followers have towards their leaders in order to avoid disappointments. Originality/value – This paper focuses on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX and how follower characteristics are related to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. It extends prior research on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leadership into LMX research. Similar to effect on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leadership behaviour, effects on <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX are important to take into account when LMX is assessed through follower ratings in order to avoid making incorrect conclusions. ...|$|R
40|$|Affirmative action {{policies}} {{are believed to}} have both positive and negative impacts on business. This paper takes a novel perspective to understand the negative impact of this policy on the organizational commitment and therefore the intention to leave (IL) on the part of native employees when they perceive unfair discrimination against expatriate employees. Based on analysis conducted by Structure Equation Modelling of answers from a sample of 440 employees in Saudi Arabia, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> affirmative action in an organization is found to affect <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> discrimination (national, gender and religious) in it. <b>The</b> <b>perception</b> among nationals <b>of</b> discrimination is found to fully mediate the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> an organization’s affirmative action policy and organizational commitment (OC).

40|$|Background & objectives: <b>The</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic {{knowledge}} {{is useful for}} improving the heath behaviour change against developing cancers.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine demographic and lifestyle factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge on the development of lung cancer. Methods: Data on 2, 295 US adults (739 had <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge) were taken from the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate potential factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge of lung cancer. Results: Participants aged ≥ 65 yr were more likely to have <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge than those aged 18 - 44 yr (OR= 1. 77, 95 % CI= 1. 27 - 2. 46). Higher education was associated with a greater <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge (OR= 1. 47, 95 % CI= 1. 16 - 1. 87). Subjects with correct smoking attitude were more than three times more likely to have <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge (OR= 3. 15, 95 % CI= 2. 10 - 4. 72).

Interpretation & conclusions: Positive associations were observed between education and lifestyle factors and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge on the development of lung cancer among US adults. Strategies developed to improve <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> genetic knowledge of lung cancer may target on individuals who are young, less educated, and lack correct smoking attitude or exercise...|$|R
25|$|However, {{many times}} there are methodological {{problems}} in these tests. Unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they {{ask about the}} likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine {{if there is an}} outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have.

Although the 'grade' standards required for admission are the same for both programmes, there is no moderation to ensure the difficulty of achieving a grade standard is the same between both programmes.
