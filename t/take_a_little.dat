25|$|Sometimes {{the doctor}} {{performs}} surgery through a tiny incision into which a small scope (arthroscope) is inserted {{to observe the}} inside of the joint. After this procedure, called arthroscopic surgery, the shoulder is generally restrained by a sling for 3 to 6 weeks, while full recovery, including physical therapy, takes several months. Arthroscopic techniques involving the shoulder are relatively new and many surgeons prefer to repair a recurrent dislocating shoulder by the time-tested open surgery under direct vision. There are usually fewer repeat dislocations and improved movement following open surgery, but it may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer to regain motion.|$|E

25|$|After the {{departure}} of long time Cowboy favorites DE/LB DeMarcus Ware and DT Jason Hatcher to free agency, coupled with a season ending knee injury to MLB Sean Lee during Organized Team Activity in late May, the Dallas Cowboys, {{were one of the}} most heavily admonished, and second guessed NFL franchises through the entire preseason, and half-way into the 2014 regular season. Much of the criticism was in response to the Cowboys selecting Notre Dame offensive guard Zack Martin over the perceived Cowboys savior (Texas A QB Johnny Manziel) {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft. Even Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was uncharacteristically down playing expectations for the upcoming season during spring training, emphasizing to the media and fans, that it might <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time for the Cowboys young players to mature into a NFL championship caliber team.|$|E

When discussing the season's arc, Fox and Warner Brothers wished to have Peter return as soon as possible, as they knew he was popular with fans.

Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated, {{more in tune with}} the 1980s than the 2000s. [...] "My job is to present an entertainment, a world people can visit and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trip," [...] responded Field.|$|E

500|$|Cartwright's normal {{speaking}} {{voice is}} said to have [...] "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For [...] "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.|$|E
500|$|On November 16, 2013, it was {{revealed}} that West would be premiering the music video for [...] "Bound 2" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the following week. The Nick Knight-directed music video was released on November 19, 2013. The video features his then-fiancée Kim Kardashian, topless, riding atop West's motorbike through Monument Valley and other landscapes. Eric Diep of XXL described it as, [...] "a confident display of love and passion with little to no narrative." [...] Spin felt that [...] "a pretty bad idea seen through so completely that it stops being a bad idea". Tom Breihan from Stereogum found the video confusing, saying [...] "it'll <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit to figure out what all's going on there". Lanre Bakare of The Guardian described it as [...] "self-indulgent, idiosyncratic and a bit weird".|$|E

500|$|On release, [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)"'s lyrical affectations {{provoked}} {{comment from}} American reviewers in particular. Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone remarked {{that there were}} [...] "lots of 'Ye's' to remind us it's a ballad", but identified the song {{as part of the}} album's [...] "musical core", the [...] "brooding essays on living, loving, and dying". Village Voice contributor Nicholas Schaffner recognised it as an [...] "olde English ballad" [...] dedicated to what he mistakenly called [...] "George's 17th-century castle". To the NMEs Alan Smith, the track was a [...] "meandering song-tale... which may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer for me to appreciate". Acknowledging that listeners in 1970–71 might have been [...] "mystified" [...] by Harrison's lyrics, Bruce Spizer has written of this [...] "catchy ballad": [...] "its beautiful melody and hook-laden refrain ensured that it {{would be one of the}} album's highlights." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E
500|$|... "Who Do You Love?" [...] {{has been}} {{interpreted}} and recorded by numerous musicians. Folk singer Tom Rush recorded the song for his 1966 album <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Walk with Me. [...] Unterberger describes it as [...] "electric rock... Tom adapted an uncharasteristically low and playful growl for Diddley's 'Who Do You Love,' graced by early fuzz guitar distortion" [...] with the same musicians who backed Dylan in 1965. [...] A single version was released by Rush the same year, which reached number 39 on Billboard magazine's [...] "Top Sellers in Top Markets" [...] chart for Boston on May 14, 1966. [...] A second [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] single by Rush was released in 1971, which appeared at number 105 on Billboard's [...] "Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles" [...] chart. [...] Rush performed the song at the Boston Symphony Hall in December 2012, which is included on his 2013 Celebrates 50 Years of Music album and DVD.|$|E

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
500|$|According to The New York Times, Min turned Us Weekly {{into one}} of the {{magazine}} industry's [...] "major success stories". Public interest in celebrity news was growing, as was the magazine's circulation. In her role at Us Weekly, Min {{had a significant impact on}} popular culture and was influential in creating an industry for celebrity gossip. For example, Us Weekly was largely responsible for the popularity of the reality TV show about a couple with eight children, Jon & Kate Plus 8, after it featured John and Kate on the cover of eight sequential issues. Min focused much of the publication's editorial on reality TV stars, rather than actors and singers. According to Adweek, Min positioned celebrities as the reader's friend who [...] "can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good-natured ribbing" [...] and fostered more cooperative relationships with celebrities. According to Elle, Min depicted celebrities as people that [...] "may make dumb, even craven, moves, but are never villains". According to The Los Angeles Times, Min [...] "softened the tone and made it much more friendly to stars". Min also created a calmer environment in the workplace, which had previously been dramatic and contentious. Under Min's tenure, the publication's circulation grew from 800,000 copies per week in 2000 to 1.9 million by 2009.|$|E

VH1 quoted Armstrong as saying, [...] "We've definitely been talking about someone writing a script for it, and there's been a few different names that have been thrown at us. It sounds really exciting, but for right now it's just talk." [...] Armstrong later stated that filming would begin in 2006, stressing, [...] "We want to see how it turns out first so that it doesn't suck." [...] On June 1, 2006, Armstrong announced in an interview with MTV that the movie [...] "is definitely unfolding" [...] and that [...] "every single week there's more ideas about doing a film for American Idiot, and it's definitely going to happen", but the band later said, [...] "It is gonna <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while." [...] In the summer of 2010, talk about creating a film adaption was brought up again after actor Tom Hanks was interested in producing it.
