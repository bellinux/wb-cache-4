5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E

Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings.

The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This study {{investigated}} utilization of antibacterial agents at <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad, {{in the period}} February - March 2001. Material and methods All antibacterial agents were classified as group J, regarding Anatomic-Therapeutic-Chemical Classification. Data on drug utilization were presented in Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Patients who were under observation were all treated with antibiotics. Results In regard to prescribed treatment in <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, most outpatients were treated with macrolide antibiotics - in 26. 21 %; combination of penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitors in 20. 83 % and pyranosides in 16. 12 %. At <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad, macrolides and lincosamines were most frequently used - in 20. 46 %; cephalosporins in 19. 87 % and penicillins susceptible to beta-lactamase in 18. 85 %. It is extremely positive and in agreement with current pharmacotherapeutic principles that in both institutions peroral ampicillins have not been prescribed. Aminoglycosides have been prescribed in less than 1 % of patients of <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, whereas they were much more frequently prescribed at <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad - in 11. 25 %. Although {{there is a positive}} postantibiotic effect in regard to these antibiotics and it is recommended to use them once a day, in both examined institutions aminoglycosides were given twice a day. In regard to bacterial identification it was done in 80. 76 % of patients of <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Department of the Outpatient Service of the Health Center Novi Sad - Liman, while in <b>the</b> Ear, <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat Clinic of the Clinical Center Novi Sad it was done only in 32. 42 %. Conclusions Although treatment performed on empirical basis and clinical findings is usually correct, a greater percentage of antibiotic prescriptions should be confirmed by antibiograms providing optimal therapy and decreased degree of resistance...|$|R

Soon after, George meets Nicole Collard, a journalist who is photographing the scene. George investigates the area to help Nicole gather information about the attack. He finds the clown's discarded nose, a tissue covered in theatrical greasepaint, {{and a piece of}} fabric from the clown's jacket in the sewers around the cafe and learns that a man was seen escaping with a briefcase. After Nicole discovers the address of a costume shop inside the clown nose, George learns from that shop's owner that <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> theatrical greasepaint had been purchased by a man named Khan.|$|E
5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning {{to the rear of the}} fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E

The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases.

5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924).

His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text Diseases of <b>the</b> <b>Nose</b> <b>and</b> Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology.
