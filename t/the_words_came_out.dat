500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, {{some of which were}} picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{like the}} crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James's defiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to burst into flame, {{but in the end}} Julius lowered his eyes, defeated.|$|E
50|$|In August 1984, {{the station}} {{became part of}} Canada West ROCC. In January 1985 <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that CFS Beausejour's days were numbered. The last day for this prairie radar {{sentinel}} was 31 July 1986.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Helen, 'I {{missed her}} to-day, {{in the midst}} of her little class, bending over them as she used to do, and looking in their faces, as if she saw <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of their mouths.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{perfectly}} wonderful!" [...] murmured Ruth. [...] "He just {{opens his}} mouth and <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> But I knew he was somebody, directly I saw him, by his forehead. Like a dome!" [...] Bailey mopped the dome.|$|R
6000|$|Occupied {{with his}} own emotion, he had not {{observed}} the change in old Heythorp's face. The imperial on that lower lip was bristling, the crimson of those cheeks had spread {{to the roots of}} his white hair. He grasped the arms of his chair, trying to rise; his swollen hands trembled; a little saliva escaped one corner of his lips. And <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> as if shaken by his teeth: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beseech you {{to speak}} quite plainly," [...] said Dorothea, in an imploring tone. [...] "I cannot bear {{to think that}} there might be {{something}} which I did not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act differently." [...] <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> like a cry: it was evident that they were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{with the}} grave {{distinctness}} of his voice, {{and they seemed}} for an instant to create, to poor Mrs. Montgomery's troubled vision, a material image. She gazed at it an instant, and then she turned away. [...] "You distress me, sir!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "He is, after all, my brother, and his talents, his talents--" [...] On these last words her voice quavered, and before he knew it she had burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|Sue {{unlatched}} {{the other}} chamber door, and, as if seized with faintness, sank down outside it. Getting up again she half opened the door, and said [...] "Richard." [...] As <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{of her mouth}} she visibly shuddered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm no disseminator of narratives," [...] said Keogh. [...] "I can use {{language}} {{for purposes of}} speech; but when I attempt a discourse <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as they will, and they may make sense when they strike the atmosphere, or they may not." ...|$|R
60|$|As he {{was nervous}} and had been silent so long that his vocal cords had gone off duty under the {{impression}} that their day's work was over, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of him like a husky gunshot. Mamie started, and the White Hope, who had been sleeping peacefully, stirred and muttered.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in gasps. He {{was like}} a man only partly conscious. The lips were parted, the eyes closed, the head leaning against the high back of the chair. For the space of one second Chauvelin feared that his zeal had outrun his prudence, that he had dealt a death-blow {{to a man in}} the last stage of exhaustion, where he had only wished to fan the {{flickering}} flame of life. Hastily--for the seconds seemed precious--he ran to the opening that led into the guard-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here--now--close upon you!" [...] <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in broken, strenuous speech, {{while the}} lady's fair face was writhed and drawn {{like that of}} one who looks upon a horror which strikes, the words from her lips. Du Guesclin gazed round the tapestried room, at the screens, the tables, the abace, the credence, the buffet with its silver salver, and the half-circle of friendly, {{wondering}} faces. There was an utter stillness, save for the sharp breathing of the Lady Tiphaine and for the gentle soughing of the wind outside, which wafted to their ears the distant call upon a swine-herd's horn.|$|E
6000|$|Susan told Miss Fosbrook so; and {{the boys}} tried to drag her on with a promise of a blackbird's nest; but she thought them unfeeling to such woeful distress, and first tried to reason with Bessie, then to soothe her, till at last, finding all in vain, she thought bed the only place for the child, and led her into the house, helped her, still shaking with sobs, to undress, {{and was going to}} see her lie down in the bed which she shared with Susan. Elizabeth was still young enough to say her prayers aloud. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in the middle of choking sobs, not as if she were much {{attending}} to them. Miss Fosbrook knelt down by her as she was going to rise, and said in her own words, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The uninvited guest," [...] was his greeting. [...] "Is it all over? So?" [...] And he {{swallowed}} Lucile {{up in his}} huge bearskin. [...] "Colonel, your hand, and your pardon for my intruding, and your regrets for not giving me <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>Come,</b> <b>out</b> with them! Hello, Corliss! Captain Alexander, a good day." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} {{very clearly}} than even though I {{had worked for}} ten years with cancer patients, when I called them up (family) and told them I had cancer, the first time <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of my mouth, it didn’t. I said, “The diagnosis is c- ” and I couldn’t say it. It was something that just couldn’t be applying to me...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you really}} do find it {{impossible}} to get on, and Cherry {{is more than just}} ailing, and--and fractious' (<b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> at last); 'I don't like always calling for help, it seems presuming on kindness, and Robina will be helpful when she comes home; but no doubt Alda does not know what to do,' she added, in a deliberating tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not likely}} to see you again," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Will you shake hands"--his lip quivered, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> jerkily--"and let the past die." [...] He held out his hand. Her pale face grew paler, her eyes so dark, rested {{immovably}} on his, her hands remained clasped in front of her. He heard a sound and turned. That boy {{was standing in the}} opening of the curtains. Very queer he looked, hardly recognisable as the young fellow he had seen in the Gallery off Cork Street--very queer; much older, no youth in the face at all--haggard, rigid, his hair ruffled, his eyes deep in his head. Soames made an effort, and said with a lift of his lip, not quite a smile nor quite a sneer: ...|$|E

6000|$|I stood, {{feeling as}} if turned to stone, and {{presently}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in a sob, [...] "Oh, Lucy, he is dead!" [...] and, sinking on the nearest seat, his tempest of grief was for the moment more frightful than the tidings, which I could not take in, so impossible did the sudden quenching of that glorious vitality seem. I began in some foolish {{way to try to}} console him, {{as if it were a}} mere fancy. I brought him a glass of water from the sideboard, and implored him to compose himself, and tell me what made him say such terrible things, but he wrung my hand and leant his head against me, as he groaned, [...] "I tell you, it is true. We buried him this morning. The noblest, dearest friend that ever--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> last <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{with a sort}} {{of double}} expression, betwixt jest and earnest. The tears stood in Cedric's eyes.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Constance!' <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{she hardly}} knew how, as {{something}} {{which at least}} was true. Colonel Mohun knocked {{at the door of}} the room she had come from. It was instantly opened, and Miss Hacket began, 'The poor dear! Can I get anything for her, I am sure it is a terrible shock!' and as he stood, astonished, Gillian added, 'Oh! I see it isn't that. We were afraid it was something about Uncle Maurice.' ...|$|R

"Why, Captain Will {{had just}} come to the Hard--that's to Portsmouth--to speak with mun, and the barge Royal lay again the Hard--so; and our boot alongside--so; and the king he standth {{as it might be}} there, above my head, on the quay edge, and she come in near abreast of us, looking most royal to behold, poor dear! and went to cast about. And Captain Will, saith he, 'Them lower ports is cruel near the water;' for she had not more than a sixteen inches to spare in the nether overloop, as I heard after. And saith he, 'That won't do for going to {{windward}} in a say, Martin.' And as <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of mun's mouth, your worship, {{there was a bit of}} a flaw from the westward, sharp like, and overboard goeth my cap, and hitth against the wall, and as I stooped to pick it up, I heard a cry, and it was all over!" ...|$|E
60|$|A menacing murmur gave {{place to}} the accusing silence. Some there were who gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no {{intention}} of committing social suicide. Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which penetrated to St. Charles Street, came out with a bid. The owner was a seedy man with a straw-colored, drunkard's mustache. He was leaning against the body of Mrs. Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those about him shrank away as from smallpox. His hundred-dollar offer was followed by a hiss. What followed next Stephen will always remember. When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a warning to those that knew him. As he doubled the bid, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life has been used to opposition. He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed himself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to the floor. But there were no hisses now.|$|E

40|$|Tongue-tied Moments? Have {{you ever}} been tongue-tied? Have you {{experienced}} those awkward moments in which you are stuck for words? Or words may come but they {{turn out to be}} inappropriate ones! One of my favourite cartoons from Far Side starts with Tarzan swinging from tree to tree before meeting Jane. In his mind he has been rehearsing what to say in an eloquent, elegant and fluent manner. Now is the crucial moment: <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> “Me Tarzan. You Jane” he gets so  annoyed with himself...|$|E
40|$|Thank you, I feel so {{much more}} like a person now,' I told the ICU nurse after the morning bathing. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> spontaneously, and she was startled. What made me feel 'more like a person' {{at a time when}} my life was at risk, and I was tied to {{machines}} and entirely dependen on others' care? If becoming a patient entails the experience of vulnerability and ultimately the exposure to one's mortality, how does a patient remain a person in the midst of acute illness? Can a patien remain a person if she is regarded primarily as a mal-functioning body and/or mind? To what extent is the patient's self-perception shaped by others' perceptions of her? Can she contribute to the reshaping of those that prove harmful? By arguing for the need to listen to the patient's 'biological and biographical stories' in the interest of good clinical practices, John Launer pinpoints the limitations of a biomedical approach that splits the body from the person, and argues for the need to reconnect biologu and biography within the therapeutic relation. Yet, {{one of the most striking}} conclusions of Robert Klitzman's study on doctors who became patients is the stigmatisation of patienthood among the medical profession. Not only did doctor-patients feel diminished as patients and experienced the dissociation between body and person, but they also complained of the split between body and person thus seems to find a correlate in the physician's split between the professional and the personal, and both may be symptomatic of pervasive cultural practices. This chapter considers the intra- and interpersonal processes whereby the patient seeks to remain a person, and the extent to which this may be facilitated by nurturing therapeutic relationships. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
