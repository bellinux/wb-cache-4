So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{losses were}} modest. The British {{assessed}} that two Japanese aircraft {{had been destroyed}} and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk.

U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached.

25|$|In December 2016, {{two senior}} {{intelligence}} officials <b>told</b> <b>U.S.</b> news media {{that they were}} highly confident that Vladimir Putin personally directed the operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

U.S. officials said that under Putin's direction, the goals evolved from criticizing American democracy to attacking Clinton, and by the fall of 2016 to directly help Trump's campaign, because Putin thought he would ease economic sanctions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Obama foreign policy advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes agreed with this assessment, with Rhodes saying operations of this magnitude required Putin's consent.|$|E
