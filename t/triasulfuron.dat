Induction studies conducted with seedlings of different ages suggest that two separate response pathways modulate this P- 450 activity. Induction by NA is independent of the developmental age of the seedlings up to 6. 5 d; induction by <b>triasulfuron</b> is tightly modulated with respect to developmental age in that <b>triasulfuron</b> metabolism can be induced by <b>triasulfuron</b> in young (2. 5 d) but not older (6. 5 d) seedlings.

The development of injury symptoms was generally slow and was characterized by an initial growth retardation followed by chlorosis and necrosis with death occuring 3 - 4 weeks after application. The herbicide had a flat dose-response curve throughout the investigations. Wheat and barley showed greater tolerance to post-emergence than to pre-emergence applications. Pre-emergence applications of <b>triasulfuron</b> reduced tiller numbers in barley and wheat but application of the herbicide at the 2 - 3 leaf stage stimulated the outgrowth of tiller buds but this effect was temporary and was {{not the result of}} visible physical damage to the shoot meristem. There was no intra-specific variability between cultivars of wheat and barley. Grain yield and other yield components of spring barley were not affected by post-emergence treatments of <b>triasulfuron.</b> <b>Triasulfuron</b> had high activity through the soil and both the roots and subterranean shoots of developing seedlings absorbed the herbicide from the soil.

The amendment of soil with compost may significantly influence the mobility and persistence of pesticides and thus affect their environmental fate.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of the addition of compost made from source-separated municipal waste and green waste, on the fate of <b>triasulfuron</b> [(2 -(2 -chloroethoxy) -N-[[4 -methoxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) amino] carbonyl]benzenesulfonamide], a sulfonylurea herbicide used in postemergence treatment of cereals. Two native soils with low organic matter content were used. A series of analyses was performed to evaluate the adsorption and degradation of the herbicide in soil and in solution after the addition of compost and compost-extracted organic fractions, namely humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (HoDOM). Results have shown that the adsorption of <b>triasulfuron</b> to soil increases in the presence of compost, and that the HA and HoDOM fractions are mainly responsible for this increase. Hydrophobic dissolved organic matter applied to the soils underwent sorption reactions with the soils, and in the sorbed state, served to increase the adsorption capacity of the soil for <b>triasulfuron.</b> The rate of hydrolysis of <b>triasulfuron</b> in solution was significantly higher at acidic pH and the presence of organic matter fractions extracted from compost also slightly increased the rate of hydrolysis. The rate of degradation in amended and nonamended soils is explained by a two-stage degradation kinetics.

Pendimethalin applied pre-emergence (PRE) followed by tralkoxydim applied early post-emergence (EPOST) provided higher control than pendimethalin PRE in both years. Pendimethalin treatments provided higher season-long control in 2000 than in 1999, maintaining at least 80 % control at the last rating in 2000.

40|$|International audienceTo {{elucidate}} the photochemical behavior of two sulfonylureas (cinosulfuron and <b>triasulfuron)</b> {{for which the}} chemical formulas are relatively close, their photodegradation was studied in water. All experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions using a xenon arc lamp {{as the source of}} radiation to simulate environmental conditions. Polychromatic quantum efficiencies were calculated to determine the photochemical pesticide lifetimes at pH 7, and a comparison with hydrolysis lifetimes has been performed. The results obtained showed clearly that at pH 7, photodegradation becomes a more important pathway than chemical degradation. HPLC-DAD was used to study the kinetics for both sulfonylureas and their photoproducts, whereas HPLC-MS (ESI in positive and negative modes) was used to identify photoproducts. These results suggest that the photodegradation of these two sulfonylureas proceeds via a number of reaction pathways: (1) cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge; (2) desulfonylation, which can proceed either by a carbon-sulfur cleavage or a nitrogen-sulfur cleavage; (3) O-demethylation of methoxy moieties present on the triazine ring; and (4) O-dealkylation of benzene derivatives.

This study {{examined}} the fate of three common sulfonylurea herbicides in highly alkaline soils {{through a series of}} laboratory and field experiments to determine if existing leaching models could be used to describe their field behaviour under Australian climatic conditions. A liquid chromatographic method was developed to simultaneously determine levels of <b>triasulfuron,</b> metsulfuronmethyl, and chlorsulfuron in soil and water. The investigation of base hydrolysis for the herbicides in aqueous buffer and soil solutions determined that it was unlikely to be a major loss pathway for sulfonylureas in alkaline soils. The herbicides were found to have low sorption, very little retardation and high mobility, moving at a marginally slower rate than water. Degradation did not follow first-order kinetics, but rather a two-stage process appeared to be involved. Both VARLEACH and LEACHM models predicted the measured concentration of the herbicides reasonably well in profile under low rainfall conditions but were less adequate under high rainfall. Forecasts with the LEACHP model predicted levels of the herbicides for a dominant soil type of the cereal belt of southern Australia with median rainfall after a year. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Each of these P 450 transcripts has distinct developmental, tissue-specific, and chemical cues regulating their expression even when they encode P 450 s within the same biosynthetic pathway. Most notably, the CYP 71 C 1 and CYP 71 C 3 transcripts, encoding P 450 s in the DIMBOA biosynthetic pathway, are induced to the same level in response to wounding and NA treatment of younger seedlings and differentially in response to NA/T treatment of younger seedlings and NA and NA/T treatment of older seedlings. NA and T induce expression of both CYP 92 A 1 and CYP 72 A 5 transcripts in older seedling shoots, whereas phenobarbital induces CYP 92 A 1 expression in older seedling shoots and highly induces CYP 72 A 5 expression in young and older seedling roots.

40|$|CSIRO 2001 A chromatographic model (VARLEACH) and a process-based model (LEACHM) were {{evaluated}} under {{low and high}} water input regimes (‘rainfall’ and ‘rainfall + irrigation’, respectively) using experimental data for a non-reactive tracer (KBr), and 3 sulfonylurea herbicides: <b>triasulfuron,</b> metsulfuron-methyl, and chlorsulfuron. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of predicted and measured water contents revealed that both models performed well under ‘rainfall’, but prediction was less satisfactory under the treatment of ‘rainfall + irrigation’. Both models failed to simulate the bimodal distribution of Br⁻ and the herbicides observed under ‘rainfall + irrigation’ treatment. Distribution of Br - and the 3 herbicides in the profile was over- or under-estimated at certain depths and times, {{probably due to the}} limitations inherent to the models (e. g. inability to deal with the macropore flow), and to simplifications associated with some input data. Simulations for a dry (1 decile), median (5 decile), and wet year (9 decile) with LEACHM and VARLEACH models using long-term weather data for the site showed that leaching and persistence of the herbicides are highly dependent on the amount of rainfall the site receives. The results indicate that the risk of injury to herbicide-sensitive crops in the following year of application of herbicides is likely to be greater when the herbicides are applied in a drier rather than a wetter year.

40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} solute leaching at different times from application in relation to temperature and initial soil moisture. Aggregates of a heavy clay soil were treated with a non-interactive solute (bromide) and the herbicides chlorotoluron, isoproturon and <b>triasulfuron.</b> The soil was incubated at 90 % field capacity and either 5 or 15 oC. The influence of application to initially dry and initially wet aggregates on the behaviour of isoproturon was also investigated. At intervals, samples were either leached in small columns, centrifuged to characterise the fraction of chemical available in pore water under natural moisture conditions or extracted with organic solvents to assess total residues in soil. Bromide concentrations in leachate and in pore water extracted by centrifugation were constant with time. In contrast, availability for leaching and concentration in pore water of the herbicides decreased with increasing time from application in soil incubated at 15 oC. The effect of residence time was much smaller at 5 than at 15 oC. At the higher temperature, pesticide concentrations in leachate and pore water declined faster than would be expected from degradation alone, probably due to slow diffusion of the pesticides into soil aggregates where they are less available for leaching and/or slow sorption-desorption. The faster decline in availability for leaching at 15 than at 5 oC was attributed to faster degradation of the readily available fraction. There was no significant influence of initial soil moisture on either the leaching behaviour of isoproturon or its availability in soil water...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of <b>triasulfuron,</b> metsulfuron-methyl and chlorsulfuron in {{aqueous buffer}} solutions and in soil suspensions at pH values ranging from 5. 2 to 11. 2 was investigated. Hydrolysis {{of all three}} compounds in both aqueous buffer and soil suspensions was highly pH-sensitive. The rate of hydrolysis was much faster in the acidic pH range (5. 2 - 6. 2) than under neutral and moderately alkaline conditions (8. 2 - 9. 4), but it increased rapidly as the pH exceeded 10. 2. All three compounds degraded faster at pH 5. 2 than at pH 11. 2. Hydrolysis rates of all three compounds could be described well with pseudo-first-order kinetics. There {{were no significant differences}} (P = 0. 05) in the rate constants (k, day- 1) of the three compounds in soil suspensions from those in buffer solutions within the pH ranges studied. A functional relationship based on the propensity of nonionic and anionic species of the herbicides to hydrolyse was used to describe the dependence of the 'rate constant' on pH. The hydrolysis involving attack by neutral water was at least 100 -fold faster when the sulfonylurea herbicides were undissociated (acidic conditions) than when they were present as the anion at near neutral pH. In aqueous buffer solution at pH > 11, a prominent degradation pathway involved O-demethylation of metsulfuron-methyl to yield a highly polar degradate, and hydrolytic opening of the triazine ring.

Treated areas were sown back to sorghum in the following spring, to sorghum and sunflower in summer, and to chickpea in the following autumn. Shoot dry matter at 3 weeks after emergence and grain yields were measured. Soil residue levels of chlorsulfuron were measured by bioassay following herbicide application and at sowing of sorghum and chickpea. Rainfall and temperature were recorded for each fallow period. The recropping intervals ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 1 months for spring sorghum, 2. 5 to 9. 3 months for summer sorghum and sunflower, and 5. 7 to 11. 7 months for chickpea. The shorter intervals were {{a consequence of the}} late spring applications. The spring sorghum crops were significantly injured by all herbicides, when chlorsulfuron residues at sowing ranged from 1. 67 to 2. 1 ng/g in the surface 15 cm. Summer sorghum, sunflower and chickpea were unaffected by any herbicide treatment, except the covered (rainfall excluded) metsulfuron methyl treatment. Despite the differences in recropping intervals and fallow rain, all summer sorghum crops were sown into low chlorsulfuron residues (ranged from non-detectable to 0. 2 ng/g). Similarly, residues measured at chickpea sowing ranged from non-detectable to 0. 1 ng/g. The lack of crop response and the low levels of detected herbicide residue indicate that in this environment these herbicides dissipate rapidly, and the safe recropping intervals are much shorter than currently recommended on herbicide labels...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to develop recommendations for safe re-cropping following chlorsulfuron, <b>triasulfuron,</b> and metsulfuron-methyl specific for the different soils and climates of this region. Seedling dry matter (SDM) and grain yield were measured at 17 sites over 4 seasons. Soils were ferrosols (pH 5. 5 - 6. 8), sodosols (pH 6. 6 - 7. 1), and vertosols (pH 7. 8 - 9. 0). Sorghum and sunflower were sown at plant-backs between 2 and 20 months, and chickpea at 10 - 13 months, after applications of sulfonylurea herbicides. Seedling response of the summer crops to these herbicides was substantially different for the 3 soils. Crop response in the ferrosols was largely unaffected by plant-back, soil, or climatic factors after a minimum of 2 - 3 months. In contrast, response of summer crops in the vertosols and sodosols was strongly affected by plant-backs for up to 10 months, and SDM was more affected in sodosols than in vertosols. Predictive relationships between SDM and plant-back, cumulative temperature, and measured chlorsulfuron residues were developed for sowing summer crops in these soils. In ferrosols and vertosols, chickpea was unaffected by any treatment following plant-back of 10 - 12 months. These findings indicate that shorter re-cropping is possible in this region than currently recommended. However, the decision should be based not only on plant-back, but on soil type, cumulative temperature, and possibly even residue level in soil. These more specific recommendations will improve the safety and flexibility of re-cropping following applications of sulfonylurea herbicides in this region...|$|E

In 2015 SUs were applied in pre-transplant at one third of D, and in post-transplant at the dose D, at onehalf and at one-fourth of D, delivered in 3 rates by drip herbigation. In both experiments RS gave the best broomrape control and the highest yield increase compared with the untreated crop and CS improved crop yield similarly to RS despite being less effective in contrasting branched broomrape, In 2014, the foliar application of TS and CS resulted in plant injuries which, more significantly with TS, caused lower numbers and fresh weight of fruits {{as well as a}} lower crop productivity increase. In the same year the drip herbigation with TS resulted in the lowest broomrape control and tomato yield increase.

Analyte detection has been performed by a diode-array detector operated in tandem mode with either an electrochemical detector or a fluorescence detector placed after a two-stage post-column derivatization system. Using 100 mL sample volume the recoveries of most solutes, except for the highly polar and highly hydrophobic compounds, were better than 80 _%; the recoveries of the highly polar compounds (aniline, clopyralid, picloram, hydroxysimazine, hydroxyatrazine and phenol) were lower than 80 % due to their early breakthrough from the solid-phase extraction cartridges, while for the highly hydrophobic compounds the reduced recoveries were attributed to their adsorption onto the surfaces of the analytical equipment. Analyte detection limits, calculated by analyzing spiked river water samples, were better than 0. 1 _μg/L, which is the maximum acceptable concentration of pesticide parent compounds and phenols in drinking water according to the EU Directive 778 / 80. The proposed {{analytical method}} was applied to study the stability {{of a wide range}} of herbicides during sample storage for a period of three months as a function of storage temperature (refrigeration and 20 _ 0 C), sample pH (3 and 7) and acidification medium (sulfuric and ortho-phosphoric acid). Many of the compounds were found to be unstable in water, while sample storage conditions had significant effect on their stability. Among the compounds exhibiting high degree of instability were propanil, when stored under neutral conditions, diclofop-methyl, fluazifop-butyl, dinitroanilines, tralkoxydim and <b>triasulfuron,</b> when stored under acidic conditions, clopyralid, metamitron, metribuzin along with its conversion products and 2, 4 -DB, when water samples were stored at 20 _ 0 C. The stability of the above studied herbicides has been also evaluated under sorbed conditions, when water samples were processed by solid-phase extraction and the respective cartridges were stored for a period of three months under deep freeze, refrigeration or at 20 _ 0 C. Most compounds, expect for the highly polar analytes, exhibited higher stability under sorbed conditions than when being in solution of an aqueous medium. The stability of the highly polar analytes such as clopyralid, picloram, hydroxysimazine, imazapyr, metolachlor-sulfonic_acid, diketometribuzin, desaminodiketometribuzin, desaminometribuzin and metribuzin decreased significantly during storage under sorbed conditions, even though clopyralid was still more stable than when being in solution. Storage temperature and storage time had significant effect not only on herbicide stability but also on their chromatographic performance during analysis. xiii...|$|E
