5|$|On August 6, 2001, one of {{the trains}} failed {{to stop at the}} ride's brake run, colliding with the other train in <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> station. 22 people were sent to hospitals, without any major injuries. The ride reopened on August 18, 2001.|$|E
30|$|As a {{harmonic}} <b>load</b> {{moves along}} <b>the</b> rail, vibration wave are {{generated in the}} rail ahead and behind <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> Due to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> speed, <b>the</b> wave ahead <b>the</b> <b>load</b> {{is different from that}} behind <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> not only in amplitude, but also in wavelength and decay rate. The wave behind <b>the</b> <b>load</b> exhibits, more or less, higher amplitude, longer wavelength and less decay rate than the wave ahead <b>the</b> <b>load.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pload is {{the maximum}} time {{averaged}} power delivered to <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> where <b>the</b> maximization is over <b>the</b> <b>load</b> impedance, i.e., we desire <b>the</b> <b>load</b> impedance which maximizes the time averaged power delivered to <b>the</b> <b>load.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>load</b> {{estimator}} determines <b>the</b> total controlled {{water heating}} load by applying a switching program to uncontrolled loads of individual households. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> estimator sets <b>the</b> <b>load</b> to zero during the turn-off periods of the applied switching program and restores <b>the</b> <b>load</b> during <b>the</b> turn-on periods. Water temperature {{is not considered}} in <b>the</b> <b>load</b> estimation.|$|R
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, found in <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> screens before a race. This move {{was met with}} criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> station.|$|E
5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
50|$|The FWD is {{designed}} to impart a <b>load</b> pulse to <b>the</b> pavement surface which simulates <b>the</b> <b>load</b> produced by a rolling vehicle wheel. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> is produced by dropping a large weight, and transmitted to the pavement through a circular load plate - typically 300 mm diameter on roads and 450 mm on airports. A load cell mounted on top of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> plate measures <b>the</b> <b>load</b> imparted to <b>the</b> pavement surface. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> plate can be solid or segmented. The advantage of a segmented load plate is that it adopts {{to the shape of}} the pavement, giving an even distribution of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> on uneven surfaces. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> for road testing is about 50 kN giving about 700 kPa pressure under <b>the</b> <b>load</b> plate.|$|R
5000|$|The Voltage Regulation formula {{could be}} visualized with the following: [...] "Consider power being {{delivered}} to a <b>load</b> such that <b>the</b> voltage at <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is <b>the</b> <b>load's</b> rated voltage VRated, if then <b>the</b> <b>load</b> disappears, <b>the</b> voltage {{at the point of}} <b>the</b> <b>load</b> will rise to Vnl." ...|$|R

5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric multiple units built to the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also built to fit <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> gauge. The diesel-electric multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. PT boats did not sortie {{to attack}} Hashimoto's force this night and <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> went uneventfully. The Reinforcement Force {{embarked}} Hyakutake, his staff, and 3,921 men, {{mainly from the}} 2nd Division, and reached Bougainville without incident by 12:50 on 5 February. A CAF airstrike launched that morning failed to locate Hashimoto's force.|$|E
5|$|The canal had {{to contend}} with initial {{opposition}} from the carters, who used force to prevent coal being taken from the pits to <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> points. However, the canal provided a greatly superior method of transporting coal and was an immediate success. In 1782 it earned 114,000 livres. The Compagnie du canal de Givors was established in December 1788 to take over operations. In letters-patent of December 1788, registered on 5 September 1789, the concession was declared to be permanent.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (<b>the</b> <b>loading</b> dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, one for {{unloading}} {{and one for}} loading. Two trains are loaded and unloaded while the third train is running the course. There is also a separate line in the station where riders can wait for the first seat. <b>The</b> <b>loading</b> platform has red overhead lights, which are located above the train. Millennium Force's theme song is played in the station while riders are boarding.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> are {{guaranteed}} to be symmetrical, some of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> cells can be substituted with pivots. This saves the cost of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> cell but can significantly decrease accuracy.|$|R
30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>load</b> {{grouping}} process, an EWH load may {{be inferred}} {{to belong to}} one of the following three groups: group B, group C and group D. <b>The</b> EWH <b>loads</b> in <b>the</b> group B can respond to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> increase task. <b>The</b> EWH <b>loads</b> in <b>the</b> group D can respond to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> curtailment task. <b>The</b> EWH <b>loads</b> in <b>the</b> group C can’t respond to any task.|$|R

5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> of munitions and very little experience in handling them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, <b>the</b> total <b>load</b> of {{nitrogen}} in Muddy Run from groundwater was 14221 lb. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> from row crops was 1588 lb and <b>the</b> <b>load</b> from hay and pastures was 983 lb. <b>The</b> nitrogen <b>load</b> from low-density urban development was 85 lb, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> from unpaved roads was 45 lb, and <b>the</b> <b>load</b> from septic systems was 44 lb. A total of 7 lb came from streambank erosion and 431 lb came from other sources.|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> {{resistance}} {{is often not}} known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with <b>the</b> <b>load</b> could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on <b>the</b> <b>load.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> pullout <b>load</b> {{is applied}} and {{controlled}} by equipping mechanical jack and load cell.

5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion {{could have been an}} accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived {{off the island}} at 05:45 {{on the morning of}} 27December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
