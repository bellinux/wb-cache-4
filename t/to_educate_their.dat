5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>their</b> sons during their earliest youth.

25|$|Experience {{was also}} a key element to {{learning}} for Montaigne.

For this reason he encouraged tutors <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>their</b> students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of bargaining {{on a national}} basis, while restraining local unions from striking, also tended to accelerate the trend toward bureaucracy within the larger CIO unions. Some, such as the Steelworkers, had always been centralized organizations in which authority for major decisions resided at the top. The UAW, by contrast, {{had always been a}} more grassroots organization, but it also started to try to rein in its maverick local leadership during these years. The CIO also had to confront deep racial divides in its own membership, particularly in the UAW plants in Detroit where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs, but also in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in further left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU, and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes, <b>to</b> <b>educate</b> <b>their</b> membership, and to support the Roosevelt Administration's tentative efforts to remedy racial discrimination in war industries through the Fair Employment Practices Commission. Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL.|$|E
