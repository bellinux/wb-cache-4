Bat Out of Hell and Meat Loaf collaborators Todd Rundgren, Eric Troyer, Rory Dodd, Glen Burtnick and Kasim Sulton provided backing vocals. An edited version of the song was then released on Dion's album All <b>the</b> <b>Way...</b> <b>A</b> Decade of Song.

5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>a</b> rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> splash breaks into droplets and compares {{this to the}} shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>way</b> that we {{see other}} people express their {{emotions}} or feelings determines how we respond. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>an</b> individual responds to a situation is based on feeling rules.

If they had no knowledge of the situation, then their response may be indifference. A lack of knowledge or information about an event can shape <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>an</b> individual sees things and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they respond.|$|R

5|$|Nigel Dick {{directed}} the music video for Dion's version, with Simon Archer as cinematographer and Jaromir Svarc as art director. It was shot between 29 June and 3 July 1996 {{in the summer}} palace of the Austrian Emperor, Ploskovice and Barandov Studios, Prague, Czech Republic; it was later released in July 1996. Castle Ploskovice in Ploskovice supplied {{the exterior of the}} gothic mansion. There are two versions of this music video; the full version (about 7:44 in length) and the single version (about 6:00 in length).

They had picked up a hitchhiker on <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>a</b> human called Barry Waddle. Suddenly the ship found itself some 200 light years away from its previous location and a hundred years in the past, near Deep Space Station K7 and found the USS Enterprise in orbit. They discover that the hitch-hiker was Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), a Klingon agent who had previously been caught by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) on K7 whilst trying to poison a shipment of grain.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position {{on the right of}} Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men and started down the mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>A</b> carrying party of Korean A-frame porters led by an American officer had started up the mountain during the morning with supplies.

5|$|A {{young boy}} named Cooper and his girlfriend, Amber, are seen searching frantically for {{civilisation}} after {{they take a}} wrong turn. They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber {{is nowhere to be}} seen in the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>a</b> huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} from the frontlines after {{a brief period of}} recovery at the Kaponga Box. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ray Lynch due to Gray being promoted to brigadier and given command of the 4th Brigade, it served as security for the divisional headquarters from late June to early July as the entire division relocated several times during this period. On the evening of 14 July, the battalion, now back with its parent brigade, was part of the attack on Ruweisat Ridge, held by the enemy. Although an Italian strongpoint caused the battalion to scatter in piecemeal fashion, it advanced to the western end of the ridge taking several prisoners on <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>A</b> German counterattack in the afternoon of 15 July which overwhelmed the 19th and 20th Battalions also caused heavy losses amongst the 18th Battalion, including Lynch, but many men were able to return to the Allied lines. Following the effective destruction of the 19th and 20th Battalions, the 18th Battalion remained in the field attached to the 5th Brigade. It then supported an attack by the 6th Brigade on El Mreir. Inadequately supported by armour, the attack proved a failure although the battalion escaped with relatively few casualties. It remained in the line throughout August and into September at which time, having been reduced to just 350 personnel, it was withdrawn to Maadi to rejoin the reconstituted 4th Brigade.|$|E
