"Say My Name" [...] {{marked the}} group's first {{collaboration}} with American producer-songwriter Rodney Jerkins, {{who was one}} out of several people hired to work with Destiny's Child on their second album. When they wrote the song however, lead singer Beyoncé Knowles was initially displeased with the track they were working on. She commented that there was [...] "too much stuff" [...] on the track and {{it sounded like a}} [...] "jungle". During the photo shoot for the album, Beyoncé's father-manager Mathew Knowles went to the studio informing her that Jerkins reworked on the track she [...] "hated".

5000|$|The synth {{line was}} written around 1981 by Eddie Van Halen {{but it was}} refused by {{the other members of}} the band. In 1983, {{producer}} Ted Templeman asked Roth to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the unused song idea. Riding around in the back of his 1951 Mercury, with band roadie Larry Hostler driving, Roth listened repeatedly to the song. To come up with a lyric for it, he remembered seeing a television news report the night before about a man who was threatening to commit suicide by jumping off of a high building. Roth thought that one of the onlookers of such a scene would probably shout [...] "go ahead and jump". Roth bounced this suggestion off Hostler who agreed it was good. Instead of being about a threatened suicide, the words were written as an invitation to love. Roth later told Musician magazine that Hostler was [...] "probably the most responsible for how it came out." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{echoes of}} the Beijing Olympics have been soundly drowned out, at least in US medialand, by the Democratic Convention. Even so, there’s {{still a lot of}} good and {{interesting}} coverage and reflections on the Beijing spectacle. Here are a few of our favorites. 1. For a variety of takes on the closing ceremony, see Danwei’s wrap-up. 2. In case you missed them, here are Xinhua’s pictures of a sweaty President Bushchatting with the eventual gold medalists in women’s beach volleyball. 3. Mary Beard at TLS wrote two recent pieces on the Olympics that may be of interest–both written from a classicist’s perspective, the first beginning from the premise of how London will possibly live up to Beijing’s show, while the second a tongue-in-cheek reflection on Greek Olympic traditions. 4. For those tracking superstitions in 2008 (like the earthquake premonitions and the Olympic harbingers of doom), Shanghaiist is keeping up on connections between the earthquake and the Chinese medal count. 5. After all the mentions in the media {{over the last few weeks}} of the massive mobilization of humans necessary for the Olympic performances (a mobilization made possible, commentators implied or sometimes said, because China is an autocratic regime), Jamie Metzl of the Asia Society urges in FEER that liberal democracies need to go toe-to-toe with Beijing’s technocrats and prove that liberal democracies can also put on a good show. (Is that the acrid smell of Cold War in the air?) At openDemocracy, Kerry Brown argues that the Olympics have already changed China in ways that matter.

5000|$|Donald A.

This 1976 album allowed him to give full vent to his romantic thoughts via lushly crafted songs about the travails of love. Harley's ambitions occasionally overwhelm him, but the best songs rank with Harley's finest work and the album manages to overcome its occasional excesses thanks to a crisp, consistent production that keeps its genre-hopping sounding smooth. In short, it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> few <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> assimilate, {{but it is an}} impressively crafted album that offers plenty of rewards for Harley fans and anyone who can appreciate glam rock at its most artsy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{has been}} met with highly {{positive}} reviews since its release. Reviewers praised the band's cohesive sound, Walsh's vocals, and the lyricism.

The negative comments are directed at the album's length and lack of technical instrumentals. Having written a positive review, a reviewer for AbsolutePunk commented that, [...] "This band definitely has direction, but the record is a bit lengthy. Because of that, some songs can get lost in the mix.

5000|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{found that}} [...] "after 2008's ballad-packed Human, Brandy has opted for an {{altogether}} bouncier sound {{for the lead}} cut from her new album Two Eleven.

[...] Mesfin Fekadu from San Francisco Chronicle felt that the record was [...] "full of swag {{and one of the}} year's best thanks to its addictive beat." [...] Andy Kellman from Allmusic declared the song [...] "Two Elevens most upbeat and commercial song" [...] and felt it stuck [...] "out on an album dominated by aching ballads and grown slow jams".

An {{interview}} for Modern Drummer stated that Crago recalled of [...] "turning white, almost contracted immediate stomachache with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea".

5000|$|Professor Robin Ridington {{came across}} {{stories of the}} wechuge while {{speaking}} with the Dane-zaa of the Peace River region in western Canada.

Examples of these taboos include a person having <b>a</b> photo <b>taken</b> with <b>a</b> flash, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> music made with a stretched string or hide (hence guitar music), or eating meat with fly eggs in it.

5000|$|PopMatters {{correspondent}} Will Layman said [...] "The {{sense of}} parody, exaggeration, and pastiche is dead-on brilliant, {{at least the}} first time you hear the disc... The small details of Shelf-Life are utterly worth revisiting. Each time it sounds a bit less jammy and more organized. But it repays the kind of <b>listens</b> it’s hard <b>to</b> give in life—long, hard, sustained listens. If you’ve got the time and the inclination, well—Uri Caine has just the album for you". In his review for Allmusic, Scott Yanow notes that [...] "This set <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> few <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> sort out, and it will either be loved or hated by jazz listeners, depending on their feelings toward electronic sounds". [...] All About Jazz said [...] "Depending on your personal tastes and breadth of exposure, the rapid and regular shifts in mood, style, and era on Shelf-Life may be energizing or disconcerting—probably a combination of the two. As for me, it all adds up to pure joy, in no small part due to the music's unpredictability. Caine, Danziger, and Lefebvre are not so reckless as to ever lose control, so individual tracks may wander a bit, but they never get lost. And that's absolutely key. Tightness is a virtue".|$|R

[...] "Bunty Aur Babli does not contain your routine Yash Chopra genre of music that are choreographed around the meadows and Swiss alps. They are more of situational rhythmic tracks that <b>take</b> <b>a</b> story forward" [...] Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama said in his review. The Glamsham was full of praise for the lyrics by Gulzar, [...] "Throughout this zany zingy and zippy album the 70-year-old Gulzar imbues a youthfulness that comes from being young at heart. Indeed that's the quality, which flows freely out of this album. You can't miss its zest for life… or its lunge towards a luscious nirvana obtained from looking at life through rose-tinted glasses." [...] Avijit Ghosh wrote in The Telegraph, [...] "In essence, Bunty Aur Babli is an on-the-road flick about a boy and girl in search of fun and freedom rather than a story of two cons.

[...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button.
