5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. To the surprise of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> {{this case}} were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, {{which was a}} temple in the Serangoon area of Singapore espousing Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist teachings. The temple property, which was located {{near the site of}} the Bartley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station, was compulsorily {{acquired}} pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act. The Government Gazette notification relating to the acquisition published on 20 January 2003 specified that the temple property (together with another piece of land nearby) had been acquired for the construction and comprehensive redevelopment of the Mass Rapid Transit's Circle Line.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1801, President John Adams's {{last day}} in office, Adams {{nominated}} and the Senate confirmed 20 D.C. justices {{of the peace}} for Washington County and 19 for Alexandria County. On March 16, President Thomas Jefferson issued 15 commissions to justices of the peace in Washington County, including 13 nominated by Adams, and 15 in Alexandria County, including 11 nominated by Adams; the remainder were of his own choosing. (Jefferson's list, submitted to the Senate on January 6, 1802, erroneously contained the name of John Laird, a confirmed Adams appointed who had not received a commission from Jefferson, instead of More.) <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> Marbury v.

5|$|Super v. Work (1926) {{involved}} {{a challenge in}} the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now known as the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) {{to the construction of}} federal hydroelectric dams in California. The plaintiffs, members of the Karuk and Peh-tsick tribes, alleged both that the dams would violate their aboriginal title rights and their rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that both rights (if they existed) were extinguished by the 1851 statute. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> Barker, who were Mission Indians, the plaintiffs here were nomadic {{at the time of the}} relevant times.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the first}} freedom suits, court cases in the British Isles to {{challenge}} the legality of slavery, took place in Scotland in 1755 and 1769. The cases were Montgomery v.

They set the precedent of legal procedure in British courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b> <b>In</b> these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.|$|E

Arguing before the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Sumner noted that schools for blacks were physically inferior and that segregation bred harmful psychological and sociological effects—arguments that would be made in Brown v.
