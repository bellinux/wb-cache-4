5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm was {{inspired}} by a passage in Thomas Gray's poem <b>The</b> <b>Bard.</b> The theme of <b>The</b> <b>Bard</b> was the English king Edward I's conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh bard upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson Richard II.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson {{founded the}} Children's High Level Group (now Lumos). In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to {{highlight}} the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children. To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard,</b> a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for £1.95million by on-line bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction. Rowling gave away the remaining six copies {{to those who have}} a close connection with the Harry Potter books. In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos. On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative – Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos. In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard,</b> totalling nearly £19 million.|$|E

5|$|The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> {{is a book}} of children's {{stories by}} British author J. K. Rowling. There is a storybook {{of the same name}} {{mentioned}} in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book of the Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|The first 26 (numbered) {{pages of}} the {{manuscript}} paper for the pre-Oceanides suite are missing; assuming the first page would have been reserved for the title, {{this means that the}} missing first movement likely consisted of 25 pages. Importantly, the fair copy of the final version of <b>The</b> <b>Bard</b> is about the same length (26 pages).|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2008, it was {{announced}} The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> would also be made available for the public, in both standard and collector's editions. The book was published by Children's High Level Group and printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Amazon.com. The decision was taken due to disappointment among Harry Potter fans after it had initially been announced a wide public release was not intended.|$|E
50|$|Cranford is {{best known}} as a game {{designer}} and game programmer. He was the designer and programmer of 1985's <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale and 1986's <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale II: <b>The</b> Destiny Knight role-playing video games published by Interplay Productions. He also programmed the Apple version of Donkey Kong, the Commodore 64 version of Super Zaxxon, as well as Maze Master (a spiritual predecessor of <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale). His last video game was Centauri Alliance for Brøderbund in 1990. He left the video game industry to pursue graduate studies, and thus was not involved in the creation of 1988's <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale III. Almost thirty years later, however, he was approached by inXile Entertainment to assist with the development of <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale IV and had agreed to provide feedback and advice for the new game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale II: <b>The</b> Destiny Knight is {{a fantasy}} {{role-playing}} video game created by Interplay Productions in 1986. It {{is the first}} sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale, and <b>the</b> last game of the series that was designed and programmed by Michael Cranford.|$|R
50|$|It {{also offered}} the player the {{opportunity}} to continue their characters from previous games such as Phantasie I, III, <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale and <b>The</b> <b>Bard's</b> Tale II: <b>The</b> Destiny Knight, although Faerghail does not {{take place in the}} same fictional world as these games.|$|R
5|$|Originally The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> {{had only}} been {{produced}} in {{a limited number of}} seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished using a different semiprecious stone.|$|E
5|$|Six {{of these}} {{original}} handwritten copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six {{people who were}} most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two {{of these people have}} been named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> exhibits in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> first {{appeared}} as a fictional book in J. K. Rowling's 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel of the Harry Potter series. The book is bequeathed to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, former headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It {{is described as a}} popular collection of Wizarding children's fairy tales, so that while Ron Weasley is familiar with the stories, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had not previously heard of them due to their non-magical upbringing.|$|E

5|$|When Etty {{exhibited}} {{the completed painting}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832, it was shown untitled, with the relevant six lines from <b>The</b> <b>Bard</b> attached; writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its incipit of Fair Laughs the Morn. By the time of Etty's death in 1849, it had acquired its present title of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm.|$|E
5|$|Bayan, {{named after}} <b>the</b> <b>bard</b> Boyan, {{had to be}} ordered in May 1898 from the French {{shipyard}} Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer {{because there was no}} capacity available in Russian shipyards. The ship was laid down in February 1899 and launched on 12 June 1900. Bayan was completed in February 1903 and, under the command of Captain 1st Rank Robert Wiren, made port visits in Greece, Italy and North Africa before sailing for Kronstadt. Arriving in April 1903, she was only there for several months before departing for Port Arthur on 7 August. Together with the French-built battleship , Bayan arrived on 2 December and they were both assigned to the First Pacific Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. <b>The</b> <b>Bard</b> was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} works by <b>the</b> <b>bard</b> Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen; Iolo may have studied at the Bangor Priory. Tudur Hen's most significant legacy was his name. The naming practice {{of the time in}} Wales was to attach the father's name to the new first name, thus his son was named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. Goronwy had children, one of whom was named Tudur, becoming another Tudur ap Goronwy. The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service, and he was the grandfather (through Maredudd ap Tudur) of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur. Owain anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the Royal House of Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages (two {{other books}} {{mentioned}} in the Harry Potter novels that have also been printed) the standard and collector's editions of The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard</b> feature commentary and footnotes from Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts {{and one of the}} main characters of the series. The standard edition also includes illustrations reproduced from the handwritten edition auctioned in December 2007 and the introduction by the author. The limited collector's edition features ten illustrations by J.K. Rowling not included in the standard edition or the original handcrafted edition, as well as an exclusive reproduction of J.K. Rowling's handwritten introduction, and other miscellaneous objects such as replica gemstones and an emerald ribbon.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (also {{known as}} Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem <b>The</b> <b>Bard</b> in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E

5|$|Rowling has {{expanded}} the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds {{from the sale}} of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle <b>the</b> <b>Bard,</b> a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned {{to raise money for the}} Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.|$|E

The next day Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledore's will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry.

5|$|In the 5th century, {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the Roman legions, Saint Illtud came to the Hodnant valley from Brittany and founded the monastery of Illtud on the Ogney Brook, and a college, close to the current St Illtyd's Church, about a mile from the sea. The exact date of its founding is unknown, but some sources indicate around the year 500; the blue plaque on the church today also gives this date. Because of its monastery and teaching centre it became a major centre for education and Celtic Church evangelism, attracting scholars from across Wales, Devon, Cornwall and Brittany and the wider world. The college of Llantwit, known as the College or Seminary of Theodosius (Cor Tewdws in Welsh) or College of St. Illtyd, at its peak reputedly had seven halls, over 400 houses and over 2000 students, including seven sons of British princes, and scholars such as St. Patrick, St. Paul Aurelian, <b>the</b> <b>bard</b> Taliesin, Gildas the historian, Samson of Dol, Paulinus, Bishop of Leon; St. David is believed to have spent some time there. Samson was known to have been summoned by Dyfrig to join the monastery in 521 and he was briefly elected abbot before leaving for Cornwall. King Hywel ap Rhys (d. 886) was buried at the monastery.|$|E
