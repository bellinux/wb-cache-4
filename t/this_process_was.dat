But <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers who sought to {{strengthen}} the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit, and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> intensified, with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a police state.|$|E

5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E
5|$|Mammoths {{continued}} growing during adulthood, as {{do other}} elephants. Males grew until age 40, and females until age 25. Mammoths {{may have had}} gestation periods of 21–22 months, like those of modern elephants. Columbian mammoths had six sets of molars {{in the course of}} a lifetime. At 6–12 months the second set of molars would erupt, with the first set worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for ten years, and <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> repeated until the sixth set emerged at 30 years of age. When the last set of molars wore out the animal would be unable to chew, and would die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> {{developed in}} 1982 by Ronald Ower {{with what he}} thought was Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E

5|$|On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago {{and joined}} the {{chemistry}} group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was {{to figure out how}} to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide. The zinc oxide {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from {{the second half of the}} first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, <b>this</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> <b>was</b> first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E
