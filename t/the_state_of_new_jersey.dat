5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|The 1903 New Jersey {{hurricane}}, {{also known}} as the Vagabond Hurricane by The Press of Atlantic City, is the first and only known North Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> since records were kept starting in 1851. The fourth hurricane of the season, the cyclone was first observed on September 12 about 550miles (885kilometres) northeast of Antigua. It moved quickly westward, then later turned to the north-northwest, steadily strengthening to reach a peak intensity of 100miles per hour (155kilometres per hour), a Category2 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane weakened slightly before striking near Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 16 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It weakened over Pennsylvania and became an extratropical cyclone over western New York on September 17.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to state standards for $300 (1916USD). In1923, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing Township was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.|$|E

The east end {{is in the middle}} of the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River in Fort Lee, Bergen County while the route is concurrent with I-95 and US1-9. Throughout much of its length, US 46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US 46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near freeway standards and many other sections arterials with jughandles. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including Hackettstown, Netcong, Dover, Parsippany-Troy Hills, Wayne, Clifton, Ridgefield Park, Palisades Park, and Fort Lee. The road has been ceremonially named the United Spanishâ€“American War Veterans Memorial Highway.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism.

5|$|The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011â€“12 {{enrollment}} of 306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a studentâ€“teacher ratio of 11.77:1. TCCS is {{a charter school}} that operates independently of the Teaneck Public Schools under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education, which was renewed for five years in 2012. Admission {{is open to the}} public for available slots (after returning students and siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program and summer camp. As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b> The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009â€“10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City â€“ Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
