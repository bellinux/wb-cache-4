40|$|Abstract: The mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cryptorhynchus mangiferae (F.), has {{prevented}} {{the export of}} mangoes from Hawaii to the U. S. mainland for over 50 years {{because there were no}} approved quarantine treatments to control this pest. Irradiation was explored as a method to prevent adult emergence in, or to sterilize, mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil.</b> Mixed-age mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> in mangoes were irradiated with target doses of 50, 100, or 300 Gy and held for adult emergence. The 300 Gy treatment (dose range 180 â€“ 310 Gy) did not prevent adult emergence. Emerging adults from the 100 and 300 Gy treatments were lethargic and short-lived, and laid no eggs indicating sterility. An irradiation quar-antine treatment (100 Gy) to sterilize mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> in mangoes has been pro-posed. Approval of this treatment will open U.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the thermodynamic properties of the process of water sorption in forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds.</b> The equilibrium moisture content of forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> was determined by the gravimetric-dynamic method for different values of temperature and water activity. According to the results, increasing the moisture content increases the energy required for the evaporation of water in forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds,</b> and the values of integral isosteric heat of desorption, within the moisture content range of 3. 33 to 11. 30 (% d. b.), varies from 4, 222. 70 to 2, 870. 34 kJ kg- 1. With the elevation in the equilibrium moisture content, there is an increase in differential entropy and Gibbs free energy, which has positive values, demonstrating non-spontaneity in the process of desorption in the seeds. The theory of enthalpy-entropy compensation can be satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon, and the process of water desorption of forage <b>turnip</b> <b>seeds</b> is controlled by enthalpy...|$|R

We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and population structures of red and gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations collected {{on either side of the}} Rocky Mountains using nuclear 18 S rDNA, mitochondrial ribosomal DNA, and microsatellites. The results showed that the sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> are sister taxa in a monophyletic clade. No significant relationships attributable to geographic barriers were found. Thirty-three unique mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences (haplotypes) were identified and the sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 68 %. Because more individuals per population could be collected for gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> than for red, a more detailed study of population structure was possible for this species. Most of the genetic variation observed in gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted from variation within populations. Contiguous range expansion appeared to be the main mechanism for increased variability within the species. Significant differences were found in analyses of five polymorphic microsatellite loci in four geographically separated field populations from which multiple individuals could be collected. More genetic differences occurred among weevil populations collected from sunflowers along the East-West axis than among weevil populations collected on a North-South axis. The overall results are consistent with current theories concerning the origin of the sunflower. The population represented by haplotype 33 from Texas is likely a new species that evolved independently. The sample size for this species was limited and additional studies are needed. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking achenes of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of achenes damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). Achenes infested by the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding achenes on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of achenes infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} achenes infested by the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and banded sunflower moth (Charlet and Gross, 1990). The red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposits in the developing achenes. The larvae feed on the developing kernels and when mature chew emergence holes in the pericarp (hull) (Oseto and Braness, 1979). The banded sunflower moth and sunflower moth oviposit on the bracts and florets. Early instars feed on the pollen and florets, later instars penetrate into achenes and feed on the developing kernels (Charlet et al., 1987, Charlet and Gross, 1990).

40|$|The mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sternochetus mangiferae (Fabricius), {{is one of}} {{the major}} mango insect pests in {{northern}} Australia. A reasonable level of control can be obtained with insecticide sprays together with orchard sanitation, but the only option available for organic growers is the latter. Weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), are effective in controlling the main insect pests in citrus, cashew and mango orchards. To determine whether weaver ants, which are usually abundant in non-sprayed mango orchards, have the potential to control the mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> field experiments together with regular monitoring programmes at six orchards in the Northern Territory of Australia were conducted from 2001 to 2003. Data from two conventional orchards showed that the treatment with weaver ants plus soft chemicals produced lower levels of downgraded fruits (< 0. 5 %) compared to the treatment with chemical insecticides (1. 4 - 2. 1 %). In three organic or insecticide-free orchards, fruits were much less damaged on trees with weaver ants (< 1 %) than on trees without the ants (2. 5 - 15. 7 %). In the sixth orchard, that had much higher mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations than the others, levels of downgraded fruits were lower on trees with abundant weaver ants than on trees with fewer weaver ants. We conclude that weaver ants are efficient biocontrol agents of the mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> and that for successful control of the pest it is important both to maintain the ants at high levels and to destroy excess fruits...|$|R

Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for cabbage stem flea beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - cabbage stem flea beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated.
