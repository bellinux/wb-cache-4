5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> appear as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{go all the way to}} the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|The Albanian {{communist}} government {{was criticized for}} its international reactions.

Many Chams were persecuted by the Albanian Communist regime, which, like the Greeks, believed that they had collaborated with the Italians and Germans during the Second World War. Many were therefore forced to flee to the United States, creating a new diaspora of Cham Albanians.|$|E

25|$|During the Portuguese Renaissance, {{the largest}} center of {{learning}} and arts was Lisbon, which thrived as a great city of Europe, because of its privileged position as a major trading center, open to a constant flow of new information, cultures, and finance. Lisbon was a true center of the European Renaissance, where artists and scholars {{from the corners of}} Europe came <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> rich. The rich Lisbon nobility funded countless paintings, often for either religious institutions in Lisbon or in their feudal estates. The Portuguese royal court often transferred between Lisbon, Coimbra, a former capital of Portugal, and Évora, which allowed these three cities to establish themselves as the largest centers of the Portuguese Renaissance. In Coimbra, the School of Coimbra was founded by Vicente Gil and his son, Manuel Vicente. In Évora, Manuel I of Portugal established a rich court, which would see its height under his son, Cardinal Infante Henrique of Aviz, Archbishop of Évora, who founded the University of Évora and its school of arts.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{was one of}} the few {{to raise}} the {{independence}} issue at this time, according to his memoirs because his [...] "instinct and training told me to be prepared for every contingency". During the Federation debate in the House of Assembly, he posited that since Southern Rhodesia was effectively choosing Federation over independence, a clause should be inserted into the bill guaranteeing Southern Rhodesia dominion status in the event of a Federal break-up. The United Party rejected this on the grounds that the Federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans. Smith was uncertain about the Federal project, but publicly supported it after the mostly white electorate approved it in a referendum in April 1953. He told the Rhodesia Herald that now it had been decided to pursue Federation, it was in Southern Rhodesia's best interests for everybody <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> succeed. He and other Rhodesia Party politicians joined the new Federal Party, headed by Huggins and Northern Rhodesia's Sir Roy Welensky, on 29 April 1953.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... we see her have to survive, and just to see her go on this journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her get to that place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks your heart, and hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the goal is <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{an engaging}} movie {{where you get}} some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E

2500|$|The {{third season}} begins with Grayson proposing to Jules {{in the season}} premier. With {{the help of the}} Cul-de-sac Crew, Grayson tricks Jules into being less {{predictable}} in her day-to-day life, but when she fails, Grayson is able to plan ahead and propose to her outside at night under a teepee'd tree. The season follows {{the ups and downs of}} their engagement, including their many trips to a new psychiatrist (played by guest star Nicole Sullivan). Laurie guilts Jules into letting her be Co-Maid of Honor (Co-Mo's!) with Ellie, much to Ellie's dismay. Travis gets into a skateboarding accident while being pulled by Dog Travis, and goes into the hospital. His injury causes him to wear a helmet for six episodes. Laurie falls for a guy via Twitter, a soldier from Iraq named Wade. Meanwhile, Bobby falls for Travis photography professor Angie (recurring guest star Sarah Chalke). In [...] "A One Story Town", Jules and the gang decide Bobby needs help with Angie so they start [...] "operation kiss-the-girl". With help from Ted and his a'capella group, they pull it off and Bobby and Angie get together. (This episode also signifies a special Scrubs cast reunion including: Christa Miller, Sarah Chalke, Bob Clendenin, Ken Jenkins, Sam Lloyd, Robert Maschio, and Zach Braff). One of Grayson's old hookups, Holly, returns with news that Grayson is the father of her baby. Although Jules is extremely upset at first, she comes to terms with the fact that baby girl Tampa will be in Grayson's life from now on. Bobby soon finds out that Angie is cheating on him, although she says they never agreed to be exclusive, and they break up. Ellie's mom is introduced, and no one will believ Ellie when she tries to tell the crew that her mother is a sociopath. When a hurricane strikes Gulfhaven, Travis and Laurie get closer than ever when Laurie can't decide what to do about her army boyfriend Wade. Although he has feelings for her, Travis wants to see Laurie happy, so he tells her <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work with Wade. [...] The hurricane destroys Grayson's house, causing him to move in with Jules. Grayson wants his and Jules's relationship to be more private and suggests that they elope to Napa, but Jules invites the whole group. While there, Travis and Laurie almost kiss but are interrupted when her boyfriend Wade comes back from Iraq to see her. The night of Travis's 21st birthday he gets drunk, strips, and tells Laurie that he has feelings for her and she is being unfair to him. Because Grayson's daughter isn't with them, Jules and Grayson decide not to elope, instead getting married on the beach near their home, but because beach weddings aren't legal there, it becomes a wedding on the go, and they walk down the beach as they say their vows.|$|E
