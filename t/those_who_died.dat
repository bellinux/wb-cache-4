25|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{differs from}} maximum life span. Life expectancy is an average {{for all people}} in the population — including <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>die</b> shortly after birth, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>die</b> in early adulthood (e.g. childbirth, war), and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> live unimpeded until old age. Lifespan is an individual-specific concept — maximum lifespan is therefore an upper bound rather than an average.|$|R
5|$|Alexis Helmer, a close friend, {{was killed}} during the battle on May 2. McCrae {{performed}} the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> at Ypres.

5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E

5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E
5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Normandy, between 13,632 and 19,890 French civilians were killed, and more were seriously wounded. In {{addition}} to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> during the campaign, 11,000 to 19,000 Normans are estimated to have been killed during pre-invasion bombing. A total of 70,000 French civilians were killed {{throughout the course of}} the war.

5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Memorials to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> {{are spread}} widely around the UK, {{and some of}} the crew are commemorated in {{different}} locations. One casualty, George David Spinner, is remembered on the Portsmouth Naval memorial, the Hood Chapel at the Church of St John the Baptist, in Boldre, Hampshire, and also on the gravestone of his brother, who died while serving in the Royal Air Force in 1942, in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> (comprising 78% of the {{fugitive}} victims) were young men aged between 16 and 30.

The overwhelming majority came from East Berlin and the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|The Flag of Bangladesh has a {{green field}} {{based on a}} similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It {{consists}} of a red disc {{on top of a}} green field.

The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} for the green and red colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E

50|$|The Catholic {{conception}} of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>die</b> in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. In the 1990s, the Catechism of the Catholic Church defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>die</b> {{in a state of}} grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.|$|R
