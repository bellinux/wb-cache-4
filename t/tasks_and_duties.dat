When {{not in use}} the jolly boat normally hung from davits at the stern of a ship, and could be hoisted {{into and out of}} the water. Jolly boats were used for transporting people and goods to and from shore, for carrying out inspections of the ship, or other small <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> that required only a small number of people, and did not need the use of the larger boats, such as the launch or cutter. Jolly boats were carried on practically all types of warships of the Royal Navy during the age of sail, from ships of the line down to sloops and brigs. Ships of the line would carry a barge, launch, pinnace, two cutters, all of various sizes, and a jolly boat, while the brigs might just carry a jolly boat and a cutter.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{shortly after}} the birth of Victoria, Prince Albert wrote a memoir {{detailing}} the <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> of all those involved with the royal children. [...] Another 48-page document, written {{a year and a half}} later by the Baron Stockmar, intimate of the royal couple, details the educational principles which were to be used with the little princes. The royal couple, however, had only a very vague idea of the proper educational development of a child. Queen Victoria, for example, believed that the fact that her baby sucked bracelets was a sign of deficient education. According to Hannah Pakula, biographer of the future German Empress, the first two governesses of the princess were therefore particularly well chosen. Experienced in dealing with children, Lady Lyttelton directed the Nursery through which passed all royal children after Victoria's second year. The diplomatic young woman managed to soften the unrealistic demands of the royal couple. Sarah Anne Hildyard, the children's second governess, was a competent teacher who quickly developed a close relationship with her students.|$|E
60|$|Pierson {{went down}} to his study to write his letter of resignation. Sitting before that blank sheet of paper, he {{realised}} to the full how strongly he had resented the public condemnation passed on his own flesh and blood, how much his action was {{the expression of a}} purely mundane championship of his daughter; of a mundane mortification. 'Pride,' he thought. 'Ought I to stay and conquer it?' Twice he set his pen down, twice took it up again. He could not conquer it. To stay where he was not wanted, on a sort of sufferance--never! And while he sat before that empty sheet of paper he tried to do the hardest thing a man can do--to see himself as others see him; and met with such success as one might expect--harking at once to the verdicts, not of others at all, but of his own conscience; and coming soon to that perpetual gnawing sense which had possessed him ever since the war began, that it was his duty to be dead. This feeling that to be alive was unworthy of him when so many of his flock had made the last sacrifice, was reinforced by his domestic tragedy and the bitter disillusionment it had brought. A sense of having lost caste weighed on him, while he sat there with his past receding from him, dusty and unreal. He had the queerest feeling of his old life falling from him, dropping round his feet like the outworn scales of a serpent, rung after rung of <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> performed day after day, year after year. Had they ever been quite real? Well, he had shed them now, and was to move out into life illumined by the great reality-death! And taking up his pen, he wrote his resignation.|$|E

The recruits arrive in groups of four, two girls and two boys, and they are tested over three episodes. Four groups of recruits are tested until only the four elite recruits remain. During the series more of the background of Caleb and the Roboidz is revealed through Cybele. Caleb is keen to learn of his past, but Cybele is reluctant to tell him. Caleb also gradually becomes used to being around children and starts to show that he is emotionally attached to them. Cybele regularly has to remind Caleb of his <b>task</b> <b>and</b> <b>duty</b> <b>and</b> to not let emotions get in the way.|$|R
