2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E

60|$|I murmured my <b>thanks,</b> and <b>very</b> {{deep and}} sincere were they. Then, having kissed his hand, I left him.|$|R

6000|$|Gombauld {{looked at}} the {{envelope}} {{and put it in}} his pocket unopened. [...] "Luckily," [...] he said, [...] "it isn't at all important. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> much all the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bitten!" [...] said Sally, dimpling. [...] "Oh, no, <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> much. I wasn't bitten. And I {{think it}} was awfully brave of you to save all our lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|Next Latha {{comes and}} asks {{the reason why}} he {{neglected}} her. He told {{the same thing and}} also tells" [...] if anyone gets interest and affection on one, learns much more of them. So Latha <b>thanks</b> Raja <b>very</b> much and takes leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! It is? Smiling,--yes; <b>thanks.</b> It's <b>very</b> good either way; very characteristic. It {{would be}} {{curious to know}} the origin of a saying like that. I imagine {{it goes back to}} the days of the first settlers. It {{suggests}} a wood-chopping period. Is it--ah--in general use?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{adventure}} made a {{good deal}} of noise in the circle of Albany; and I have reason to think that my own conduct was approved by those who heard of it. Bulstrode paid me an especial visit of <b>thanks,</b> the <b>very</b> day of my return, when the following conversation took place between us:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>thanks,</b> <b>very</b> much. Let us pour it.' And Dolly {{held the}} cup while Stuffy joyfully filled it; both very grateful, but rather afraid {{she had heard}} what went before the wish she fulfilled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll start next week. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> much. By the way, I {{shall have}} to go by boat, I suppose. It isn't far, is it? I've not been up the river for some time. The School {{generally}} goes down stream." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR S. C.,--Books {{received}} {{with great}} <b>thanks.</b> <b>Very</b> nice books, though I see you underrate my cecity: I {{could no more}} read their beautiful Bible than I could sail in heaven. However I have sent for another and can read the rest for patience.|$|E
6000|$|Once more my best <b>thanks</b> {{for your}} <b>very</b> polite attention; and do me the favor to believe me, {{with the most}} perfect sentiments of respect and regard, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you, Nita, but {{it would}} be better to destroy it, at once. It may be a long time before I come this way again; besides, the things have seen their best days, and I have another suit I can put on, when I join my regiment. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> much for your kindness, which I shall always remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said," [...] growled Baloo, for Mowgli had {{returned}} <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly {{for a minute}} on Mowgli's shoulder. [...] "A brave heart and a courteous tongue," [...] said he. [...] "They shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I. I'm {{supposed}} to be in training. Here I've been sitting gossiping when I ought to have been safely tucked up. I'll borrow your skull, if you can share it. Williams has had mine for a month. I'll take the little bones of your ear, too, if you are sure you won't need them. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> much. Never mind a bag, I can carry them very well under my arm. Good-night, my son, and take my tip as to your neighbour." ...|$|E

60|$|He would {{probably}} need no <b>thanks,</b> Clennam said. <b>Very</b> likely {{he would be}} thankful himself (and with reason), {{that he had had}} the means and chance of doing a little service to her, who well deserved a great one.|$|R
50|$|On October 16, 1976, the Soviet {{space ship}} Soyuz 23 unintentionally splashed {{down into the}} {{northern}} part of the lake, which was frozen, crashing through the ice. The crew was saved <b>thanks</b> to a <b>very</b> difficult but successful rescue operation.|$|R
60|$|Before they {{departed}} from the cave Margaret expressed her <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> earnestly to the outlaw and his wife for their kindness in receiving her and the little prince into their cave, {{and in doing so}} much for their comfort while there, although by so doing they not only encroached very much upon their own slender means of support, but also incurred a very serious risk in harboring such a fugitive. Having been plundered of every thing by the robbers in the wood, she had nothing but thanks to return to her kind protectors. The nobles who were now with her offered the wife of the outlaw some money--for they had still a small supply of money left--but she would not receive it. They would require all they had, she said, for themselves, before they reached Scotland.|$|E
60|$|Such bonds {{the reader}} may say, tie ninety {{out of every}} hundred people {{to each other in}} the present year of grace, but it is not to be {{observed}} that a like mutual confidence results. No, because the circumstances have changed. <b>Thanks</b> <b>very</b> largely to Dirk van Goorl and his fellows of that day, especially to one William of Orange, it is no longer necessary for devout and God-fearing people to creep into holes and corners, like felons hiding from the law, that they may worship the Almighty after some fashion as pure as it is simple, knowing the while that if they are found so doing their lot and the lot of their wives and children will be the torment and the stake. Now the thumbscrew and the rack as instruments for the discomfiture of heretics are relegated to the dusty cases of museums. But some short generations since all this was different, for then a man who dared to disagree with certain doctrines was treated with far less mercy than is shown to a dog on the vivisector's table.|$|E
6000|$|Blanche had mysteriously {{disappeared}} from her {{partners in the}} dance. Lady Lundie had mysteriously abandoned her guests. Blanche had not come back. Lady Lundie had returned with an artificial smile, and a preoccupied manner. She acknowledged that she was [...] "not very well." [...] The same excuse {{had been given to}} account for Blanche's absence--and, again (some time previously), to explain Miss Silvester's withdrawal from the croquet! A wit among the gentlemen declared it reminded him of declining a verb. [...] "I am not very well; thou art not very well; she is not very well"--and so on. Sir Patrick too! Only think of the sociable Sir Patrick being in a state of seclusion--pacing up and down by himself in the loneliest part of the garden. And the servants again! it had even spread to the servants! They were presuming to whisper in corners, like their betters. The house-maids appeared, spasmodically, where house maids had no business to be. Doors banged and petticoats whisked in the upper regions. Something wrong--depend upon it, something wrong! [...] "We had much better go away. My dear, order the carriage"--"Louisa, love, no more dancing; your papa is going."--"Good-afternoon, Lady Lundie!"--"Haw! <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> much!"--"So sorry for dear Blanche!"--"Oh, it's been too charming!" [...] So Society jabbered its poor, nonsensical little jargon, and got itself politely out of the way before the storm came.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of vortices in an inhomogeneous Gross-Pitaevskii equation i ∂_t u = Δ u + 1 ε^ 2 (p_ε^ 2 (x) - |u|^ 2). For a unique scaling regime |p_ε(x) - 1 | = O(|ε|^- 1), it is shown that vortices can interact both with the background perturbation and with each other. Results for associated parabolic and elliptic problems are discussed. Comment: 35 pages, 1 figure, typos corrected and reference added. Dramatically improved exposition <b>thanks</b> to <b>very</b> thorough Referee Repor...|$|R
50|$|The Smith Center has an {{excellent}} basketball atmosphere <b>thanks</b> to the <b>very</b> high seating capacity and strong demand for tickets.

60|$|To a {{thoughtful}} man, no {{point of the}} social horizon is more full of light, than the altered temper of the young gentlemen. They have their faults and follies still--for when will young blood be other than hot blood? But when one finds, more and more, swearing banished from the hunting-field, foul songs from the universities, drunkenness and gambling from the barracks; when one finds everywhere, whether at college, in camp, or by the cover-side, more and more, young men desirous to learn their duty as Englishmen, and if possible to do it; when one hears their altered tone toward the middle classes, and that word 'snob' (<b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> much to Mr. Thackeray) used by them in its true sense, without regard of rank; when one watches, as at Aldershott, the care and kindness of officers toward their men; and over and above all this, when one finds in every profession (in that of the soldier as much as any) young men who are not only 'in the world,' but (in religious phraseology) 'of the world,' living God-fearing, virtuous, and useful lives, as Christian men should: then indeed one looks forward with hope and confidence {{to the day when}} these men shall settle down in life, and become, as holders of the land, the leaders of agricultural progress, and the guides and guardians of the labouring man.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the time}} it takes to climb the steps to the court we tell the story of how the accused came to be here. We see the crime and we see the punishment. Nothing else. No police procedure, <b>thanks</b> <b>very</b> much, no coppers striding along {{corridors}} with coats flapping. Just crime and punishment - the two things that matter most in any crime drama.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{produced by}} Maule Air are tube-and-fabric designs and are popular with bush pilots, <b>thanks</b> to their <b>very</b> low stall speed, their tundra tires and oleo strut landing gear.

50|$|Her aesthethic and {{intellectual}} {{approach of the}} music is strongly linked to the thought of philosopher Gilles Deleuze she met in 1987.Pascale Criton takes interest most particularly in the considerations concerning the continuum. In regard to this, her compositional approach lies in going above the natural discontinuity of scales to reach some state of continuity while closing up the continuum <b>thanks</b> to <b>very</b> dense microtonal scales. (very small intervals et very close to each other). And she {{takes advantage of the}} very specific properties these microtonal scales have on the ear perception.|$|R
50|$|A {{third of}} the seats was in play. The councilmen and women from this class were {{previously}} elected during the Rotherham Council election, 2010, in which Labour swept 19 out of 21 wards with 44% of the votes, <b>thanks</b> to the <b>very</b> divided opposition (Conservative, UKIP, BNP as well as Independents).|$|R
