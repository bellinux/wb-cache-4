25|$|The {{success of}} all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, {{three-phase}} firing process which generated the red color of the vase clay and <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>of</b> the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800°C, with the resultant oxidization turning the vase a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950°C with the kiln's vents closed and green wood added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required the vents to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage.|$|E

She lived in Saltville, Virginia, for 15 years after the war, where she opened and taught at a school in a log cabin. She worked from 1880 to 1898 as principal of the Virginia Female Institute in Staunton, Virginia, a position for which Robert E. Lee had recommended her before his death ten years earlier.

Upon the death of her daughter Virginia, from complications in childbirth in 1898, Flora resigned from the Institute and moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where she helped Virginia's widower, Robert Page Waller, in raising her grandchildren. She died in Norfolk on May 10, 1923, after striking her head in a fall on a city sidewalk. She is buried alongside her husband and their daughter, Little Flora, in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{noted that}} the {{iridescent}} feathers described are not unique to the Guadeloupe amazon, as other freshly killed amazons also show this {{to a greater or}} lesser degree, especially the Saint Vincent amazon (Amazona guildingii). He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>of</b> the head and underparts of the Guadeloupe bird could have been the borders of the feathers, as seen in the imperial amazon, whereas the green may have been a sign of immaturity, like in the Saint Vincent amazon. He also likened the brownish green upperparts to those of a young Saint Vincent amazon, and suggested that the red [...] "rosettes" [...] mentioned by Du Tertre may have been scattered feathers in the wing covert feathers. Clark listed features of the imperial amazon which contrasted with those of the Guadeloupe amazon, such as its deep purple head and underparts, green upperparts, wings with dark brown, purple, green, blue and red feathers.|$|E
