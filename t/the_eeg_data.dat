40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hybrid approach based on clustering technique (CT) and least square {{support vector machine}} (LS-SVM) denoted as CT-LS-SVM for classifying two-class <b>EEG</b> signals. <b>The</b> study aims to extract representative features from <b>the</b> original <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> through <b>the</b> CT method and then to classify two-class <b>EEG</b> signals by <b>the</b> LS-SVM using these features as inputs. In order to test {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, the experiment is carried out on an epileptic <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> and a mental imagery tasks <b>EEG</b> <b>data.</b> <b>The</b> classification accuracy of the current method is compared to the previous reported methods of the literature.

50|$|Park's work explores {{visualizing}} emotive {{states and}} the subconscious. In Eunoia and Eunoia II, she controlled pools of water with her brain-waves. This was accomplished by having electroencephalography (E.E.G.) data to create sound-waves which were pushed through pools of water, causing them to ripple. Park sat {{in the center of}} the pools as this occurred. For Eunoia, Park separated <b>the</b> <b>E.E.G.</b> <b>data</b> into five emotions, each of which fed into one of five pools of water. For Eunoia II, she expanded her conception of brain activity to cover forty-eight pools of water, matching the forty-eight emotions described by philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Also, while Park strove to control her emotions in Eunoia in order to keep the pools of water still, she changed her approach in Eunoia II to focus on expressing emotions.|$|E
50|$|The {{auditory}} cortex has distinct {{responses to}} {{sounds in the}} gamma band. When subjects are exposed {{to three or four}} cycles of a 40 hertz click, an abnormal spike appears in <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data,</b> which is not present for other stimuli. The spike in neuronal activity correlating to this frequency is not restrained to the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex. It has been theorized that gamma frequencies are resonant frequencies of certain areas of the brain, and appear to affect the visual cortex as well. Gamma band activation (25 to 100 Hz) {{has been shown to be}} present during the perception of sensory events and the process of recognition. In a 2000 study by Kneif and colleagues, subjects were presented with eight musical notes to well-known tunes, such as Yankee Doodle and Frère Jacques. Randomly, the sixth and seventh notes were omitted and an electroencephalogram, as well as a magnetoencephalogram were each employed to measure the neural results. Specifically, the presence of gamma waves, induced by the auditory task at hand, were measured from the temples of the subjects. The OSP response, or omitted stimulus response, was located in a slightly different position; 7 mm more anterior, 13 mm more medial and 13 mm more superior in respect to the complete sets. The OSP recordings were also characteristically lower in gamma waves, as compared to the complete musical set. The evoked responses during the sixth and seventh omitted notes are assumed to be imagined, and were characteristically different, especially in the right hemisphere. The right auditory cortex has long been shown to be more sensitive to tonality, while the left auditory cortex has been shown to be more sensitive to minute sequential differences in sound, such as in speech.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the field}} of data mining, {{classification}} of data is being a difficult task for further analysis.

In this paper the classification filters such as Fast Hartley Transform (FHT) and Chebyshev filters are used to classify <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> signals. In a bulk data set of EEG signals, the signals are classified into many channels. Though various filters are available for classification, FHT with Chebyshev and FT tree only are taken to know the efficiency in classifying <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> signals. When these filters are applied to the data instances the percentage of correctly classified instances is high.
