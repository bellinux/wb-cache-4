5|$|The Americans buried {{their dead}} and resumed the retreat, <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> British rangers {{pursuing}} and firing occasionally from at long range. Williamson and Rose kept {{most of the}} men together by warning them that an orderly retreat was their only chance to get home alive. The Americans fell back more than , some on foot, before making camp. The next day, two American stragglers were captured and presumably killed before <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> rangers finally abandoned the chase. The main body of Americans reached Mingo Bottom on June 13. Many stragglers arrived in small groups for several days more. In all, about 70 Americans never returned from the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Jays and the Cleveland Indians {{currently}} {{hold the}} record for the longest Opening Day game in Major League history. They set that record on Opening Day 2012, when Jairo Asencio of the Indians gave up a 3-run home run {{in the top of the}} 16th inning to give the Blue Jays the win. This broke the record of 15 innings set between <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> the Detroit Tigers in 1960.|$|E
5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, and most of <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. <b>The</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941.

5|$|New Cleveland manager Lou Boudreau used Gromek as {{a relief}} pitcher in 1942. On July 12, facing the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium, Gromek entered {{the game in}} the fifth inning behind 6–5 with two outs and a runner on third. He struck out Al Evans to end the inning without further damage, and earned the win in extra innings, but walked three {{consecutive}} batters in the seventh, the third of which forced in a run. Shortly after the game, he was demoted to the double A Baltimore Orioles {{for the rest of the}} season, the result of an agreement <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> Orioles had made before the season began where the Indians would allow use of certain players during the season if requested. He finished the season with a 2–0 record and a 3.65 ERA in 14 appearances with <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> <b>and</b> a 4–6 record with a 5.14 ERA in 20 games with the Orioles. He spent the entire 1943 season with Baltimore, going 16–13 with a 3.34 ERA, with the exception of September, when he received a call up to the major leagues. There, he made three appearances, totaling four innings of work.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{began working}} to secure Kentucky's {{separation}} from Virginia {{as early as}} 1784.

He was a delegate to subsequent conventions in 1787, 1788, and 1789 that worked toward a constitution for Kentucky. During these conventions he helped thwart James Wilkinson's scheme to align Kentucky with the Spanish. In 1791 Shelby, Charles Scott and Benjamin Logan were among those chosen by the Virginia legislature {{to serve on the}} Board of War for the district of Kentucky. Shelby was also made High Sheriff on Lincoln County. In 1792, he was a delegate to the final convention that framed the first Kentucky Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Slavery in Indiana {{occurred}} {{between the time}} of French rule during the late seventeenth century and 1826, with a few traces of slavery afterward. When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region, slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> the French. When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800, William Henry Harrison, a former slaveholder, was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated {{through a series of}} laws enacted by the appointed legislature.|$|E
5|$|Thrones and Patriots added six new {{nations to}} the {{original}} Rise of Nations game. The 'New World' situation playable in the game was enhanced {{by the introduction of}} the European nation—the Dutch. Three North American nations were added, the Americans, referring to the ex-colonial civilization, and two Native American nations were added, which were the Lakota and the Iroquois. Two Asian nations, <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> the Persians, were introduced. The other nation to be added was the Dutch. New Wonders were made available for building, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Forbidden City, and the Red Fort.|$|E
5|$|Wayne {{originally}} intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, {{but by the time}} he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>and</b> the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} upon joining his new club, Gromek allowed nine earned runs in one inning in a 23–3 blowout loss to the Boston Red Sox. Despite the poor first outing, Tigers manager Fred Hutchinson decided that the veteran Gromek's best fit would be as a starter with his staff of young pitchers. His confidence paid off, as Gromek shut out Philadelphia in his next appearance, allowing four hits and cementing {{his role in the}} starting rotation {{for the rest of the}} season. In his third start for the Tigers on July 2, he faced <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> <b>and</b> defeated the team who had traded him three weeks prior, 4–2. He ended up facing the Indians two more times, winning in August and losing in September, his final start of the year. In his first season in Detroit, Gromek went 6–8 with a 4.51 ERA in 19 games, 17 of them starts.|$|E
