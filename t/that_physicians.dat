5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis.

5|$|Rossier {{first arrived}} in Japan in 1859, {{at a time when}} early {{experiments}} in photography were being conducted in Kyūshū, particularly in Nagasaki. The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> Jan Karel van den Broek and J.L.C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

50|$|The court {{dismissed}} the claim against the hospital {{on the ground}} <b>that</b> the <b>physicians</b> were not employees of the hospital. The plaintiffs' claims against the three physicians went to trial in 2005 in Manhattan. On July 1, 2005, after nine days of deliberations, a jury found <b>that</b> all three <b>physicians</b> had been negligent, but {{also found that the}} negligence of only one of the physicians had caused Schaap's death. <b>That</b> <b>physician</b> was a cardiologist who the plaintiffs had contended was negligent by not looking at the pre-operative chest X-ray. The jury awarded the plaintiffs a total of $1.95 million in damages.|$|R

25|$|According to Larson and Yao (2005), empathy should {{characterize}} physicians' {{interactions with}} their patients because, despite advancement in medical technology, the interpersonal relationship between physicians and patients remains essential to quality healthcare. Larson and Yao (2005) argue <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> consider empathy {{a form of}} emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> are more effective and enjoy more professional satisfaction when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the point of view <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the role}} of the {{physician}} and {{the meaning of the word}} itself vary around the world.

Experienced physicians perform fewer invasive procedures and charge less per visit, with no differences in health outcomes.

25|$|Although the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses {{universal}} immunization, {{they note}} <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> should respect parents’ refusal to vaccinate their children after sufficient advising {{and provided the}} child does not face a significant risk of infection.

25|$|Other {{members of}} the medical {{community}} deny {{the existence of such}} an institutional prejudice. A review in the Journal of Clinical Oncology denied <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> collude against unconventional treatments.

25|$|Patients with ESKD are at {{increased}} overall risk for cancer. This risk is particularly high in younger patients and gradually diminishes with age.

25|$|Retention {{of nurses}} by sending (often developing) {{countries}} {{can be addressed}} by improving working conditions, minimizing wage differentials, and promoting medical tourism. Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, there is growing evidence <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities. The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP. Others have suggested programs which require domestic service or employment upon graduation.|$|E

In the United States, the CDC has refused to impose a national requirement <b>that</b> <b>physicians</b> and hospitals report cases of the disease.
