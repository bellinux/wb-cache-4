5000|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>collectors,</b> {{also known}} as publicans, are {{mentioned}} {{many times in the}} Bible (mainly in the New Testament). They were reviled by the Jews of Jesus' day because of their perceived greed and collaboration with the Roman occupiers. <b>Tax</b> <b>collectors</b> amassed personal wealth by demanding tax payments in excess of what Rome levied and keeping the difference. They worked for tax farmers. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus sympathizes with the <b>tax</b> <b>collector</b> Zacchaeus, causing outrage from the crowds that Jesus would rather be the guest of a sinner than of a more respectable or [...] "righteous" [...] person.

50|$|Publican/tax {{collector}} {{is used as}} {{an example}} of a malignant group. These <b>tax</b> <b>collectors</b> were Jews in the employ of the Romans who would collect the Roman imposed taxes from the people.

St. Matthew, the traditional author of the Gospel of Matthew, was said to have been a <b>tax</b> <b>collector</b> before becoming a follower of Jesus.
