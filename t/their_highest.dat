In such systems the faradaic pseudocapacitance electrode with <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> capacitance provides high specific energy while the non-faradaic EDLC electrode enables high specific power. An advantage of the hybrid-type supercapacitors compared with symmetrical EDLC's is <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> specific capacitance value as well as <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> rated voltage and correspondingly <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> specific energy.|$|R

Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53.

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E
5|$|Dalglish's {{successor}} Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in {{his first}} full season in charge. In the newly formed Premier League, he struggled to sustain the club's domestic successes, {{and was replaced by}} Roy Evans midway through the 1993–94 season. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E

Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in 2013–14, <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> position in the Premier League and best finish since 1974–75. Stoke again finished in ninth position in 2014–15, which ended with a 6–1 victory against Liverpool. Despite breaking their transfer record twice (on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula), in 2015–16, Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in 2016–17, finishing in 13th position.|$|E

He and Washbrook put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for the opening stand during the series, as the hosts went on to make 496, <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> score for the series. The pair added another triple-figure partnership in the second innings. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E
