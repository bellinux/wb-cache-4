40|$|Abstract. A marked {{feature of}} the pebble {{divertor}} is an effect by use of functional multi-layer coated pebble, which consists of a surface plasma facing layer, an intermediate tritium permeation barrier layer, and a kernel for heat removal. The dimensions, structure and the irradiation conditions of pebbles are the important issues {{for the development of}} the pebble divertor. From the view point of resistance of the induced thermal stress, the pebble is taken as small as possible in size. On the other hand, from the view point of the pumping performance, the suitable irradiation temperature range of the surface layer of pebble was estimated from the experiments and the numerical analysis. The pumping process enhanced by dynamic retention is available to extend the higher allowable irradiation temperature range from 900 K to 1100 K. As taking the <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> <b>limitation</b> due to pumping effect and the fractural strength due to the induced thermal stress limitation, it was found that the diameter of the pebble is possible to be 1 - 2 mm in about 20 MW/m 2 for the SiC kernel and 2 - 3 mm in less than 30 MW/m 2 for the graphite kernel...|$|E

However, high-strength concrete mixes are often proportioned with low water contents which leads to incomplete hydration of cement contained therein.

In contrast, significant drops occur in annual mean temperatures at 1 station, winter temperatures at 3 stations, and summer temperatures at 5 stations. Approximately 50 % of stations with significant temperature variations are in the form of abrupt changes. The abrupt temperature changes all occurred in the 1970 s, most often in 1979 and 1980.

50|$|Plenum {{supply air}} <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is the {{increase}} of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air <b>temperature</b> <b>rise,</b> elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the supply air temperature causes {{a decrease in the}} <b>temperature</b> <b>rise.</b> The <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air <b>temperature</b> <b>rise,</b> thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|R

A newly developed semi-adiabatic curing test method with heat loss compensation applied was employed to measure the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of the concrete mixtures. The results reveal that, for a given paste volume, the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> would be highest at a water-cement ratio (w/c) of 0. 36; therefore, the adiabatic <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of a higher strength concrete is not necessarily higher.
