5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, {{but most of them}} have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E

It can also {{be prepared}} by electrolysis of thorium nitrates. It is stable from 260–450°C; at 470°C and above it continuously decomposes to become thoria. It easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate ThOCO3·xH2O and, under high-pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, Th(CO3)2·0.5H2O or Th(OH)2CO3·2H2O. Several mixed oxides are known, such as BaThO3, which has the perovskite structure.|$|E
25|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Additionally, many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4, white, m.p.1068°C) is most easily produced by reacting various thorium salts, thoria, or <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> with hydrogen fluoride: methods that involve {{steps in the}} aqueous phase are more difficult because they result in hydroxide and oxide fluorides {{that have to be}} reduced with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas. It has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. It is a white, hygroscopic powder: at temperatures above 500°C, it reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce the oxyfluoride ThOF2.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{mischmetal}} {{was prepared}} from monazite, an anhydrous phosphate {{of the light}} lanthanides and thorium. The ore was cracked by reaction at high temperature either with concentrated sulfuric acid, or with sodium <b>hydroxide.</b> <b>Thorium</b> was removed {{by taking advantage of}} its weaker basicity relative to the trivalent lanthanides, its daughter radium was precipitated out using entrainment in barium sulfate, and the remaining lanthanides were converted to their chlorides. The resulting [...] "rare earth chloride" [...] (hexahydrate), sometimes known as [...] "lanthanide chloride", was the major commodity chemical of the rare earth industry. By careful heating, preferably with ammonium chloride or in an atmosphere of hydrogen chloride, the hexahydrate could be dehydrated to provide the anhydrous chloride. Electrolysis of the molten anhydrous chloride (admixed with other anhydrous halide to improve the melt behavior) {{led to the formation of}} molten mischmetal, which would then be cast into ingots. Any samarium content of the ore tended not to be reduced to the metal, but accumulated in the molten halide, from which it could later be profitably isolated. Monazite-derived mischmetal typically was about 48% cerium, 25% lanthanum, 17% neodymium, and 5% praseodymium, with the balance being the other lanthanides. When bastnäsite started being processed for rare earth content in about 1965, it too was converted to a version of rare earth chloride, and on to mischmetal. This version was higher in lanthanum and lower in neodymium.|$|R
500|$|In another {{extraction}} method, monazite is decomposed with a 45% {{aqueous solution}} of sodium hydroxide at 140°C. Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first, filtered at 80°C, washed {{with water and}} dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Next, the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH = 5.8 that results in precipitation of <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (Th(OH)4) contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides; the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution. <b>Thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements. An efficient method is the dissolution of <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> in nitric acid, because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{more recent}} process uses hot sodium {{hydroxide}} solution (73%) at about 140 °C. This process allows the valuable phosphate {{content of the}} ore to be recovered as crystalline trisodium phosphate. The lanthanide/thorium hydroxide mixture can be treated with hydrochloric acid to provide a solution of lanthanide chlorides, and an insoluble sludge of the less-basic <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of uranium from non-conventional sources has its importance in the security of nuclear fuel supply as well as producing a more value-added product to the contaminated source. In this paper, uranium is recovered both by developing a hydrothermal process as well as using the removal method. Developing hydrothermal process involves using high uranium concentrated starting material such as xenotime and <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> waste produced from the monazite cracking process. Oxalate separation enable to produce a better uranium and thorium separation from the yttrium in xenotime {{as compared to the}} hydroxide precipitation. Also, a solvent extraction stage was included to separate the uranium from the thorium in the process using <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> waste. The removal method involves using selective leaching for minerals with lower uranium content such as zircon. A better removal for uranium and thorium in zircon is achieved when a heat treatment process was done prior to the leaching stage. White zircon mineral was produced after this treatment and its quality meets the requirement for white ceramic opacifier and glaze. ABSTRA...|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia, mineral {{processing}} plant {{is one of}} the Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) processing industries controlled by the Atomic Energy Licensing Board (AELB) through the enforcement of Atomic Energy Licensing Act 1984 (Act 304). The activities generated waste which is called as TENORM wastes. TENORM wastes are mainly found in <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> from the processing of xenotime and monazite, and iron oxide and red gypsum from the processing of ilmenite. Other TENORM wastes are scales and sludge from the oil and gas industries, tin slag produced from the smelting of tin, and ilmenite, zircon, and monazite produced from the processing of tin tailing (amang). The environmental and radiological monitoring program is needed to ensure that the TENORM wastes did not caused any contamination to the environment. The wastes vary in the types of samples, parameters of analysis as well as the frequency of monitoring based on license’s conditions issued by the AELB.

40|$|Structures, termed microbioids, comforming to {{bacteria}} {{in size and}} shape (e. g. rods, spheres, chains and clusters of spheres) have been observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on coalified Silurian and Lower Devonian spores, sporangia, cuticles and coprolites. Some were sectioned for transmission electron microscopy. The elemental composition of both microbioids and ‘substrates’ was investigated using a X-ray microanalysis system. These analyses combined with comparative studies on recent bacteria and cyanobacteria were undertaken to evaluate the biogenicity, nature and age of the microbioids. Spheres with a Si signature (0. 03 – 0. 5 μm diameter) and assumed composed of silica are interpreted as artefacts produced abiotically during the extraction procedures. A similar origin is proposed for hollow spheres that are composed of CaF 2. These occur singly, in short chains simulating filaments, and in clusters. Considerable differences in size (0. 2 – 2. 0 μm diameter) and appearance relate to local variation in the chemical environment during extraction. Spheres (0. 2 – 1. 5 μm diameter), that lack a mineral signature, with a framboidal surface ornament and occur within sporangia are identified as by-products of spore development. A biotic origin is also postulated for C-containing rod-shaped structures (> 3. 1 μm long, < 1. 4 μm wide), some with collapsed surfaces, although comparisons with living {{bacteria in}}dicate recent contamination. More elongate rod-shaped microbioids (< 8. 6 μm long, 1. 2 μm wide) {{have been identified as}} detrital rutile crystals (TiO 2). Minute naviculate structures (< 2. 2 μm long) resembling diatoms are of unknown origin but are probably composed of <b>thorium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Unmineralized filaments of cyanobacterial morphology are recent contaminants. Some of the sporangia and spore masses are partially covered by associations of fragmented sheets, interconnecting strands, rods and spheres that are interpreted as dehydrated biofilms. Being unmineralized they are probably also of recent origin, although they might have survived wild-fire along with the charcoalified mesofossils. Many of the structures illustrated here were initially identified casually as bacteria on the small fossils extracted for biodiversity studies using well-tried, conventional, palaeobotanical techniques. Our subsequent more detailed analyses have shown how such processes can produce artefacts that are morphological analogues of mineralized bacteria, leave residues that mimic bacterial shapes and, despite some efforts such as storage in dilute HCl to eliminate living bacteria, introduce contamination. They reinforce previous concerns that verification of the biogenicity and syngenicity of bacterial-like objects in ancient Earth and extra-terrestrial rocks should not only rely on size and morphological look-alikes, but must encompass a thorough understanding of fossilization processes and extraction techniques plus, ideally, other measures of biogenicity (e. g. biomarkers) and syngenicity...|$|E
