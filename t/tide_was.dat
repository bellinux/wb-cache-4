5|$|In Louisiana, {{damage was}} light, as the {{majority}} of Hanna's convective activity was to the east. Rainfall was mostly less than 1inches (25mm), and little rise in <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> reported. Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar effects were reported.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} rushing offense, LSU outgained Alabama 148 to 96 yards, led by Michael Ford {{who ran for}} 72rushing yards. The Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> led on the ground by Richardson, who carried the ball 23 times for 89yards. LSU, was led by Ford's 72rushing yards, and also saw Jefferson rush for 43yards on 11carries and Spencer Ware pick up 29yards on 16carries.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> {{excited by}} solar heating of water vapour in the {{troposphere}} and ozone in the stratosphere. Migrating <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> prominent {{components in the}} Mesospheric Lower Thermospheric (MLT) region. The vertical propagation characteristics of atmospheric tides over Trivandrum (8 °N, 77 °E) in the MLT region {{during the first year}} of observations (June 2004 to May 2005) using the All-sky SKiYMET meteor radar are reported. The diurnal <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> the prominent component observed. The amplitude and phase structure shows the vertical propagation of diurnal tides with vertical wavelength of ~ 25 km. The amplitude of meridional components is greater than that of zonal ones. The maximum observed amplitudes of diurnal <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> ~ 40 - 50 ms- 1 and that of semidiurnal <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> of 20 ms- 1. It is observed that terdiurnal <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> also significant in this region. A comparison with GSWM 00 shows similar phase structure but observed amplitudes are more than the model values. The tidal characteristics show significant seasonal variation and signatures of Semi-annual Oscillations are also seen. The observed amplitudes of diurnal <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> maximum during equinoxes...|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> also {{produced}} through the gravitational {{effects of the}} Moon. Lunar (gravitational) <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> much weaker than solar (thermal) <b>tides</b> and <b>are</b> generated by {{the motion of the}} Earth's oceans (caused by the Moon) {{and to a lesser extent}} the effect of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As {{soon as the}} <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> high enough, Mathew and his troops, {{accompanied by}} Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. They landed under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2009 season, the Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> ranked No.5 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. By week seven Alabama {{moved into}} the No.1 ranking in the AP Poll and the No.2 ranking in both the Coaches' Poll and the initial BCS rankings. After {{dropping}} as low as No.3, following the victory against Florida in the SEC Championship Game Alabama captured the No.1 ranking in the AP and Coaches' Polls {{as well as in}} the final BCS rankings. Following the victory over Texas in the BCS Championship Game, Alabama was selected a unanimous No.1 by the AP and as the No.1 team in the Coaches' Poll.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> in favour of the regency, until, in the summer of 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E
50|$|The way to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} tidal flow at the narrows is to observe the direction in which the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> flowing. If the tidal flow is heading toward theJervis Inlet then the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> going out (low tide). But if the flow is moving toward Princess Louisa Inlet the <b>tide</b> it <b>is</b> coming in (high tide).|$|R

5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to be played on November 20, in July 2010 this game was moved to Thursday, November 18 to give the Crimson Tide extra {{time to prepare for}} its game against Auburn. In the first ever meeting against the Georgia State Panthers, the Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> victorious 63–7. Alabama scored first on an eight-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones. After a Mark Barron interception ended the first Georgia State drive, Alabama responded with a 71-yard drive capped by a one-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run to take a 14–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
50|$|The head of <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} in surveying, navigation, and fisheries management, and thus many jurisdictions establish a legal head of tide. As {{the head of}} <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> useful for navigation, separate maps can {{be made of the}} tidal zones up to the head of <b>tide,</b> such as <b>was</b> done in New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> global-scale {{periodic}} oscillations of the atmosphere. In {{many ways}} they are analogous to ocean tides. Atmospheric tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy {{input into the}} lower atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, while dominating {{the dynamics of the}} mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Therefore, learning about atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>is</b> essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Modeling and observations of atmospheric <b>tides</b> <b>are</b> needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} kitesurfing {{is becoming}} more and more popular in the area. It is an ideal location for learning when the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> out and when the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> in because of the shallow depths and more often than not, flat water.|$|R
5|$|To the east, the Washington, D.C. {{area was}} {{particularly}} affected, and considerable flooding {{was reported in}} the Virginias and Maryland. Much of the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD were flooded and the Midshipmen were put to work the next day cleaning up debris. New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> low enough, but to the south in Chesapeake Bay, the majority of crab pots were destroyed. Hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the Allegheny Mountains, which raised rivers and streams in the Pittsburgh area significantly above the flood mark. In Pennsylvania, the winds were still high enough to unroof several homes.|$|E
5|$|After {{their victory}} over Notre Dame in the BCS National Championship Game, Alabama's final team {{statistics}} were released. On the defensive {{side of the}} ball, of the 120 FBS teams, the Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> ranked {{near the top of}} all major defensive categories nationally and first in all categories in conference. They ranked first in total defense (250.00 yards per game), scoring defense (10.93 points per game) and rushing defense (76.36 yards per game) and ranked seventh in passing defense (173.64 yards per game). Individually, C. J. Mosley led the team with 107 total tackles, 41 of which were assisted, and 66 solo tackles. Adrian Hubbard was tied for 73rd nationally, 8th in conference and 1st on the team with 7 quarterback sacks. Hubbard was also 20th in conference and 1st on the team with 11 tackles for loss. Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix was tied for 30th nationally, 3rd in conference and 1st on the team with five of Alabama's 18 total interceptions of the season.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. The first play of that drive resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E
5|$|Early on 23 February Willaumez sailed again, {{taking his}} fleet southwards towards the Pertuis d'Antioche near Rochefort after sending the {{schooner}} Magpye into Lorient with orders for Troude {{to follow him}} to the rendezvous. Troude found that the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> too low to sail at once, and so sent a squadron of three frigates ahead, {{under the command of}} Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien. These frigates were the 40-gun Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle, which sailed together on the evening of 23 February southwards in the direction of Belle Île. Their departure had been observed by Beresford's force, which remained off Lorient to watch Troude but sent the 38-gun frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and 18-gun brig-sloop HMS Doterel under Commander Anthony Abdy in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2010 season, the Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> ranked No.1 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. The No.1 preseason ranking was {{the first}} for Alabama since the 1978 season. In week six, Alabama dropped to the No.8 ranking in both the AP and Coaches' Poll {{following}} their loss to South Carolina. The Tide rebounded in the rankings though week nine, rising to No.5 before dropping to No.11 in the AP and No.12 in the Coaches' Poll following their loss at LSU. After their loss to Auburn, Alabama dropped to No.15 in the AP, No.18 in the Coaches' Poll and No.16 in the final BCS standings. Following the victory over Michigan State in the Capital One Bowl, Alabama finished No.10 in the final AP, No.11 in the final Coaches' Polls.|$|E

After their 9–6 loss against the Tigers, Alabama dropped to No.4 in all but the BCS {{standing}} where they dropped to No.3. The Crimson Tide regained their No.2 ranking in all of the polls after Oklahoma State was upset by Iowa State, and retained the No.2 position {{through the end of the}} regular season to qualify for the BCS National Championship Game.

5|$|In {{the home}} opener for the 2012 season, Alabama {{shut out the}} Hilltoppers of Western Kentucky University (WKU) 35–0. To open the game, Alabama scored on a 14-yard AJ McCarron {{touchdown}} pass to Christion Jones that capped a four-play, 72-yard drive. On the WKU drive that ensued, Nico Johnson forced a Marquis Sumler fumble that was recovered by Damion Square at the WKU 49-yard line. However, the Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover after McCarron was sacked twice and were forced to punt. The defense responded on the next drive with their second recovered fumble of the game. This time, Adrian Hubbard caused the Antonio Andrews fumble that was recovered by Brandon Ivory at the WKU 33-yard line. On the next play, McCarron threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood for a 14–0 Crimson Tide lead.|$|E
5|$|Quarterback Doc Kuhn {{started the}} second half after sitting out the first because of injuries, invigorating the Commodores. The second scoring drive started when Paul Stumb intercepted a pass. Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end before Kuhn {{connected}} with Tot McCullough for a 25-yard pass. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining few yards for the touchdown. Alabama {{had a chance to}} score, making it to Vanderbilt's 18-yard line. The Commodore defense prevailed, Alabama's forward passes failed, and the ball went over on downs. Other chances included Alabama halfback Rosenfeld intercepting a pass with a clear field ahead of him, returning it 32 yards before Vanderbilt's Red Rountree tackled him from behind. Alabama back Charles Bartlett also returned a punt 25 yards before he was tackled by the last Commodore who could have done so. The Crimson <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> captained by sophomore end Al Clemens, later captain of the first Alabama team coached by Wallace Wade.|$|E
