5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|The final {{sections}} of the text discuss {{the need for a}} Guru (teacher) along with the duties of a yogin, and what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> one realizes one has made a mistake. The last chapter briefly discusses the kundalini, the benefits of yoga and the nature of calmness, contentedness in one's mind and consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E

I did not believe it, but I thought that I would come and see.' ...|$|R
5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|Upon Ivan's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his simple-minded son Feodor. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in {{maintaining}} exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom {{open to all}} foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by the new Tsar's late father. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent Boris Godunov that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor {{with two of his}} titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.|$|E

5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For parashah Tazria, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Saba, the maqam that symbolizes a covenant (brit). This is appropriate, because this parashah commences with the discussion of what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> a baby boy is born. It also mentions the brit milah, a ritual that shows a covenant between man and God.|$|E

25|$|A sizable Sephardic {{community}} {{had settled in}} Morocco and other Northern African countries, which were colonized by France in the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the décret Crémieux (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and laws, which many did not want <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> <b>When</b> France withdrew from Algeria in 1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some tensions between some of those communities and the earlier French Jewish population (who were mostly Ashkenazi Jews), and with Arabic-Muslim communities.|$|E
25|$|The pre-parade segment {{today may}} include mass-displays, choir {{performances}}, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances {{to entertain the}} crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became {{an integral part of}} the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> the parade proper begins.|$|E
