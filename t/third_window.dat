The church {{was built in}} 1852, destroyed during the First World War, and rebuilt again in 1929. Upon entering the church, the venerable Saint is seen {{depicted on}} the <b>third</b> <b>window</b> in the nave, on the right side, holding three bread rolls placed {{on top of the}} Gospel.|$|E

25|$|The {{northwest}} side {{can be broken}} down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to the bedroom window. The <b>third</b> <b>window,</b> looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E
25|$|Median power {{frequency}} {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} track fatigue using EMG. Using the median {{power frequency}}, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the <b>third</b> <b>window</b> could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.|$|E
500|$|The east window, {{designed}} by Brown, dominates {{the east end}} of the cathedral, rising above the reredos, and is based on the theme of the Te Deum laudamus. [...] At the top of the window is the risen Christ, and around and below are members of the heavenly choir. [...] Under this are four lancet windows, each representing one of the communities praising God. [...] The left window represents 'the company of the apostles', with Saint Raphael at the top. [...] Below are fourteen figures; the twelve apostles, excluding Judas Iscariot but including Saint Matthias, with Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas. [...] The next window commemorates 'the goodly fellowship of the apostles'. At the top is Saint Michael, with fifteen figures below. [...] These include Isaiah, Elijah, John the Baptist, Saint Athanasius, Saint Augustine, John Wycliffe, Thomas Cranmer, and John Wesley. [...] The <b>third</b> <b>window</b> represents 'the noble army of martyrs', with Archangel Gabriel at the top. [...] Below are fifteen Christian martyrs, starting with Saint Stephen. [...] Underneath are Zechariah and the Holy Innocents, Saint Alban, Saint Oswald, and Saint Boniface. [...] At the bottom are figures representing martyrs from Madagascar, Africa, Melanesia, and China. [...] The lancet window on the right commemorates 'the holy church throughout all the world', with an angel, possibly Uriel, at the top. [...] Underneath are various representations: King Alfred as a warrior, Dante as a poet, Fra Angelico as a painter, the musician J.S.Bach, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the physician Thomas Linacre. [...] Other figures commemorate law, commerce, scholarship, and architecture. [...] Also included are Christopher Columbus and Francis Drake.|$|E

2500|$|Beebe and Barton {{conducted}} {{several more}} dives in 1932, including both dives to document deep-sea {{animals and the}} shallower contour dives.

2500|$|Beebe and Barton {{resumed their}} dives in 1932, this time {{launching}} the Bathysphere {{from a single}} ship called the Freedom instead of the Ready and the Gladisfen. They had arranged a plan with NBC whereby their observations relayed up the phone line would be broadcast nationally over the radio. [...] Barton also hoped to film deep-sea creatures from inside the Bathysphere. [...] Beebe normally observed the depths {{through one of the}} Bathysphere's three windows since the searchlight was shone through the second, and a steel plug had been in place of the third, but this was changed when Barton had the steel plug replaced with a <b>third</b> <b>window</b> in order to film through it. [...] When conducting an unmanned test of the Bathysphere with the <b>third</b> <b>window</b> installed, they found it almost entirely full of water. [...] Realizing the immense pressure that the water must be under, Beebe ordered his crew to stand clear and began loosening the hatch's bolts to remove the hatch himself. [...] Beebe described the experience that followed this in his book Half Mile Down: ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{replacing}} the <b>third</b> <b>window</b> with the steel plug and conducting another unmanned test, {{the same problem}} happened again. [...] Beebe later described {{what would have happened}} to him and Barton had they been inside the sphere on a dive during which it leaked. [...] They would not have had time to drown: due to the immense pressure, [...] "the first few drops of water would have shot through flesh and bone like steel bullets." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barton's design {{called for}} a spherical vessel, as a sphere is the best {{possible}} shape for resisting high pressure. [...] The sphere had openings for three [...] windows made of fused quartz, the strongest transparent material then available, as well a 400-pound/181.436 kilogram entrance hatch {{which was to be}} bolted down before a descent. [...] Initially only two of the windows were mounted on the sphere, and a steel plug was mounted in place of the <b>third</b> <b>window.</b> [...] Oxygen was supplied from high-pressure cylinders carried inside the sphere, while pans of soda lime and calcium chloride were mounted inside the sphere's walls to absorb exhaled CO2 and moisture. [...] Air was to be circulated past these trays by the Bathysphere's occupants using palm-leaf fans.|$|E
2500|$|The Hotel Astoria (later John Jacob Astor Hotel) was {{designed}} by architects Tourtellotte & Hummel , who were based in Portland from 1922 to 1930 and who, after the Astoria project, designed two other hotels that are now NRHP-listed: the Lithia Springs Hotel (Ashland, Oregon) and the Redwoods Hotel (Grants Pass, Oregon). [...] Constructed of reinforced concrete, the eight-story John Jacob Astor Hotel building features Gothic decorative elements. The seventh floor is decorated with several escutcheons, one every <b>third</b> <b>window,</b> and the window groups at the building's corners at this level are additionally topped by rounded arches [...] "embellished with elaborate cartouches in cast stone". [...] Each group of three windows at the mezzanine level, or second floor, includes two Corinthian pilasters and is topped by a pointed arch and a frieze with three small shields above. [...] The lobby is two stories high at its center and includes numerous Corinthian columns. [...] It originally included a large fireplace and [...] "an elegant wrought-iron chandelier with parchment shades over electric candles".|$|E

The east window is to the memory of Samuel Aldersey who died in 1855, and the {{southeast}} window is in memory of Hugh Robert Aldersey who died aged20 in 1848. [...] Both of these windows are by Wailes. A <b>third</b> <b>window</b> is by Frampton in memory of Canon Royd's son, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy who died of wounds in 1884. [...] The altar was given in 1912 in memory of Albert Lowe and the carved oak reredos was given in the same year as a memorial to Catherine Hughes. The communion rails date from 1833. [...] The processional cross was given in memory of John James Rutter, a churchwarden from 1917 to 1926, whilst the litany desk was given in memory of Thomas Moore, the rector's warden for 55years, and his wife Mary Ellen. [...] At the west end of the church are two bibles, a Breeches Bible and a Bishop's Bible.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, during the Napoleonic wars, {{the church was}} seriously {{neglected}} and half of it {{was turned into a}} hospice for the poor of the city.

When they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed, half the room littered with splintered glass, and one big flint lying on the writing table.
